3′-end processing of RNA is a key regulatory mechanism that affects gene expression. In this study, the authors conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals. They found that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. The authors validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of distinct RNA length forms. They also established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation. The findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation.
 The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge . Here , we used deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .
 Our study shows that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .
 The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) has been implemented in 83 countries since 2000, with the goal of eliminating the disease through annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs to at-risk individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
α-synuclein ( α-syn ) is a protein that accumulates in the brains of people with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ). Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in the glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) gene confer a strong risk for sporadic PD . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , researchers generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and α-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD .
 Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can induce a robust cell-mediated immune response to sub-lethal infection. The capacity of L . monocytogenes to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cell cytosol is paramount for the induction of long-lived CD8 T cell–mediated protective immunity. Here, we show that the impaired T cell response to L . monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation, but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response. This suppression limited not only the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L . monocytogenes, but negated the response to bacteria within the cytosol. Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L . monocytogenes prevented the generation of acquired immunity and limited expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to the cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain alone. Bacteria confined to a phagosome suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10. Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restored protective immunity. Our studies demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells.
 Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common subtype. In this study, the authors sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous coding variants, including five rare and one common variant, Asn141His (rs33912345), which was associated significantly with POAG. These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure. Five variants found primarily in POAG cases were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant found only in controls was benign. One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation. Finally, the authors identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele (His141) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele (Asn141). The authors hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.
 The human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile produces flagella that promote adherence to intestinal epithelial cells and contribute to diarrheal disease development. Flagellar gene expression is regulated by the alternative sigma factor σD, which is encoded in the early stage flagellar operon. Here, the authors report the identification of a phase variable switch that controls the expression of flagellar and toxin genes. The switch is located upstream of the flgB operon, which contains the early stage flagellar genes. The orientation of the switch determines whether flagellar and toxin genes are expressed or not. The authors provide evidence that gene regulation through the switch occurs post-transcription initiation and is mediated by a C . difficile-specific regulatory factor. Lastly, the authors show that the tyrosine recombinase RecV is responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. The phase variable flagellar motility and toxin production suggest that these important virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during the course of infection.
 Spores are dormant cells that are highly resistant to environmental stresses. They are formed by a process called sporulation, which is common in many bacterial species. In this study, the authors investigated the process of sporulation in the intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile. They used a combination of cytological and genetic methods to describe the sequence of sporulation events and the function of the cell type-specific sigma factors that control gene expression during sporulation. The authors found that the forespore and mother cell programs of gene expression are less tightly coupled during sporulation in C. difficile compared to other sporeformers. This finding provides a platform for further studies of the regulatory network and the effector genes that are specific to C. difficile.
 We present a framework to model the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable. This reduction can closely replicate the steady state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models. Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant. The reduction makes this framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications, where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously. As an application, we analyze a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast, which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth. We show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch. In particular, this system incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred.
 Quorum sensing ( QS ) is a process that enables bacteria to coordinate their behavior in response to population density . The interplay between different components of the QS system is complex and context-dependent . In this study, we used a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to decipher the network connectivity and signal transduction in the autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) QS system of E . coli . We found that negative and positive feedback mechanisms were embedded in the network architecture and that a new unreported negative feedback interaction was present. We also revealed the importance of the LsrR regulator in the E . coli QS "switch" . Our simple model allowed us to understand the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network. This "bottom up" approach in understanding gene regulation will help us unravel complex QS network architectures and lead to the directed coordination of emergent behaviors.
 The study aimed to investigate the effect of schistosomiasis on malaria infection in school-age children living in rural communities in Gabon. The study found that schistosomiasis increased the risk of malaria infection in children, particularly in those aged 6-10 years old. The study also found that soil-transmitted helminths (STH) enhanced the risk of malaria infection in schistosomiasis-positive children. The study suggests that schistosomiasis and STH enhance the risk of malaria infection in children, and when infected, schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children. The study provides important information for the development of effective interventions to control malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, where both schistosomiasis and malaria are prevalent.
 Inflammation is necessary for promoting, sustaining, and tuning CD8+ T cell responses to infections. In this study, we investigated the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donovani infection. Our data demonstrate that IRF-5-mediated inflammation limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1α in dendritic cells. Ablation of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells resulted in a higher frequency of short-lived effector cells, enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and significantly reduced parasite burden. These findings suggest that induction of HIF-1α may represent an immune evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections.
 The current study is a systematic review of the literature on potential predictors of adverse outcomes and death in American visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ). The review included 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed using meta-analysis. The strongest predictors of adverse outcomes were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and age >40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnoea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with adverse outcomes. The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far. The results of this review can be used to identify and handle VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations.
 Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by parasites from the genus Leishmania. It is endemic in many parts of the world, including Algeria, where it is a major public health concern. The treatment of leishmaniasis is based on antimony-containing drugs, but there are reports of treatment failure and antimony resistance. In this study, we determined the antimony susceptibility of Leishmania isolates from Algeria. We found that the frequency of antimony-resistant isolates has increased over time, particularly for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Our results highlight the need for the development of effective methods to detect antimony resistance in Leishmania parasites to prevent the spread of drug-resistant strains.
 Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the digestive tract. The relationship between CD and acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium is not well understood. In this study, we developed two new models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD. We found that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, with an attendant increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. Our results suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. Importantly, our data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals.
 In flowering plants, the egg and sperm cells form within haploid gametophytes. The female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, which are flanked by five accessory cells. Both gametic and accessory cells are vital for fertilization; however, the mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown. In a screen for regulators of egg cell fate, we isolated the lachesis (lis) mutant which forms supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4, indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions.
 The use of footwear in the prevention of Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) is gaining increasing attention. Better understanding of the behaviors that influence use of footwear will lead to improved ability to measure shoe use and will be important for those implementing footwear programs. Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, we assessed social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological needs influencing whether and when children wear shoes in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis. Information was gathered from 242 respondents using focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and extended case studies. Shoe-wearing norms were said to be changing, with going barefoot increasingly seen as ‘shameful’. Shoes were thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold. However, many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice. Limited financial resources meant that people were neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of the preferred quality. As a result of this limited access, shoes were typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reached a certain age. While some barriers (for example fit of shoe and fear of labeling through use of a certain type of shoe) may be applicable only to certain diseases, underlying structural level barriers related to poverty (for example price, quality, unsuitability for daily activities, and low risk perception) are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs. Using well-established conceptual models of health behavior adoption, we identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention and which we anticipate will be of benefit to those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution.
α-herpesviruses, such as pseudorabies virus (PRV), are known to target axons of infected neurons for efficient spread within the nervous system. The PRV Us9 protein plays a central role in this process by directing viral structural proteins and capsids to axons. In this study, the authors found that PRV Us9 is associated with lipid rafts, which are small, dynamic microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. The authors also found that reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. These findings suggest that PRV Us9 plays a key role in the efficient targeting of viral structural proteins to axons by associating with lipid rafts.
 We found that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway regulates nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast growth rate and stress tolerance.  Specifically , we found that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway regulates the activity of the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 , which control the expression of stress-response genes.  We found that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway regulates the activity of Msn2 and Msn4 in a way that is independent of the stress-response elements in their cis-regulatory regions.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a rapidly evolving alphavirus that has recently spread from Asia to the Americas, causing severe febrile disease in humans. In this study, we used deep-sequencing technologies to characterize the genetic diversity present in CHIKV-infected individuals from Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands in the center of the epidemic. We found that the consensus sequence of CHIKV had changed over time, and that a diverse range of minority variants were present at various levels in the population. Furthermore, we identified a novel 3’ untranslated region (UTR) structure that led to increased replication in insect cells. These findings highlight the need to continue viral diversity surveillance over time as this epidemic evolves in order to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV.
 The mTOR signaling pathway regulates cell growth and is involved in multiple human diseases. In this study, we identified a previously unannotated gene, UBTOR, as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. Reducing UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth and cell growth in HEK293T and U87MG cells. UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in HEK293T and T24 cells. We found that UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR and mTOR complexes, and UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR and regulates DEPTOR’s ubiquitination. Ubtor gene disruption in zebrafish increases mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS (G12V) induced neoplasia in the intact animals. Ubtor depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft-bearing mice. Together, our results demonstrate how Ubtor regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling.
 The unicellular flagellated parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Nagana in cattle. The life cycle of T. brucei comprises an insect stage (procyclic stage) and a mammalian stage. Trypanosomatid parasites are highly diverged from well-studied eukaryotes such as yeast and mammals, resulting in a lack of sequence similarity with model organisms for the majority of their proteins. Protein interaction maps offer an invaluable resource for functional annotation of proteins. In this study, we systematically interrogated the co-complex interactions of more than 3354 protein groups in the procyclic life stage of T. brucei using in-depth biochemical fractionation. Our analysis led to the identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 protein groups that lacked experimental annotation. These complexes correlate well with known pathways as well as for proteins co-expressed across the T. brucei life cycle. We validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery, identifying a candidate potentially involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei. Our data provide an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T. brucei, and serve as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins. The presented results in this study are available at: www.TrypsNetDB.org.
 Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic lung disease that can also affect other organs, including lymph nodes (LNs). LNs are important sites for the immune response to TB, but the dynamics of infection and the effect of TB on LN structure and function are not well understood. We surveyed thoracic LNs from Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, analyzing PET CT scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. We found that Mtb grows to the same level in LNs of both macaque species, but cynomolgus macaques are better able to control the infection compared to rhesus macaques. In comparison with granulomas in the lung, thoracic LNs have limited abilities to kill Mtb. Granulomas that form in LNs disrupt LN structures and greater destruction of the LN structure is associated with higher Mtb burden. Our data support that LNs are a niche for persistent infection and are likely to play a larger role in the pathogenesis of TB than previously appreciated.
 Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that infect a wide range of animals, including humans. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidian infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here, we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike N. parisii, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.
 Chemokine receptors are important for the immune system and play a role in cancer metastasis and HIV infection. They can form homo- or heterodimers, which can affect their function. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the homo- and heterodimerization of three chemokine receptors: CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2. We found that the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 share common features with regard to dimerization and interactions with cholesterol that differ from the previously reported characteristics of CXCR4. We also provide the first structural information about chemokine receptor heterodimers and elucidate the role of cholesterol in differentiating between the heterodimerization of CXCR4 and the CC chemokine receptors.
 We report on a new form of systemic leishmaniasis, which we refer to as "atypical." This form of leishmaniasis presents with symptoms that are different from the classical form, such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. We found that 19.4% of 160 patients referred to our specialized laboratory had close to normal laboratory profiles but exhibited dysfunctional macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites. This finding suggests that systemic leishmaniasis presents with a much wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously thought. Furthermore, we found that adults can also be affected by this disease. Our recommendation is to entertain the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in any patient with an unexplained depressed immunity state and in whom no obvious immunologic defect can be identified.
12 million unique human sequence variants exist in the dbSNP database, but few are associated with any particular phenotype or disease. Computational methods are used to identify potentially disease-causing variants. We have developed a new approach that examines the locations of variants in paralogous proteins. Our analyses demonstrate that variants are correlated in paralogous proteins and that if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. This information can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants and prioritize them for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
 Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and causes severe disease in humans. In this study, the authors used RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression of 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. They found that parasites causing severe malaria had decreased glycolysis without activating compensatory pathways, altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation, reduced surface expression of PfEMP1, and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. They also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to—or are selected by—the host environment in severe malaria.
 The development of a preventive vaccine against HIV-1 is a difficult task due to the virus's ability to evade the host immune system. One promising approach is to use adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we used AAV vector to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG1 form to rhesus monkeys. We achieved persisting levels of delivered mAb as high as 270 μg/ml, but host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys. Despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus, six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed clear protective effects against repeated, marginal dose intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac239. These protective effects included lowering of viral load at peak height, lowering of viral load at set point, and delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of the infectious virus exposure. The monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 i.v. challenges, including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i.v. infectious units. Our results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in people, but the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized.
 The assumption that protein molecules respond linearly to thermal noise or structural perturbations is commonly used in studies of protein dynamics. However, we found that this assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations in the motor proteins myosin V and kinesin KIF1A. The normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions in KIF1A. These results indicate that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered. Neither a single normal mode nor a superposition of such modes yields an approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics.
 The endocytic pathway is a process by which cells internalize molecules from the extracellular environment. There are several different types of endocytosis, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). CIE is further divided into several different pathways, including the CLIC/GEEC pathway. The CLIC/GEEC pathway is a high capacity route for bulk fluid intake in fibroblasts and is regulated by the small GTPase Cdc42. In this study, we used a combination of fluid phase markers and pulse-chase experiments to study the CLIC/GEEC pathway. We found that CLICs, the primary carriers in this pathway, bud rapidly from the plasma membrane and acquire Rab5 and EEA-1, maturing into the GEEC stage before fusion with early endosomes. We also found that over-expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1) inhibits dynamin-independent internalization of cholera toxin subunit b (CTxB) and fluid phase markers. Our studies reveal complex crosstalk between the CLIC/GEEC pathway and caveolae at multiple levels.
 Two-component signaling systems are important for sensing and responding to environmental stimuli in bacteria, archaea, and plants. These systems typically involve a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a REC domain on a conserved aspartate residue. However, some REC domains lack this aspartate residue, which raises questions about their function and regulation. In this study, we compiled all deposited REC domains missing the phosphorylatable aspartate residue and named them Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains. We found that ALR domains are surprisingly common and are enriched for when attached to more rare effector outputs. Analysis of our informatics and the available ALR atomic structures, combined with structural, biochemical, and genetic data of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae presented here, suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to instead take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. This work defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains.
Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a promising new class of anticancer agents that have shown efficacy in clinical trials and practice. Most OVs gain cancer specificity from deletions/mutations in genes that counteract the host response, and grow selectively in cancer cells defective in anti-viral response. However, because of the deletions/mutations, they are frequently attenuated or over-attenuated. We developed next-generation OVs that carry no deletion/mutation, gain cancer specificity from specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors, and are fully virulent in the targeted cancer cells. The type of immunotherapy they elicit was not predictable, since non-attenuated HSVs induce and then dampen the innate response, whereas deleted/attenuated viruses fail to contrast it. We report on the first efficacy study of HER2-retargeted, fully-virulent OVs in immunocompetent mice. Our results show that the unarmed R-LM113 and the IL-12-armed R-115 inhibited the growth of the primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 (HER2-LLC1) tumor, R-115 being constantly more efficacious. All the mice that did not die because of the primary treated tumors were protected from the growth of the contralateral untreated tumors. The long-term survivors were protected from a second contralateral tumor, providing additional evidence for an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis of the local response highlighted that particularly R-115 unleashed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, i.e. induced immunomodulatory cytokines, including IFNγ, T-bet which promoted Th1 polarization. Some of the tumor infiltrating cells, e.g. CD4+, CD335+ cells were increased in the tumors of all responders mice, irrespective of which virus was employed, whereas CD8+, Foxp3+, CD141+ were increased and CD11b+ cells were decreased preferentially in R-115-treated mice. The durable response included a breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and the wt tumor cells, and underscored a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response.
The current study investigates the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors. We found that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV infection in vitro compared to Ad5-specific CD4 T cells in HVTN204 PBMC. The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analyses identified that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-1β) but little IL-17. Of interest, ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation, while Ad5 vector induced CD4 T-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. Our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.
 X inactivation is a process that occurs in female mammals, where one of the two X chromosomes is randomly silenced in each cell. This process is universal among therian mammals, but the specific X chromosome that is silenced varies among species. In marsupials, the paternally inherited X chromosome is always silenced, while in placental mammals, random X inactivation occurs. The evolution of this process is not well understood, but it is thought to be driven by selection for masking deleterious mutations. A theoretical population genetic analysis was conducted to examine how conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence the evolution of X inactivation strategies. The results indicate that random X inactivation is favored over paternal X inactivation as long as alleles are recessive and selection is sex-differential. The study provides a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes.
 Zinc-finger CCCH-type containing antiviral protein ( ZAP ) is a host factor that restricts the infection of many viruses mainly through RNA degradation , translation inhibition and innate immune responses . So far , only one flavivirus , yellow fever virus , has been reported to be ZAP-resistant . In this study, we investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP against three flaviviruses , Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) , dengue virus ( DENV ) and Zika virus ( ZIKV ) . We found that JEV infection was blocked by ZAP overexpression , and depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication . ZAP hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3′-5′ RNA exosome-mediated degradation . The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity . JEV 3′-UTR , especially in the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide , was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to ZAP . In summary , we identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus . ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection .
 Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) is a major human and animal pathogen associated with severe disease including hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis . RVFV is endemic to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but there is significant concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and the potentially devastating effect to livestock populations with concurrent infections of humans . To date, there is little detailed data directly comparing the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of RVFV and correlation with viral pathogenesis. Here we characterized clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type strain ZH501 or IND vaccine strain MP-12 in the C57BL/6 mouse. Animals infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. In contrast, ZH501 infection was lethal, caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong, systemic cytokine response which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology. Lymphopenia and platelet depletion were indicators of disease onset with indications of lymphocyte recovery correlating with increases in G-CSF production. RVFV is hepatotropic and in these studies significant clinical and histological data supported these findings; however, significant evidence of a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent. Rather, viral infection resulted in a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells, such as neutrophils, which was supported by histological data. In brains of ZH501 infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis. These data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with a loss of liver function due to liver necrosis and hepatitis yet the long-term course of disease for those that might survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature which is supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model.
 Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that is resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, the authors investigated the role of C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) in the chemoresistance of TNBC. They found that CCL20 was significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response. Furthermore, CCL20 promoted the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells ( BCSCs ) or breast cancer stem-like cells through protein kinase Cζ ( PKCζ ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) -mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) pathway, significantly increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. Moreover, CCL20-promoted NF-κB activation increased ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) /multidrug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) expression, leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane. These results suggested that chemotherapy-induced CCL20 mediated chemoresistance via up-regulating ABCB1. In addition, NF-κB activation increased CCL20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between NF-κB and CCL20 pathways, which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. The authors suggest that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients.
 Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that infects many warm-blooded animals, including humans. It is able to survive and replicate within host cells by secreting effector proteins that manipulate host cell functions. These effectors are transported across the parasite vacuole membrane (PVM) into the host cell. We have identified two new proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, that are required for the transport of effectors across the PVM. These proteins are membrane-associated and form a complex with MYR1, which is essential for effector transport. We also show that fusing an intrinsically disordered effector to a structured domain blocks its transport, consistent with a translocon model of effector transport. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of effector transport across the PVM and may lead to new strategies for treating toxoplasmosis.
Papillomaviruses (PVs) are a group of viruses that cause cancer in humans and animals. They have a small genome that is replicated by host DNA replication factors. The viral E2 protein binds to the viral origin of replication, which is a short DNA sequence that serves as a starting point for DNA replication. The E2 protein also binds to a protein called ORC2, which is a component of a complex that helps to prepare the origin of replication for DNA replication. In this study, the authors found that the E2 protein binds to ORC2, but that ORC2 is not present at the viral origin of replication. They also found that depleting ORC2 from cells increased the presence of E1 and E2 at the viral origin of replication. These results suggest that ORC2 helps to suppress viral replication, and that when ORC2 is depleted, E2 is able to bind to the origin of replication more efficiently, leading to increased viral replication.
Brucellosis is a common zoonotic disease that affects humans and livestock. The disease is caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella, which are transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or by consuming unpasteurized dairy products. The World Health Organization classifies brucellosis as a neglected zoonotic disease, and it is particularly prevalent in Central Asia. In this study, we investigated the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. We found that Brucella DNA was present in 10.3% of 564 cow milk samples using real-time PCR. This finding is concerning because consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region. Furthermore, we found that sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggests that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B. melitensis. These findings highlight the need for further investigation of brucellosis in the region and the importance of complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in brucellosis surveillance, control, and eradication programmes.
 The fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable and transcriptionally repressed. To understand the role of heterochromatin in genome stability, we deleted the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, kmt1 and kmt6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. We combined experimental evolution and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability, both in vitro and in planta. Analyses of genome and ChIP-seq data revealed dramatic chromatin reorganization in the absence of H3K9me3, where H3K27me3 is mostly relocalized into regions enriched with H3K9me3 in wild type. Many genome rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in the absence of H3K9me3, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions in vitro, even without large scale changes in gene activity. We conclude that H3K9me3 is important for the maintenance of genome stability because it disallows H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. In this system, H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, generating a “metastable” state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome.
 The study shows that a universal switch to intradermal (ID) delivery of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths. The study also presents financing mechanisms that would make PEP more affordable and accessible, and could even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs. The study concludes that prompt post-exposure prophylaxis is essential in preventing the fatal onset of disease in persons exposed to rabies, and that increasing accessibility, reducing costs, and preventing delays in delivery of PEP should therefore be prioritized. The study recommends a universal switch to ID delivery of PEP, which would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths. The study also presents financing mechanisms that would make PEP more affordable and accessible, and could even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs.
 Toxoplasma is an intracellular parasite that causes life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised individuals. It relies on lipid metabolic activities to produce infectious progeny and persist in its host. In this study, we found that host lipid droplets (LD) are important for Toxoplasma development in mammalian cells. We showed that Toxoplasma infection increases host LD formation, which correlates with reduced host microbicidal properties. We also provided morphological evidence that Toxoplasma internalizes host LD into the parasitophorous vacuole and salvages their lipid content for incorporation into membranes or storage in its own LD. Our findings suggest that Toxoplasma exploits host LD for nutritional purposes, which may be beneficial for a parasite that forages for lipids from many sources in the host cell.
 In this study, we searched for compounds that could inhibit the activity of two cysteine proteases from the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, which are responsible for causing fasciolosis in humans and livestock. We found that chalcones, a type of flavonoid, were effective inhibitors of these proteases. One of the compounds, C34, was particularly effective at inhibiting the juvenile-specific protease FhCL3, which is involved in the early stages of infection. We also found that C34 had fasciolicide activity, meaning it could kill the liver flukes in vitro. These findings suggest that chalcones could be used as a new class of drugs to treat fasciolosis.
 The visual system is responsible for analyzing the world around us and transmitting this information to the brain. In the retina, this information is processed through a series of spatio-temporal filters. Bipolar cells (BCs) are responsible for transmitting this information to the inner retina, but the exact mechanisms by which they do this are not well understood. In this study, the authors used in vivo imaging to investigate how BCs transmit this information. They found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters. Individual cells transmit through multiple terminals of varying sizes, but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. Smaller terminals also transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively. Modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to all these differences in response dynamics. These results indicate how one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties.
 We have developed a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex fluorescence microscopy (muxFM) image data. Our method accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as effectively as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and can reproduce known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. Our probabilistic synapse detector may also be useful for analysis of widely available confocal and super-resolution FM images.
 Zinc is a vital trace element that plays a crucial role in many physiological processes. ZnT2 is a zinc transporter that is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion into breast milk during lactation. The current study used computational modeling and experimental validation to determine the driving force of ZnT2. The results suggest that ZnT2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ion. This finding has important implications for our understanding of ZnT2 function and its role in lactation.
14-3-3 proteins are able to bind phosphorylated proteins and play an undefined role under DNA replication stress. Exo1 is a DNA repair nuclease that processes stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells. We now identify 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo1, both in yeast and mammalian cells. Yeast 14-3-3–deficient cells fail to induce Mec1–dependent Exo1 hyperphosphorylation and accumulate Exo1–dependent ssDNA gaps at stalled forks, as revealed by electron microscopy. This leads to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects. Moreover, using DNA bi-dimensional electrophoresis, we show that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. We propose that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress.
 We developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice . When pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection , the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) were abolished during acute HIV-1 infection with either a highly pathogenic CCR5/CXCR4-dual tropic HIV-1 or a standard CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate . Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I , HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice . Interestingly , the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice . During chronic HIV-1 infection , depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs , associated with elevated HIV-1 replication . Surprisingly , HIV-1 induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs , but not the blood , was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication . The increased cell number in lymphoid organs was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells . We conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis . These findings suggest that pDC-depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment .
Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural product found in cruciferous vegetables, blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages. HIV infection is a major health concern worldwide, and current treatments are limited by high costs, side effects, and the emergence of resistant viruses. SFN is a potent activator of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is involved in the antioxidant response. Nrf2 has been shown to be activated by several viruses, including Marburg virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and Dengue virus. However, the impact of SFN and Nrf2 on HIV infection in primary cells has not been determined. In this study, we show that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. We also found that SFN blocks infection after entry but before the formation of 2-LTR circles. Our results suggest that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlight a novel way to trigger this inhibition.
 Geohelminth infections are common in rural western Kenya, but risk factors and effects among pregnant women are not clear. In a community-based cross-sectional survey, pregnant women were interviewed and asked to provide a blood sample and a single fecal sample. Hemoglobin was measured and a blood slide examined for malaria. Geohelminth infections were identified using the concentration and Kato-Katz method. Among 390 participants who provided a stool sample, 76.2% were infected with at least one geohelminth species: 52.3% with Ascaris lumbricoides, 39.5% with hookworm, and 29% with Trichuris trichiura. Infection with at least one geohelminth species was associated with the use of an unprotected water source and the lack of treatment of drinking water. Geohelminth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or low body mass index. A hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid upper arm circumference. Hookworm infections with an egg count ≥1000/gram feces were associated with lower hemoglobin. Among gravidae 2 and 3, women with A . lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia compared to women without A . lumbricoides, unlike other gravidity groups. Geohelminth infections are common in this pregnant population; however, there were few observed detrimental effects. Routine provision of antihelminth treatment during an antenatal clinic visit is recommended, but in this area, an evaluation of the impact on pregnancy, malaria, and birth outcome is useful.
 Mycolactone is a macrolide produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans that has cytotoxic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of mycolactone on the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia. We found that mycolactone suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in these cells without affecting their viability. In vivo, mycolactone decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines in a rat model of neuropathic pain without inducing detectable cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may be partially explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.
 Human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) is a deadly disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. It is prevalent in West Africa, particularly in Guinea. The disease has a range of clinical outcomes, including acute, self-cured, and long-lasting infections. In this study, we investigated the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and HAT outcome in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea. We found that the IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease, while the MIF rs36086171 allele G seemed to be associated with an increased risk. The APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) was associated with a higher risk, and the APOL1 G1 polymorphism with a lower risk of developing HAT. No associations were found with other candidate genes. Our data show that host genes are involved in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea, with IL6 rs1818879 being associated with a lower risk of progressing to active HAT. These results enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and may lead to the development of new control tools.
1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) is a global effort to map the genetic diversity of human populations. The project has already sequenced more than 2,500 individuals from 20 populations worldwide. However, the project has not yet included any individuals from South Asia. To address this gap, the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP) was launched to sequence 38 healthy Singaporean Indians at a target coverage of 30X. The SSIP samples were found to be closely related to South Indians, but they also exhibited higher genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio than other Asian populations. The SSIP samples were also found to have higher European admixture than other Asian populations. The data resource for the SSIP samples is publicly available and is expected to serve as a valuable complement to the South Asian samples in Phase 3 of 1KGP.
 Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis. Melioidosis is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of the world and is considered an emerging disease in some areas. Treatment of melioidosis is complicated by the intrinsic resistance of B . pseudomallei to many antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and macrolides. In this study, the authors investigated the molecular mechanisms of aminoglycoside susceptibility exhibited by three Thai strains of B . pseudomallei. They found that two of the strains had greatly reduced levels of amrAB-oprA transcripts, while the third strain had completely lost the amrAB-oprA gene. The authors also found that the resistance of these strains was due to upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression by an unknown mechanism. The authors used a PCR walking strategy to reveal that the amrAB-oprA operon was missing in one of the strains and that this loss was associated with deletion of more than 70 kb of genetic material. The authors also found that despite missing several putative virulence genes, the strain was fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. The authors conclude that the strain may be a natural candidate for genetic manipulation experiments that use Select Agent compliant antibiotics for selection and validate the use of laboratory-constructed Δ ( amrAB-oprA ) mutants in such experiments.
 In this study, we explored the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper (Th) cells into Th1 versus Th2 states by counting single transcripts and quantifying immunofluorescence in individual cells. Contrary to mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, we observed their ubiquitous co-expression in individual cells at high levels that are distinct from basal-level co-expression during lineage priming. We observed that cytokines are expressed only in a small subpopulation of cells, independent from the expression of transcription factors in these single cells. This cell-to-cell variation in the cytokine expression during the early phase of T helper cell differentiation is significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. Upon inhibition of cytokine signaling, we observed the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, thus revealing a weak intracellular network otherwise overruled by the strong signals that emanate from extracellular cytokines. These results suggest that during the early differentiation process CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state, instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components unveiled in Th1/Th2 differentiation may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.
 The C . elegans PAQR-2 protein is a homolog of the insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors in mammals and is essential for adaptation to growth at 15°C, a low but usually acceptable temperature for this organism. By screening for novel paqr-2 suppressors, we identified mutations in genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. We then show genetic evidence that paqr-2, phosphatidylcholines, sbp-1, and Δ9-desaturases form a cold adaptation pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to retain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This model is supported by the observations that the paqr-2 suppressors normalize the levels of saturated fatty acids, and that low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity can rescue the paqr-2 mutant.
 Human herpes simplex virus type-1 ( HSV-1 ) is a well-characterized virus that causes a range of diseases from cold sores and chicken pox to congenital defects, blindness, and cancer. Despite extensive study, much remains to be learned about the structure of the genome packaging and release machinery in the capsids of these large and complex double-stranded DNA viruses. In this study, electron cryo-tomography of HSV-1 virions revealed a previously unsuspected feature at the portal vertex, which extends across the tegument layer to form a connection between the capsid and the viral membrane. The location of this assembly suggests that it plays a role in genome release into the nucleus and is also important for virion architecture.
The study investigates the effects of soluble egg antigen (SEA) from Schistosoma mansoni on modulating HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro. SEA, specifically through kappa-5, can potently bind to DC-SIGN and thereby blocks DC-SIGN mediated HIV-1 trans-infection (p<0.05) while not interfering with cis-infection. DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2 promoting conditions will upon co-culture with naïve T-cells induce a T-cell population that was less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection (p<0.05) compared to DCs unexposed to SEA, whereas HIV-1 X4 virus infection was unaffected. This was not observed for DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th1 or Th1/Th2 (Tmix) promoting conditions. All T-cell populations induced by SEA exposed DCs demonstrate a reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ and MIP-1β. The infection profile of T-cells infected with HIV-1 R5 was not associated with down-modulation of CCR5 cell surface expression. DCs maturing under Tmix conditions exposed to plant recombinant omega-1 protein (rω-1), which demonstrates similar functions to natural ω-1, induced T-cell populations that were less sensitive for HIV-1 R5 infection (p<0.05), but not for X4 virus infection. This inhibition associated again with a reduction in IFN-γ and MIP-1β expression, but additionally correlated with reduced CCR5 expression. The study has shown that SEA parasite antigens and more specifically rω-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity with the potential to influence disease course in co-infected individuals.
 The extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and astrocytes is known to shrink by about 30% when neurons are activated. This phenomenon is not yet fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the movement of ions and water across the astrocyte membrane. A mathematical model has been developed to explain the shrinkage phenomenon based on the actions of the Na/K/ATPase pump, passive ion transport, and osmotically driven water transport through the astrocyte membrane. The model was tested using a variety of wild-type and gene knockout or knockdown situations. The results suggest that the Na/K/ATPase pump, passive ion transport, and osmotically driven water transport through the astrocyte membrane are all important factors in the shrinkage phenomenon. The model can be used to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.
20–25-nt small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) are produced by the RNase III enzyme Dicer and provide sequence specificity for effector complexes mediating RNA cleavage and/or the establishment of chromatin modifications that silence transcriptional activity. In Arabidopsis thaliana , single-stranded RNA precursors for siRNA biogenesis are produced by RNA Polymerase II ( Pol II ) or RNA Polymerase IV ( Pol IV ) , while the second strand is synthesized by RDR2 ( RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 2 ) . DCL3 ( Dicer-like 3 ) cleaves double-stranded RNA into siRNAs that are then incorporated into ARGONAUTE4 ( AGO4 ) . This mechanism seems to be similar in maize where homologs of RDR2 and Pol IV have been shown to be involved in transcriptional gene silencing. In Arabidopsis , transcriptional silencing requires a specialized RNA Polymerase complex known as RNA Polymerase V ( Pol V ) . Pol V produces non-coding transcripts in otherwise silent chromatin, and its activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of repressive chromatin modifications. Pol V-produced non-coding transcripts physically interact with AGO4 and recruit siRNA-AGO4 complexes to their targets. In plants, siRNAs may recognize their targets by base-pair interactions with Pol V transcripts. SPT5L ( Suppressor of Ty insertion 5 - like; also known as SPT5-like or KTF1 ) is a homolog of SPT5 Pol II-associated elongation factor. It was shown to contain a domain rich in WG/GW repeats that facilitate physical interaction with AGO4. Because SPT5L interacts with RNA but is not required for the accumulation of Pol V-dependent transcripts, it was hypothesized to work downstream of Pol V and recruit AGO4 to Pol V-transcribed loci. Here we try to resolve the mechanism of siRNA-mediated recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes to chromatin and the function of SPT5L in this process. We show that SPT5L physically interacts with chromatin and that SPT5L works downstream of Pol V but does not require 24-nt siRNA. SPT5L and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and at least partially independently of each other and both are needed for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at several loci. We propose that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes.
 Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. The bacterium has three stages of development: larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymphal stage, the bacterium is transmitted to a mammalian host when the tick bites the host. The bacterium then enters the host's bloodstream and begins to multiply. The bacterium has a unique way of regulating its gene expression during the tick phase of its life cycle. The bacterium uses a protein called RpoS to regulate the expression of certain genes. In this study, the authors examined the role of RpoS in the tick phase of the bacterium's life cycle. They found that RpoS is required for the transmission of the bacterium from the tick to the mammalian host. The authors also found that the bacterium forms a unique morphology called round bodies when it is unable to produce enough energy to transmit to the mammalian host. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation in the tick phase of the bacterium's life cycle and its ability to transmit to the mammalian host.
 In this study, we investigated the relationship between gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) in controlling stamen development in Arabidopsis. We found that GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57. These three MYB genes are stamen-enriched and down-regulated in the GA-deficient quadruple mutant ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1. We also showed that the loss-of-function of two DELLAs RGA and RGL2 restores the expression of these three MYB genes together with restoration of stamen filament growth in GA-deficient plants. Our results suggest that GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, which are essential for stamen development.
 The TOR pathway is a conserved protein kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth factors. It has been shown to be essential for lifespan extension in flies and yeast, but its role in lifespan extension by dietary restriction (DR) in C. elegans is still unclear. In this study, we found that HIF-1, a transcription factor complex that plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response, modulates lifespan extension by DR in C. elegans. We also found that HIF-1 modulates lifespan extension in a nutrient-dependent manner and that its activity is associated with lower levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway.
The study investigates the role of transcription factor GRHL3 in regulating the differentiation and migration of human keratinocytes. The authors found that GRHL3 binds to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes and promoters in migrating keratinocytes. They also found that GRHL3 represses the formation of progenitor and non-keratinocyte super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes. The study provides insight into the mechanisms by which GRHL3 regulates differentiation and migration of keratinocytes.
 Retroviruses are a group of viruses that infect cells and integrate their genetic material into the host genome. This process is called endogenization and results in the formation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). ERVs are remnants of ancient retroviral infections of the host germline that are passed to subsequent generations like any other host gene. Some ERVs are transcriptionally active and have maintained intact open reading frames for some of their genes, raising the possibility that they may be beneficial to their hosts. One of the possible explanations for the selection of some ERVs in vertebrates is their ability to provide protection against infection of related exogenous pathogenic retroviruses. Sheep provide an interesting animal model system to study retrovirus-host coevolution in nature. The sheep genome harbors many copies of ERVs highly related to JSRV/ENTV that are termed enJSRVs. enJSRVs are abundantly expressed in the genital tract of the ewe, particularly in the endometrial lumenal and glandular epithelia of the uterus and in the trophectoderm of the placenta. Recently, we demonstrated that enJSRVs are critical for reproduction of sheep because inhibition of enJSRVs Env production in utero severely compromised trophectoderm growth and differentiation in the ovine placenta. In addition, we found that some enJSRVs interfere with the replication of JSRV in vitro both by receptor competition and, most interestingly, at late stages of the replication cycle (a mechanism termed JLR, meaning JSRV late restriction). JLR is exerted by a defective transdominant enJSRV provirus, enJS56A1, whose Gag protein associates with and blocks intracellular trafficking of the JSRV Gag. Our previous studies imply that sheep Betaretroviruses offer unique opportunities to study the coevolution of ERVs, exogenous retroviruses, and their hosts. Here, by characterizing the evolutionary history and molecular virology of enJSRVs, we provide data supporting a model of continuous coadaptation between retroviruses and their hosts. In particular, these studies determined that: (i) two enJSRV loci that entered the host genome before and during speciation within the genus Ovis, acquired in two temporally distinct events, the W21 residue in Gag conferring a transdominant blocking phenotype; (ii) both these transdominant enJSRVs loci became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication; (iii) the invasion of the sheep genome by ERVs of the JSRV/enJSRVs group is still in progress; and (iv) proviruses recently emerged that can escape the transdominant enJSRV loci. This study provides a unique outlook at the complex interplay between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses during host evolution.
 Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The current diagnosis of schistosomiasis relies on microscopic detection of schistosome eggs in stool or urine samples and serological assays. However, these methods have limitations, such as poor sensitivity and the inability to differentiate between ongoing and previous infections. Molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been developed to improve the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. In this study, two in-house real-time PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium were evaluated on excreta, biopsies, and sera. The results showed that PCRs significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis compared to microscopy, particularly in patients with negative microscopy results. PCRs also provided species information to guide further clinical exploration and could be useful for early treatment monitoring. Overall, the study demonstrated the potential of PCR as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of schistosomiasis.
 The study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning to estimate potential energy surfaces for large, complex molecules. The natural product Archazolid A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase, was used as an example. The model estimates energies of new conformations by exploiting information from previous calculations via Gaussian process regression. Predictive variance was used to assess whether a conformation is in the interpolation region, allowing a controlled trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed-up. For energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional level of theory, mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol were achieved. The study demonstrates that predictive machine learning models can be developed for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, potentially enabling considerable speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures.
 The study aimed to develop a non-invasive immunological assay to detect ebolavirus antibodies in great ape feces. The assay was successfully used to identify gorillas with antibodies to ebolavirus, with an overall prevalence rate reaching 10% on average. This suggests that ebolavirus exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to ebolavirus. The new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future ebolavirus infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically naïve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Finally, since human EVD is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EBOV causes case-fatality rates of up to 88%.
 The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a popular model organism for studying the nervous system. The connectome of C . elegans has been well characterized, but the functional design principles of the network remain unclear. In this study, we used computational network-vulnerability analysis to identify critical components of the C . elegans connectome. We found 12 critical neurons and 29 critical synapses that are required for the network to function properly. These critical components form circuit-level pathways that control information processing in the connectome. Our study provides insights into the fundamental architectural design of complex nervous systems and highlights the importance of integrative and serial design elements in the connectome.
 The RV254 cohort of HIV-infected individuals was used to study T helper- B cell responses in acute HIV infection and the impact of early antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) on T and B cell function . To investigate this, the function of circulating T follicular helper cells ( cTfh ) from this cohort was examined, and cTfh and memory B cell populations were phenotyped. Impaired cTfh cell function was observed in individuals treated in stage 3 when compared to stage 1/2 . The cTfh/B cell cocultures showed lower B cell survival and IgG secretion at stage 3 compared to stage 1/2 . This coincided with lower IL-10 and increased RANTES and TNF-α, suggesting a role for inflammation in altering cTfh and B cell responses. Elevated plasma viral load in stage 3 was found to correlate with decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production, indicating a role for increased viremia in cTfh impairment and dysfunctional humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were also evident in the mature B cell compartment, most notably a decrease in resting memory B cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with higher viremia. Our coculture assay also suggested that intrinsic memory B cell defects could contribute to the impaired response despite at a lower level. Overall, cTfh-mediated B cell responses are significantly altered in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with increased inflammation and a reduction in memory B cells. These data suggest that early ART for acutely HIV infected individuals could preserve immune dysregulation while preserving cTfh function and B cell memory.
 Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. The current treatment for schistosomiasis is praziquantel, which has several non-optimal features. To develop next generation anthelmintics, it is important to identify new drug targets. One approach is to profile flatworm G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are a class of receptors that are targeted by over a quarter of current human therapeutics. In this study, the authors pharmacologically profiled a schistosome serotonergic GPCR (Sm . 5HTR) that has been implicated as a downstream modulator of PZQ efficacy. They used a miniaturized screening assay that is compatible with high content screening and employs a split luciferase-based biosensor sensitive to cellular cAMP levels. The authors identified new ligands and compound series selective for Sm . 5HTR, and demonstrated conservation of an unusual antagonist-evoked inactivation mechanism for Sm . 5HTR. These findings suggest that Sm . 5HTR is a promising target for the development of next generation anthelmintics.
 The primordial organization of the metazoan body is achieved during gastrulation by the establishment of the germ layers. Adhesion differences between ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm cells could in principle be sufficient to maintain germ layer integrity and prevent intermixing. However, in organisms as diverse as fly, fish, or amphibian, the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary not only keeps these germ layers separated but the ectoderm also serves as substratum for mesoderm migration, and the boundary must be compatible with repeated cell attachment and detachment. We show that localized detachment resulting from contact-induced signals at the boundary is at the core of ectoderm-mesoderm segregation. Cells alternate between adhesion and detachment, and detachment requires ephrinB/EphB signaling. Multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary, and tissue separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary in both directions, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and RhoA. This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process of germ layer formation. Instead, it involves localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle which allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum.
 Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication and interaction difficulties, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests.  While the underlying causes of ASD are still unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  One potential contributor to ASD is dysfunction in the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration pathways.  In this study, the authors analyzed metabolite concentrations of these pathways in blood samples from 83 participants with ASD and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers.  Using Fisher Discriminant Analysis, the authors were able to distinguish participants with ASD from neurotypical peers with 96.1% accuracy.  Additionally, kernel partial least squares was used to predict adaptive behavior, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score, with an R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation.  These results suggest that dysfunction in the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration pathways may be associated with ASD and could potentially be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and severity prediction.  Overall, this study provides strong evidence for the association between these pathways and ASD and highlights the potential for using multivariate statistical analysis to extract important information from complex biochemical data sets.
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide. In Brazil, the disease is endemic and has been increasing in incidence over the past decade. To better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of leishmaniasis in Brazil, we used Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models to analyze reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis from 2001 to 2010. We identified precipitation and socioeconomic proxies as important risk factors for both types of leishmaniasis. Our risk maps predicted the highest numbers of infected people in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. These maps can be used to prioritize intervention areas and optimize resource allocation for control and elimination efforts.
 Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is rapidly spreading across the world. Infection with any of the four dengue viral serotypes can cause a range of symptoms, from mild viral illness to severe plasma leakage and shock. Recent studies have shown that adults are increasingly affected by dengue, with unusual complications such as acute liver failure, encephalopathy, myocarditis, and acute renal failure. In this study, we compared the clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcomes of 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue who were hospitalized at a single hospital in southern Vietnam. We found that adults had more severe signs of vascular leakage and shock, while bleeding manifestations and organ involvement were more common in children. Additionally, adults experienced significantly more severe thrombocytopenia. Secondary infection but not serotype was independently associated with greater thrombocytopenia, although with a smaller effect than age-group. The effect of age-group on platelet count was also apparent in the values obtained several weeks after recovery, indicating that healthy adults have intrinsically lower counts compared to children. Our study highlights the distinctions between adults and children in the pattern of complications seen in association with dengue infection, and these depend partly on intrinsic age-dependent physiological differences. This knowledge is important to inform research on disease pathogenesis and to encourage development of management guidelines that are appropriate to the age-groups at risk.
 In this study, we found that a novel mutation in the CCR5 gene of sooty mangabeys (SM) results in a lack of surface expression and coreceptor function. Despite this, SM are susceptible to natural and experimental infection with SIVsmm and exhibit robust viral replication. This is the first clear evidence for in vivo alternative coreceptor use by SIVsmm in its natural hosts. Our data suggests that cell targeting and tropism in SM is linked to expression and use of both CCR5 and additional alternative entry pathways. This is the third example of convergent evolution resulting in nonfunctional mutant CCR5 alleles among primate species.
MEF2 is a family of transcriptional regulators involved in the control of pleiotropic responses during development and adult life. In this study, we have explored the transcriptional landscape and the epigenetic modifications under the control of these TFs in relation to the tumorigenic process using leiomyosarcomas (LMS) as a model. We have shown that MEF2 can support both pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressive activities depending on the interaction with co-activators or co-repressors partners. In LMS, this two-faced trait of MEF2 is relevant for tumor aggressiveness. Class IIa HDACs are overexpressed in 22% of LMS, where high levels of MEF2, HDAC4 and HDAC9 inversely correlate with overall survival. The knock out of HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells by restoring the transcriptional proficiency of some MEF2-target loci. HDAC9 coordinates also the demethylation of H3K4me3 at the promoters of MEF2-target genes. Moreover, we have shown that class IIa HDACs do not bind all the regulative elements bound by MEF2. Hence, in a cell MEF2-target genes actively transcribed and strongly repressed can coexist. These repressed MEF2-targets are poised in terms of chromatin signature. Overall our results candidate class IIa HDACs and HDAC9 in particular, as druggable targets for a therapeutic intervention in LMS.
2D crystalline films of hydrophobins are important for fungal growth and have many industrial applications. We used protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy to study the surface structure of films composed of two class II hydrophobins, HFBI and HFBII, produced by Trichoderma reesei. Our results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins with P6 symmetry, but our cryo-EM results show a structure with only P3 symmetry. We also found a possible metastable structure with P3 symmetry and a smaller lattice size. Our results provide insight into the structure and properties of hydrophobin films and may have implications for their industrial applications.
 We have identified Threonyl tRNA synthetase ( ThrRS ) as a potential drug target in Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. We have characterized the enzyme activity of LdThrRS and found it to be essential for the survival of L. donovani. Borrelidin, a known inhibitor of ThrRS, was found to have antileishmanial activity and inhibited the aminoacylation activity of LdThrRS. Our study provides a platform for further exploration of LdThrRS as a potential target for drug discovery against visceral leishmaniasis.
 We have defined a multi-motif PAMP signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I that includes a 5′-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection. Our studies define a basis of non-self discrimination by RIG-I and offer insights into the antiviral therapeutic potential of targeted RIG-I signaling activation.
 Eosinophils are known to play a role in host defense and allergy, but recent studies have shown that they also have important functions in metabolism and tissue regeneration. In this study, the authors investigated the role of eosinophils in the growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. They found that IL-4 and eosinophils are necessary for normal larval growth and that eosinophils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth. The eosinophil-mediated effect operates in the absence of adaptive immunity. Following invasion by newborn larvae, host gene expression in skeletal muscle was compatible with a regenerative response and a shift in the source of energy in infected tissue. The presence of eosinophils suppressed local inflammation while also influencing nutrient homeostasis in muscle. These findings suggest that eosinophils promote larval growth by an IL-4 dependent mechanism that limits local interferon-driven responses that otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle.
 In this study, the authors report a quantitative genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in several human cell types. They found that DNA replication origins are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire as small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase. Replication fork velocity remains constant and narrowly distributed through S phase. However, multi-scale analysis of a genome-wide replication timing profile shows a broad distribution of replication timing gradients with practically no regions larger than 100 kb replicating at less than 2 kb/min. Therefore, HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression. The authors suggest that origins fire independently of each other but under the control of long-range chromatin structure, or that replication forks progressing from early origins stimulate initiation in nearby unreplicated DNA. These findings shed a new light on the replication timing program of mammalian genomes and provide a general model for their replication kinetics.
 Our nervous system is able to recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting conditions. This ability is thought to be due to the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise. In this study, we explore how this "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach can be implemented within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. We first show that slow feature analysis (SFA), an algorithm based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons using a modified Hebbian learning rule. We then show analytically that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window. By studying the learning dynamics of STDP, we show that for functional interpretations of STDP, it is not the learning window alone that is relevant but rather the convolution of the learning window with the postsynaptic potential. We then derive STDP learning windows that implement slow feature analysis and the "trace rule." The resulting learning windows are compatible with physiological data both in shape and timescale. Moreover, our analysis shows that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics, respectively. The theory indicates that irreversible input statistics are not in favor of stable weight distributions but may generate oscillatory weight dynamics. Our analysis offers a novel interpretation for the functional role of STDP in physiological neurons.
 We have discovered a new phenomenon in heterogeneous tumors called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cancer cells when exposed to cancer therapy. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer phenotypically diverse non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by conferring mutations in Dicer1, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. We monitored three-dimensional growth dynamics of fluorescently-labeled mutant and/or wild-type cells individually or in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. By integrating mathematical modeling with flow cytometry, we characterized the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra- and interspecies competition. We found that the combination of WT and mutants in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug sensitive cells despite drug pressure via induction of cell state transitions described by a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values. Finally, we used an ex vivo human tumor model that predicts clinical response through drug sensitivity analyses and determined that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates to prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. Together, these findings present a new paradox in drug resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells to thwart drug pressure, suggesting that profiling for druggable targets alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy.
Rickettsioses are a group of bacterial infections that are transmitted by ticks and other arthropods. They are common in sub-Saharan Africa, but the burden of disease, risk factors, and transmission are not well understood. In this study, we used data from a population-based cohort study in Mbeya, Tanzania to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae and to assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. We found that SFG-seropositivity was 67.9% and that it was associated with age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density. At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence. These findings suggest that SFG rickettsial infection is common in the more rural population of Mbeya Region and that spread is further limited by temperature and higher elevation. Examination of the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses seems warranted in a prospective study to estimate the disease burden in the population. This will also allow determination of the causative pathogens.
 Fatty acids play a crucial role in many physiological processes, including the formation of membranes and energy storage. In this study, we uncover a role for the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. From an RNAi screen for regulators of innate immune defense genes, we identified the two stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturases that synthesize oleate in C . elegans. We show that the synthesis of oleate is necessary for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune defense genes. Accordingly, C . elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous oleate. However, oleate is not sufficient to drive protective immune activation. Together, these data add to the known health-promoting effects of monounsaturated fatty acids and suggest an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection.
 The study presents a new class of antibiotics that target riboswitches, which are regulatory elements that control gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding. The study focuses on guanine riboswitches, which are involved in the regulation of transport and biosynthesis of purine metabolites. The study shows that a pyrimidine compound, PC1, binds to guanine riboswitches and exhibits bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including well-known nosocomial pathogens. The study also shows that PC1 targets a different metabolic pathway and that it is effective against multiple drug-resistant strains. The study uses a mouse model to show a direct correlation between the administration of PC1 and the reduction of Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands. The study establishes the possibility of using existing structural knowledge to design novel guanine riboswitch-targeting antibiotics as powerful and selective antimicrobial compounds.
 We used virtual reality to study how gaze informs the construction of mental space during wayfinding in macaque monkeys. We found that hippocampal cells in monkeys encode the animal's logical situation within a set of actions leading to the goal, and that this encoding is influenced by the target of gaze. Our findings suggest that counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, therein supporting self-awareness in the construction of space.
 We present a computational analysis of the spatial gene expression patterns at the mid-hindbrain boundary ( MHB ) of the mouse embryo. We use a Boolean approach to infer regulatory interactions between the genes Otx2 , Gbx2 , Fgf8 , Wnt1 , En1/En2 , and Pax2/5 . Our analysis predicts that Fgf8 and Wnt1 signaling are dependent on each other for stable maintenance, but Fgf8 is not sufficient to ectopically induce Wnt1 expression. We validate this prediction experimentally by performing a time-course analysis of Wnt1 expression after Fgf8-bead implantation into mouse anterior neural plate/tube explants. Our analysis clarifies epistatic relationships at the MHB, especially between the two key patterning molecules Fgf8 and Wnt1. We also construct spatial models that are able to explain the stable maintenance of the characteristic gene expression patterns at the MHB. These patterns are the result of a refinement and sharpening of initially blurred expression domains. Our models are competent to simulate this process and reproduce the phenotypes of various loss-of-function experiments even in a correct spatio-temporal order. We conclude with a robustness analysis of our models.
 Theileria annulata is a parasite that causes a disease called tropical theileriosis in cattle. The parasite transforms host cells, causing them to divide uncontrollably. The parasite interacts with host cell microtubules (MTs) to ensure its distribution between daughter cells during cell division. We found that a protein called p104, which is expressed on the surface of the parasite, binds to a protein called EB1, which is a key regulator of MT dynamics. This interaction is mediated by a specific motif in p104. Our findings provide new insight into the mode of interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton.
DNA damage is a common occurrence during normal cell division, and cells have developed mechanisms to repair such damage. One such mechanism is homologous recombination (HR), which involves the exchange of genetic information between two homologous DNA molecules. In this study, the authors found that a protein called Pif1 plays a crucial role in HR by promoting the exchange of genetic information between two homologous DNA molecules. They also found that Pif1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, and this phosphorylation is important for its function in HR. The authors propose a model whereby the passage of HR forks through telomeres promotes telomere lengthening. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of HR and its role in maintaining genome stability.
 Onchocerciasis is a debilitating disease caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus . It is a major public health concern in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The current diagnostic tools for onchocerciasis are not ideal, as they are invasive, time-consuming, and lack sensitivity. In this study, we investigated the use of luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) as a more rapid, specific, and standardized diagnostic assay for onchocerciasis. Four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens were tested by LIPS on a large cohort of blinded sera comprised of both uninfected controls and patients with a proven parasitic infection including Onchocerca volvulus (Ov), Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb), Loa loa (Ll), Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss), and with other potentially cross-reactive infections. In addition to testing all four Ov antigens separately, a mixture that tested all four antigens simultaneously was evaluated in the standard 2-hour incubation format as well as in a 15-minute rapid LIPS format. Antibody responses to the four different Ov antigens allowed for unequivocal differentiation between Ov-infected and uninfected control sera with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Analysis of the antibody titers to each of these four antigens in individual Ov-infected sera revealed that they were markedly different and did not correlate (rS = –0.11 to 0.58; P = 0.001 to 0.89) to each other. Compared to Ov-infected sera, patients infected with Wb, Ll, Ss, and other conditions had markedly lower geometric mean antibody titers to each of the Ov 4 antigens (P<0.0002 for each antigen). The simplified method of using a mixture of the 4 Ov antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format (QLIPS) showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing the Ov-infected sera from the uninfected control sera. Finally, the QLIPS format had the best performance with 100% sensitivity and specificity values of 76%, 84%, and 93% for distinguishing Ov from Wb, Ll, and Ss-infected sera, respectively. The multi-antigen LIPS assay can be used as a rapid, high throughput, and specific tool to not only to diagnose individual Ov infections but also as a sensitive and potentially point-of-care method for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Ov infection.
 The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is a large-scale effort to identify and characterize functional elements in the human genome. The project involves multiple technologies and approaches, including chromatin immunoprecipitation, DNA methylation analysis, and RNA sequencing. The ENCODE Consortium, comprising 27 institutions, is working to generate high-quality data and develop novel algorithms to facilitate analysis. The data and derived results are made available through a freely accessible database. The project has identified several classes of functional elements, including genes, transcripts, and transcriptional regulatory regions, as well as DNA binding proteins that interact with regulatory regions in the genome. The ENCODE Project has also developed standards to ensure high-quality, reproducible data and has placed an emphasis on data quality, including ongoing development and application of standards for data reproducibility and the collection of associated experimental information. The Consortium has prioritized the analysis of selected sets of cell types, including two widely studied immortalized cell lines, an EBV-immortalized B-lymphoblastoid line, and the H1 human embryonic stem cell line, as well as more than 100 cell types that are being analyzed in selected assays. The ENCODE Project aims to provide the scientific and medical communities with high-quality, comprehensive annotations of candidate functional elements in the human genome, which will enable the interpretation of the human genome and improve health.
 Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a common human virus that causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with various cancers. EBV evades the host immune system by downregulating its antigen expression during the latent phase of infection and by producing immune evasion proteins during the replicative phase. In this study, the authors identified a new immune evasion protein, gp150, which is expressed during the late phase of infection and interferes with antigen presentation by HLA I, II, and CD1d molecules. The authors provide evidence that gp150 shields the recognition of these surface molecules in a glycan-dependent manner. This represents a novel immune evasion mechanism in herpesviruses.
 The translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein ( Tarp ) is a conserved protein among all pathogenic chlamydial species . Previous studies have identified the actin binding and proline rich domains of Tarp as essential for Tarp-mediated actin nucleation . In this study, we examined the actin binding domains of Tarp orthologs from different chlamydial species and found that they all promote actin nucleation. We also generated a peptide antiserum specific for the Tarp actin binding domain and found that it inhibited actin polymerization in vitro and chlamydial entry in vivo. Our findings suggest that Tarp-mediated actin polymerization is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and plays an important role in bacterial entry.
 Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis with a number of mammalian species acting as reservoir hosts, including water buffaloes which can contribute up to 75% to human transmission in the People's Republic of China. Determining prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma japonicum in mammalian hosts is important for calculating transmission rates and determining environmental contamination. A new procedure, the formalin–ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA–SD) technique, for increased visualization of S. japonicum eggs in bovine feces is described. The procedure involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy. Bulk debris, including the dense cellulosic material present in bovine feces, often obscures schistosome eggs with the result that prevalence and infection intensity based on direct visualization cannot be made accurately. This technique removes nearly 70% of debris from the fecal samples and renders the remaining debris translucent. It allows improved microscopic visualization of S. japonicum eggs and provides an accurate quantitative method for the estimation of infection in bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts. The FEA-SD technique could be of considerable value if applied as a surveillance tool for animal reservoirs of S. japonicum, particularly in areas with low to high infection intensity, or where, following control efforts, there is suspected elimination of schistosomiasis japonica.
 Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ) is a genetic disorder characterized by low bone mass, bone deformities, and joint laxity. It is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the synthesis and processing of collagen, the main component of bone. In particular, mutations in the genes encoding cartilage associated protein ( CRTAP ) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 ( P3H1 ) have been identified as the first causes of recessive OI. These proteins, together with cyclophilin B ( encoded by PPIB ), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the α1 ( I ) chain ( Pro986 ) and has cis/trans isomerase ( PPIase ) activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for the structural stability of collagen; however, the absence of this post-translational modification may disrupt protein-protein interactions integral for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen over-modification. To distinguish between these functions, we generated knock-in mice carrying a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of P3h1 ( Lepre1H662A ). This substitution abolished P3h1 activity but retained ability to form a complex with Crtap and thus the collagen chaperone function. Knock-in mice showed absence of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the α1 ( I ) and α1 ( II ) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They were normal in appearance, had no growth defects and normal cartilage growth plate histology but showed decreased trabecular bone mass. This new mouse model recapitulates elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth phenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Our observations suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex.
 The P-element is a type of transposable element that was horizontally transferred from a distantly related species into Drosophila melanogaster . Despite causing ‘hybrid dysgenesis’ , a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes that include sterility , the P-element spread globally in the course of a few decades in D . melanogaster . Until recently , its sister species , including D . simulans , remained P-element free . Here , we find a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in the offspring of crosses between D . simulans strains collected in different years; a survey of 181 strains shows that around 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis . Using genomic and transcriptomic data , we show that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element . To characterize this invasion temporally and geographically , we survey 631 D . simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element . We find that the D . simulans P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed , with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014 . Importantly , as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype , strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element .
 We report on the adaptation of a rhodamine B marking technique for male Aedes aegypti to allow for rapid assessment of competitiveness ( mating success ) during field releases. Rhodamine B marking is a potentially useful evaluation method for male-based sterile insect technique ( SIT ) control strategies as well as a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments without the negative side-effects of traditional marking methods. We report on a series of experiments with the goals of determining optimal feeding regimes for ideal body and seminal fluid marking, as well as any potential impacts of rhodamine B feeding on male survival and male mating competitiveness. We conclude by presenting results from proof-of-principle field releases.
 Superantigens are a family of toxins produced by certain bacteria that can cause severe inflammatory responses and even death in humans. These toxins bind directly to T cells and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) molecules on antigen-presenting cells, bypassing the need for conventional antigen presentation. This allows superantigens to activate a large number of T cells, resulting in massive cytokine production and inflammation. In this study, we found that superantigens must bind directly to the dimer interface of CD28, a costimulatory receptor expressed on T cells, to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity. We also found that preventing access of superantigens to CD28 is sufficient to block their lethality. Our findings suggest that CD28 is a critical receptor target for superantigen toxins and reveal a novel role for CD28 in pathogen recognition.
 The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is important for the development and maintenance of pluripotent stem cells. In this study, the authors found that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls the cell cycle of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by regulating the expression of cell cycle inhibitors. They showed that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces the expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as p16Ink4a and p19Arf, leading to a reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in the number of cells in G1. The authors also found that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates the expression of pluripotency genes, but not differentiation genes. They showed that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway recruits the transcription factor Tcf1 to the promoters of cell cycle genes, such as the Ink4/Arf locus, leading to an increased expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle. The authors concluded that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls the cell cycle of mESCs by regulating the expression of cell cycle inhibitors.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a major public health problem in tropical countries, causing a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal features. In this study, we aimed to characterize the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in dengue patients and their function under DENV-2 stimulation in vitro. We found that pDCs of mild dengue patients exhibit significantly higher frequencies of membrane TRAIL compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IFN-α and soluble TRAIL are increased in mild compared to severe dengue patients, positively correlating with pDC activation. In vitro experiments showed that DENV-2 induced mTRAIL relocalization and IFN-α production by pDC. Furthermore, we found that pDC effect on viral load reduction was mainly dependent on IFN-α production. Thus, we propose that TRAIL-expressing pDCs may have an important role in the outcome of disease.
 The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection is complex and involves various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ). TNF plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis ( TB ), in accordance with animal studies. The present study takes a computational approach toward characterizing the role of TNF in protection against the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection. We extend our previous mathematical models to investigate the roles and production of soluble ( sTNF ) and transmembrane TNF ( tmTNF ). We analyze effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual clinical trials ( VCTs ) by simulating two of the most commonly used therapies, anti-TNF antibody and TNF receptor fusion, predicting mechanisms that explain observed differences in TB reactivation rates. The major findings from this study are that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for causing reactivation of latent infection and that sTNF—even at very low levels—is essential for control of infection. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish mechanisms of action of the anti-TNF treatments and gain insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology. Our study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed that could balance the requirement for reduction of inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified. Anti-TNF therapy will likely lead to numerous incidents of primary TB if used in areas where exposure is likely.
1000 Genomes Project revealed 208 retroduplication variations (RDVs) in human genomes. In this study, we investigated the variation in loss of ancestral (shared with other primates) retrocopies among different human populations. We also examined retrocopy expression levels using RNA-Seq data and detected 193 RDVs. Most of these RDVs resulted from retrocopy deletion. We experimentally confirmed the expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes that underwent deletion in certain individuals. The frequency of their deletion, with the exception of one retrogene, is very low. The expression, conservation and low rate of deletion of the remaining 10 retrocopies may suggest some functionality. We also searched for differences in retrocopy expression levels between populations and found 9 retrogenes that undergo statistically significant differential expression.
 Neurocysticercosis ( NCC ) is a disease caused by the larval stage of the parasitic helminth Taenia solium, which infects the central nervous system ( CNS ) of humans and pigs. The inflammatory response to cysticerci varies depending on their location and the extent of the parasite's degeneration. This study compared the inflammatory response to cysticerci located in the parenchyma, meninges, or both tissues in naturally infected pigs. The results showed that cysticerci located in the parenchyma elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response after anthelmintic treatment compared to those located in the meninges or both tissues. The study suggests that the suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs may be the reason subarachnoid NCC is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal NCC.
Yaws is a re-emerging endemic treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue. Azithromycin is the cornerstone of the WHO yaws eradication campaign. However, there is a possibility that resistance may have emerged in T. pallidum pertenue or that alternative infections may be responsible for some of the reported cases. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in thirty communities in two districts of Ghana where MDA for trachoma had previously been conducted. Children aged 5–17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled. Samples for treponemal serology and lesion PCR were collected from all children. We found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities. H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic testing into both pre and post-MDA surveillance systems is required to better inform yaws control programmes.
 We have shown that two FDA-approved drugs, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, can block the seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir in vitro. These drugs target the Jak-STAT pathway, which is involved in regulating homeostasis of memory T cells, the major hub of the HIV reservoir. We have also shown that these drugs can block viral production from infected cells and inhibit γ-C receptor cytokine (IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15)-induced viral reactivation from latent stores. These results suggest that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with HIV persistence and that Jak inhibitors may be integrated into future curative strategies.
 Baculoviruses are large DNA viruses that infect arthropods, mainly insects from the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. During their replication cycle, they produce two distinct morphological forms, the occlusion-derived virus that is responsible for transmission of the infection between insects and the budded virus that is responsible for spreading the infection within one insect host. In this study, we used microarray analysis to determine genes differentially expressed in S. exigua cells challenged with the species-specific baculovirus SeMNPV as well as with a generalist baculovirus, AcMNPV. We found that, in contrast to the host transcriptional shut-off that is expected during baculovirus infection, S. exigua cells showed a balanced number of up- and down-regulated genes during the first 36 hours following the infection. Many immune-related genes, including pattern recognition proteins, genes involved in signalling and immune pathways, as well as immune effectors and genes coding for proteins involved in the melanization cascade were found to be down-regulated after baculovirus infection. The down-regulation of immune-related genes was confirmed in the larval gut. We also observed an increase in the gut bacterial load following baculovirus infection. We hypothesize this to be a consequence of viral infection. Subsequent experiments on virus performance in the presence and absence of gut microbiota revealed that gut bacteria enhanced baculovirus virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion. We discuss the host immune response processes and pathways affected by baculoviruses, as well as the role of gut microbiota in viral infection.
 We have identified a novel gene that controls entry into the second meiotic division in Arabidopsis thaliana . By combining a mutation in this gene with two others that affect key meiotic processes, we created a genotype called MiMe in which meiosis is totally replaced by mitosis . The obtained plants produce functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to their mother . This is an important step towards understanding and engineering apomixis .
 The current study is the first large-scale assessment of the contribution of tissue-specific information to gene prioritization. By integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with protein interaction information, the authors construct tissue-specific protein-protein interaction networks for 60 tissues and investigate their prioritization power. They find that tissue-specific PPI networks considerably improve the prioritization results compared to those obtained using a generic PPI network. Furthermore, they allow predicting novel disease-tissue associations, pointing to sub-clinical tissue effects that may escape early detection. The authors conclude that incorporating tissue-specific information into the prioritization process is likely to yield more accurate results.
 Insecticide resistance is a major concern in the fight against malaria, a disease that kills over 400,000 people each year. Insecticide resistance occurs when mosquitoes develop mutations that allow them to survive exposure to insecticides. This can happen when insecticides are used in the same way over and over again. To combat this, researchers have developed a model to help determine the best way to use insecticides to minimize the spread of resistance. The model takes into account the exposure of males and females to different concentrations of insecticides and the selection pressures and dominance values of different concentrations. The model was used to investigate the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture. The results showed that both strategies can last more than 500 mosquito generations, but in those runs where resistance had spread to high levels by 500 generations, 56% favoured sequential use and 44% favoured mixtures. Mixtures are favoured when insecticide effectiveness ( their ability to kill homozygous susceptible genotypes ) is high and exposure ( the proportion of mosquitoes that encounter the insecticide ) is low. If insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous sensitive genotypes, it is likely that sequential deployment will be a more robust strategy. The model provides a flexible framework for investigating the spread of insecticide resistance in vector populations and identifying vector control strategies most likely to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance.
 Blood-sucking insects, such as triatomines, have evolved complex mechanisms to counteract host responses during feeding. These mechanisms include the release of bioactive molecules from their saliva, which can have therapeutic potential. In this study, next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry were used to investigate the salivary transcriptome of Rhodnius neglectus, a kissing bug that acts as a vector of Chagas disease. The study identified 73 putative secretory proteins, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5. The data presented in this study can improve our understanding of hematophagy and the complex interplay among vectors and their vertebrate hosts, and aid in the development of new therapeutic molecules.
In this study, we used transcriptional profiling to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to different bacterial environments in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . We then used mutations to inactivate these genes and showed that many of them contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment . We also found that the degree of differential gene expression between two bacterial environments predicted the magnitude of the effect of the loss of gene function on life history traits in those environments . Our results suggest that examination of differential gene expression in different environments can be informative about the relative contributions to function, at least for life history traits.
 The blastocyst is a critical stage in mammalian embryo development where the inner cell mass ( ICM ) and trophoectoderm ( TE ) are formed. The ICM gives rise to the embryo proper, while the TE forms the placenta. The formation of these structures is a dynamic process that involves cell movements, cell-cell interactions, and gene expression. In this study, the authors developed a computational model to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of the ICM and TE. The model incorporates stochastic effects, such as gene expression noise, and takes into account the physical structure of the embryo. The authors used quantitative imaging data to test the predictions of the model and found that noise-mediated plasticity plays a critical role in organizing the blastocyst. The authors also found that asymmetries in gene expression noise can promote plasticity while ameliorating the potentially detrimental effects of stochasticity. These results suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst.
 The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that work together to protect the body from foreign invaders. One of the key players in this network are antibodies, which are proteins that bind to specific molecules on the surface of pathogens and help to neutralize them. The ability of antibodies to bind to a wide range of different molecules is thought to be due to their inherent flexibility, which allows them to adapt to different binding partners. In this study, the authors used computational methods to design antibodies that could bind to multiple different molecules at once. They found that the antibodies they designed were more flexible than mature antibodies, and that this flexibility was important for their ability to bind to multiple different molecules. The authors suggest that this flexibility is an important feature of antibodies that allows them to adapt to a wide range of different pathogens.
The study of locust behavior has been a topic of interest for many years, as these insects can form destructive swarms that can devastate crops and vegetation. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical model to describe the phase change of locusts from solitary to gregarious behavior. They found that the phase change is driven by the interactions between locusts and that the critical density at which the phase change occurs depends on the behavioral parameters of the individual locusts. The authors also found that the final ratio of gregarious to solitary locusts is determined by the behavioral parameters of the individual locusts. Their model also exhibits population-level hysteresis, which has implications for locust management.
 Viral membrane fusion is a critical step in the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. The fusion process is driven by conformational changes of viral envelope glycoproteins, which are triggered by specific stimuli such as acidic pH or receptor interactions. Here, we used tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) as a model to study the fusion process of class II flaviviruses. We found that exposure of TBEV virions to alkaline pH traps the particles in an intermediate conformation in which the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. Our data provide important new insights into the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.
 The rapid and accelerating loss of biodiversity is a significant ecological challenge. Present-day rates of extinction are several orders of magnitude greater than background rates and are projected to increase further if current trends continue. In vertebrates, species traits such as body size, fecundity, and geographic range are important predictors of vulnerability. However, our knowledge of plant extinctions and vulnerabilities is lagging. Here, we disentangle the underlying drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot. By comparing Red List data for the British and South African floras, we demonstrate that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between regions, inconsistent with a simple trait-based model of extinction. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape, we reveal a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinction risks but show that the most threatened species cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny—opposite to trends in mammals. From analyzing the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades, we suggest that mode of speciation best explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. Our results have important implications for conservation priorities and cast doubts on the utility of current Red List criteria for plants in regions such as the Cape, where speciation has been rapid, if our aim is to maximize the preservation of the tree-of-life.
 The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogens. Dectin-1 is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes fungal β-glucan and plays a crucial role in anti-fungal immunity. In this study, two new interactors of Dectin-1, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1, were identified in macrophages. BTK and Vav1 are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C . albicans yeasts or hyphae but are absent from mature phagosomes. BTK and Vav1 localize to cuff regions surrounding the hyphae, while Dectin-1 lines the full length of the phagosome. BTK and Vav1 colocalize with the lipid PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 and F-actin at the phagocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol ( DAG ) which marks more mature phagosomal membranes. Using a selective BTK inhibitor, it was shown that BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in both zymosan and C . albicans phagocytosis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages that lack BTK or Vav1 show reduced uptake of C . albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C . albicans infection than wild type mice. This work identifies an important role for BTK and Vav1 in immune responses against C . albicans.
 Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans . Madagascar was heavily affected by RVF in 2008–2009 , with evidence of a large and heterogeneous spread of the disease . The identification of at-risk environments is essential to optimize the available resources by targeting RVF surveillance in Madagascar . Herein , the objectives of our study were: ( i ) to identify the environmental factors and areas favorable to RVFV transmission to both cattle and human and ( ii ) to identify human behaviors favoring human infections in Malagasy contexts . First , we characterized the environments of Malagasy communes using a Multiple Factor Analysis ( MFA ) . Then , we analyzed cattle and human serological data collected at national level using Generalized Linear Mixed Models , with the individual serological status ( cattle or human ) as the response , and MFA factors , as well as other potential risk factors ( cattle density , human behavior ) as explanatory variables. Cattle and human seroprevalence rates were positively associated to humid environments ( p<0 . 001 ) . Areas with high cattle density were at risk ( p<0 . 01; OR = 2 . 6 ) . Furthermore , our analysis showed that frequent contact with raw milk contributed to explain human infection ( OR = 1 . 6 ) . Finally , our study highlighted the eastern-coast , western and north-western parts as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle . Our integrated approach analyzing environmental , cattle and human datasets allow us to bring new insight on RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar . The association between cattle seroprevalence , humid environments and high cattle density suggests that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintain RVF enzootic transmission . Additionally , in the at-risk humid environment of the western , north-western and the eastern-coast areas , suitable to Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes , vectorial transmission probably occurs in both cattle and human . The relative contribution of vectorial or direct transmissions could be further assessed by mathematic modelling .
 Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that can be transmitted between non-identical proteins. Transmission barriers are attributed to sequence differences in prion proteins, but their underlying mechanisms are not clear. We used a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based experimental system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. We found that Rnq1 encompasses multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. Subsequent analysis of [PIN+] transmission between Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants established that (i) one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for the transmission; (ii) despite identical sequences of the common QNs, such transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. Existence of transmission barriers in the absence of amino acid mismatches in transmitting regions indicates that in complex prion domains multiple prion determinants act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, and reveals transmission barriers determined by this cooperative fold.
 We present a novel deep learning framework for population genetic inference. Our method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection, without sequential steps for these two factors. We apply our method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer both their overall demography and regions of their genome under selection. We find many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, and fewer under selection on standing variation or balancing selection. Interestingly, we find that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. In addition, our demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme. Our deep learning method is a powerful tool for population genetic inference and learning informative features of data.
HPV oncogenes E6/E7 are known to cause genomic instability and increase sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. In this study, we found that HPV E6/E7 attenuate the FA DNA crosslink repair pathway by inhibiting the completion of the repair process. E6/E7 impaired FancD2 colocalization with double-strand breaks, which subsequently hindered the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSB in E6 cells. Further, E6 expression caused delayed FancD2 deubiquitination, an important process for effective ICL repair. E6 mediated p53 degradation did not hamper the cell cycle specific process of FancD2 modifications but abrogated repair by disrupting FancD2 deubiquitination. These findings uncover unique mechanisms by which HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies.
 Onchocerciasis is a disease caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by black flies. In Mexico, the Southern Chiapas focus was the largest onchocerciasis focus in Latin America. Since 1998, the focus has undergone semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin. In 2003, 50 communities shifted from twice to four times a year, and 113 communities were added to the quarterly treatment regimen in 2009. In-depth epidemiological and entomological assessments were conducted in six sentinel communities and three extra-sentinel communities. None of the 67,924 Simulium ochraceum s. l. collected from this focus during the dry season of 2011 were found to contain parasite DNA when tested by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA), resulting in an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95%-ULCI) of the infective rate in the vectors of 0.06/2,000 flies examined. Serological assays testing for Onchocerca volvulus exposure conducted on 4,230 children 5 years of age and under (of a total population of 10,280 in this age group) revealed that 2/4,230 individuals were exposed to O. volvulus (0.05%; one sided 95% confidence interval=0.08%). The in-depth epidemiological and entomological findings from the Southern Chiapas focus meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community.
 Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes foodborne illnesses in humans. It is able to survive in soil and can become an intracellular pathogen following ingestion by mammals. The bacterium uses a number of virulence factors to gain entry into host cells, escape from host cell vacuoles, replicate within the cytosol, and spread to infect adjacent cells. The central virulence regulatory protein, PrfA, is a transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of many virulence genes. PrfA activation occurs following bacterial entry into host cells, but the identity of the small molecule cofactor that triggers PrfA activation has not yet been determined. In this study, the authors have identified a lipoprotein, PplA, that is secreted by L. monocytogenes and that shares homology with a peptide pheromone-encoding lipoprotein in E. faecalis. The authors have shown that PplA is required for L. monocytogenes virulence and that it may help the bacterium sense its presence within the confines of the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of virulence genes.
 Vibrio cholerae is a bacterium that causes cholera, a severe diarrheal disease. To survive in the harsh environment of the human intestine, V. cholerae has developed a number of adaptations, including the ability to cope with oxidative stress. In this study, we used a genetic approach to identify genes that are important for V. cholerae to survive in the host intestine. We found that a gene called mutS is important for V. cholerae to survive in the host intestine, especially in the presence of oxidative stress. MutS is involved in a process called mismatch repair, which helps to repair errors that occur during DNA replication. We also found that mutations in genes that produce an enzyme called catalase, which helps to break down hydrogen peroxide, and genes that produce a type of protein called rugose variants, which help V. cholerae to form biofilms, are important for V. cholerae to survive in the host intestine. These findings suggest that V. cholerae uses a combination of adaptations to survive in the host intestine, and that these adaptations are important for the bacterium to cause disease.
 Mlh1-Mlh3 is a protein complex that plays a role in both meiosis and mismatch repair (MMR). In meiosis, Mlh1-Mlh3 is involved in the resolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJs) into crossovers (COs) and noncrossovers (NCOs). In MMR, Mlh1-Mlh3 is involved in the recognition and repair of mismatched DNA.  To understand the function of Mlh1-Mlh3 in both meiosis and MMR, the authors analyzed 60 new mlh3 alleles in baker’s yeast. They found that five alleles specifically disrupted MMR, while one (mlh3-32) specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. The authors also constructed whole genome recombination maps for wild-type and MMR+ crossover- , MMR- crossover+ , endonuclease defective and null mlh3 mutants in an S288c/YJM789 hybrid background.  The authors observed an increase in the number of noncrossover events in all of the mlh3 mutants, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative recombination pathways. They also found that Mlh1-Mlh3 is an endonuclease that nicks circular duplex DNA in vitro, and that Mlh1-mlh3-32 (MMR+ crossover-) is defective in endonuclease activity.  The authors suggest that the defects seen in their mutants can be explained by a weakening of protein-protein interactions, which can be tolerated in meiosis but not MMR. They also provide new insights into how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates.  Overall, the authors provide a structure-function map of Mlh3 that reveals the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3’s enzymatic activity. They also illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights for how meiotic recombination pathways are regulated.
 Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern for public health. The emergence of resistance often leads to a switch to new drugs and the discontinuation of older ones. However, this can result in the persistence of resistance indefinitely. Here, we show that host contact structure, in particular heterogeneity in the number of contacts, plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure acts both during the phase of intense treatment, leading to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population, and after the discontinuation of the drug, by affecting the competition dynamics resulting in a mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe both a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability that reversion to sensitivity on the population level occurs after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in the host population is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small.
 Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) are complex neurodevelopmental diseases that are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have identified large structural variants, such as copy number variants ( CNVs ), that are associated with ASD. However, the mechanisms by which these variants contribute to ASD are not well understood. In this study, we used Drosophila as a model organism to investigate the effects of CNVs on neurological phenotypes. We found that dosage changes in unique Drosophila orthologues of genes affected by CNVs in humans with ASD led to synaptic and circadian defects. We also found that pairwise dosage changes in orthologues of genes affected by the same CNV led to synergistic effects on synaptic and circadian phenotypes. These findings suggest that the combination of genetic variants, rather than individual variants, may contribute to the development of ASD.
 Experimental cerebral malaria ( ECM ) is a severe neurological syndrome caused by infection with the parasite Plasmodium berghei ANKA ( Pb ANKA ) in susceptible mice. The pathogenic role of CD8+ T cells in ECM has been well established, but the mechanisms through which they mediate their pathogenic activity during malaria infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we used intravital two-photon microscopy and detailed ex vivo flow cytometric analysis to investigate the behavior of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells during ECM. We found that CD8+ T cells accumulated perivascularly within the meninges of mice with ECM, forming cognate interactions with CX3CR1-bearing antigen presenting cells. However, apoptosis was a rare event in relation to the extensive vascular leakage observed during ECM. Our results support a model where CD8+ T cells mediate ECM via direct recognition of cognate antigen on target cells without the need for additional in situ secondary activation in the brain by professional antigen presenting cells and without causing apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms through which CD8+ T cells cause ECM and may aid the development of improved therapeutic options to treat the condition.
Tungiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans. It is a neglected tropical disease that mainly affects people living in precarious conditions in tropical and subtropical countries. The study aimed to determine the burden of tungiasis in Vihiga County in Kenya. The overall prevalence of tungiasis was found to be 21.5%. The study identified factors that contribute to the occurrence of tungiasis, including low economic status, earthen floor, lack of toilet facilities, age of participant, no regular use of closed footwear, and common resting place inside the house. The findings suggest a need to design cost-effective and easily accessible control strategies for tungiasis.
 The Arabidopsis root tip contains a central xylem axis flanked by intervening procambial cells. The xylem axis consists of two cell types, protoxylem and metaxylem, with protoxylem cells positioned at the margins of the axis and maturing earlier than metaxylem cells in the center. The correct positioning and specification of protoxylem cells depend on a mutual feedback between auxin and cytokinins mediated by the PIN class of auxin efflux transporters and AHP6, an inhibitor of cytokinin signaling. In this work, we implemented a parsimonious computational model of auxin transport that considers hormonal regulation of auxin transporters within a spatial context, explicitly taking into account cell shape and polarity and the presence of cell walls. Our analysis reveals that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels generated by diffusion is a theoretically unlikely scenario. Furthermore, our model shows that such a pattern is not required for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response, rather than variations in cytokinin levels, allow for the necessary feedbacks, which can amplify and stabilize the auxin maximum. Our simulations demonstrate the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for pattern robustness. We predict and experimentally verify a role of AUX1 and LAX1/2 auxin influx transporters in this process. Furthermore, we show that polar localization of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that not only stabilizes the accumulation of auxin within the xylem axis but also provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in the xylem-pole pericycle cells, an important early step in lateral root initiation. The model also revealed that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other.
 The study investigates the role of a transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein B (CREB-B), in the neuropeptide F (NPF) /nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway that regulates phase-related locomotor plasticity in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. The study finds that CREB-B directly activates brain NOS expression by interacting with NOS promoter region. The phosphorylation of CREB-B at serine 110 site changes in response to population density variation and is negatively controlled by NPF2. The involvement of CREB-B in NPF2-regulated locomotor plasticity is further validated by RNAi experiment and behavioral assay. Furthermore, the study reveals that protein kinase A mediates the regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription. These findings highlight a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
 The earliest stages of development in most metazoans are driven by maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs, with widespread transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome occurring hours after fertilization, at a period known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In Drosophila, the MZT is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes; and the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in their transcriptional activation. To better understand the mechanisms of ZLD activation and the range of its targets, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD before (mitotic cycle 8), during (mitotic cycle 13), and after (late mitotic cycle 14) the MZT. Although only a handful of genes are transcribed prior to mitotic cycle 10, we identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. As expected, early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage. However, we also observed ZLD bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT and to virtually all of the thousands of known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is so strong that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This strong early association of ZLD with regions not active until the MZT suggests that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT.
24-hour circadian rhythms are essential for many biological processes in living organisms. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for the regulation of these rhythms. However, the timing of these interactions is largely unknown. In this study, we used a yeast-two-hybrid approach to identify 109 novel PPIs among circadian clock proteins. We found that protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1) interacts with CLOCK/BMAL1, resulting in BMAL1 destabilization. We constructed a dynamic circadian PPI network using circadian expression data and found that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, likely restricting regulatory interactions to specific phases. We also predict that circadian PPIs dynamically connect many important cellular processes, contributing to temporal organization of cellular physiology. Our data provide a valuable resource of circadian PPIs within hepatocytes that are important for keeping the pace of the molecular clockwork and for the control of cellular physiology.
 Nematode polyprotein allergens ( NPAs ) are unusual lipid-binding proteins found in nematodes. They are synthesized as large, tandemly repetitive polyproteins that are post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of small lipid-binding proteins. NPAs are probably central to transport and distribution of small hydrophobic compounds between the tissues of nematodes and may play key roles in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE antibody-based responses in infection. In the present study, the solution structure of ABA-1A, the most common repeating unit of the NPA of Ascaris suum, was determined by protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein adopts a novel seven-helical fold comprising a long central helix that participates in two hollow four-helical bundles on either side. Discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, and the amino acid sidechains affected by ligand (fatty acid) binding were identified. Recombinant ABA-1A contains tightly-bound ligand (s) of bacterial culture origin in one of its binding sites. This is the first mature, post-translationally processed, unit of a naturally-occurring tandemly-repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source and it belongs to a new structural class. NPAs have no counterparts in vertebrates, so represent potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. The nature of the (as yet) unidentified bacterial ligand(s) may be pertinent to this, as will our characterization of the unusual binding sites.
 Ciguatera is a type of fish poisoning that occurs throughout the tropics, particularly in vulnerable island communities such as the developing Pacific Island Countries and Territories ( PICTs ). After consuming ciguatoxin-contaminated fish, people report a range of acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, with some experiencing chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months. Unfortunately, the true extent of illness and its impact on human communities and ecosystem health are still poorly understood. A questionnaire was emailed to the Health and Fisheries Authorities of the PICTs to quantify the extent of ciguatera. The data were analyzed using t-test, incidence rate ratios, ranked correlation, and regression analysis. There were 39,677 reported cases from 17 PICTs, with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people across the region from 1998–2008 compared to the reported annual incidence of 104/100,000 from 1973–1983. There has been a 60% increase in the annual incidence of ciguatera between the two time periods based on PICTs that reported for both time periods. Taking into account under-reporting, in the last 35 years an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders might have suffered from ciguatera. This level of incidence exceeds prior ciguatera estimates locally and globally, and raises the status of ciguatera to an acute and chronic illness with major public health significance. To address this significant public health problem, which is expected to increase in parallel with environmental change, well-funded multidisciplinary research teams are needed to translate research advances into practical management solutions.
Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi that affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is characterized by a chronic phase that can last for decades and lead to severe complications such as cardiomyopathy. The immune response during the chronic phase of Chagas disease is impaired, and the CD4+CD8+ T cell population is expanded. In this study, we analyzed the production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules by CD4+CD8+ T cells before and after benznidazole treatment. We also studied the expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors in these patients after treatment. Our results showed that benznidazole treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells and decreased the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations. Additionally, the co-expression level of the inhibitory receptor was reduced after treatment simultaneously with the enhancement of the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells. After treatment, an increase in the frequency of T . cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α was also observed. These findings suggest that benznidazole treatment partially reverses the exhaustion process caused by T . cruzi infection in these cells with an improvement in the functional response of the T . cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells.
 Phosphoinositides are important lipid signals in plant development and stress response. However, multiple isoforms of the phosphoinositide biosynthetic genes make it difficult to understand the roles of each enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism. Here, we report that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) is the primary phosphoinositide metabolic enzyme in Arabidopsis thaliana. AtPLC2 is involved in seedling growth and ER stress response. Our results reveal the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism and its involvement in seedling growth and ER stress response.
 This study challenges the reductionist assumption that causation occurs at the micro level and excludes the emergence of macro-level causation. The authors use a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power, integrated information ( Φ ), to show that a macro level can "beat" the micro level in terms of cause-effect power. The authors demonstrate this by analyzing a simple logic gate system and coarse-graining ( nearly ) identical elements into groups and averaging over their states. They then repeat the analysis at the macro level by grouping subsets of those micro elements inside black boxes. The authors use the interventional and counterfactual causal framework of integrated information theory to quantify intrinsic cause-effect power and system mechanisms at the micro level and all possible black-boxed macro levels. They demonstrate that the Φ value of systems of black-box macro elements can increase when going from finer to coarser spatiotemporal grains and lead to emergent cause-effect properties at macro scales. The authors use the Boolean network model of the fission yeast cell cycle as an example to demonstrate this.
 Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain ( RC ) and are important for cell survival and adaptation to the environment . However, ROS can also damage cells under certain conditions. To understand the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC, we developed a rule-based model that accounts for electron transport in the whole RC coupled to proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential generation, TCA cycle reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. The model fits respiratory electron fluxes measured in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, and the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I. Our analysis revealed an association of ROS production with levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in species of complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability, previously revealed as a property of complex III, remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted based on theoretical analysis and were confirmed experimentally. These findings provide a new insight into the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC.
Intracellular transport is a vital process that enables the movement of cargo along microtubules. This process is carried out by motor proteins, which are responsible for converting chemical energy into mechanical energy. The transport of cargo by motor proteins is a complex process that involves multiple motor proteins working together. In this article, we report the effects of mutations in motor proteins on the transport of cargo by multiple motor proteins. We found that mutations in motor proteins can lead to an increase in the expected run-length of cargo transport. We also developed a semi-analytical method to analyze the transport of cargo by multiple motor proteins. Our method is easily implementable and can be used to model the transport of cargo by multiple motor proteins of different types.
 We studied learning in terms of behavioral strategies on a 2-choice operant cue discrimination task in two groups of mice, a group with a genetic modification associated with severe learning deficits, namely, a selective knockout (KO) of the Cacna1c gene coding for the α subunit of Cav1.2 L-type high-voltage-dependent calcium channels (Cav1.2NesCre), and matched controls with intact gene expression (Cav1.2fl/fl). Calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels is essential for synaptic plasticity and other cellular adaptations thought to underlie instrumental learning. The CACNA1C gene has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disease, rendering it an important target for understanding learning mechanisms not only in normal but also psychiatric conditions. By studying the detailed pattern of behavioral responses and rewards received across the learning process, combined with analyses based on behavioral (reinforcement) learning models, we found that Cav1.2NesCre mice did not simply exhibit a general learning deficit but rather relied on different behavioral strategies than Cav1.2fl/fl mice. Our results suggest that a selective functional ablation of the Cacna1c gene can modulate the learning process in a specific way, highlighting that much more mechanistic insight could be gained by examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. The results may also have clinical implications for treating psychiatric disorders.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are responsible for spreading many arboviruses, including dengue and Zika. Wolbachia bacteria are being used to control these viruses by reducing the mosquito population. However, the effectiveness of Wolbachia infections depends on environmental conditions, particularly temperature. We found that wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections were not effective at high temperatures, while wAlbB infections were effective at all temperatures. These findings have implications for the success of Wolbachia interventions in different environments.
 Adenoviruses are important human pathogens that have been developed as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines . Previous studies indicated that human infections with adenoviruses are self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts with evidence of some persistence in adenoid tissue . We sought to better understand the natural history of adenovirus infections in various non-human primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes ( chimpanzees , bonobos , gorillas , and orangutans ) and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in stool . Shedding in stools from asymptomatic humans was found to be much less frequent , comparable to frequencies reported before . We purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques . Analyses of the new ape adenovirus sequences ( as well as the 4 chimpanzee adenovirus sequences we have previously reported ) together with 22 complete adenovirus genomes available from GenBank revealed that ( a ) the ape adenoviruses could clearly be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B , C , and E , ( b ) there was evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses , and ( c ) the high degree of phylogenetic relatedness of adenoviruses across their various primate hosts provided evidence for cross species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E viruses . The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing . Furthermore , the presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors .
 The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up the genetic material of eukaryotic cells. The nucleosome is composed of a core of eight histone proteins and about 147 base pairs of DNA, which are wrapped around the histone core about 1.75 times. The DNA in the nucleosome is not static, but can unwrap and rewrap in response to various cellular processes. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the energetics of unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. We found that unwrapping costs about 11.5 kcal/mol, and that the unwrapping occurs asymmetrically, with one end of the DNA unwrapping first and then the other end. These results provide insight into the dynamics of nucleosomes and their role in regulating gene expression.
 Lysosomes are important organelles in the cell that help break down waste and damaged cell parts. They are sensitive to oxidative stress, which can damage their membranes. ApoD is a protein that helps protect lysosomes from oxidative stress. It is found in the blood and is overexpressed in the brain during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the authors found that ApoD is endocytosed and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. It is functionally stable in this acidic environment and helps maintain lysosomal pH gradients and membrane integrity. The authors also found that ApoD is involved in two lysosomal-dependent biological processes, myelin phagocytosis and optimization of neurodegeneration-triggered autophagy. These findings suggest that ApoD plays an important role in protecting lysosomes and maintaining cellular function.
 The study focuses on the life cycle and behavior of Phlebotomus orientalis Parrot ( Diptera: Psychodidae ) in laboratory colonies. The study compares two P . orientalis colonies originating from different sites in Ethiopia: a non-endemic site in the lowlands - Melka Werer ( MW ) , and an endemic focus of human visceral leishmaniasis in the highlands - Addis Zemen ( AZ ) . The study reports marked differences in life-cycle parameters between the two colonies, including distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, analyses using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI mitochondrial genes did not reveal any genetic differences. F1 hybrids developed successfully with higher fecundity than the parental colonies. Susceptibility of P . orientalis to Leishmania donovani was studied by experimental infections. Even the lowest infective dose tested ( 2×103 per ml ) was sufficient for successful establishment of L . donovani infections in about 50% of the P . orientalis females. Both MW and AZ colonies of P . orientalis were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L . donovani strains. The development of L . donovani was similar in both P . orientalis colonies; hence, the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in non-endemic area Melka Werer cannot be attributed to different susceptibility of local P . orientalis populations to L . donovani. The study provides important information regarding the life cycle and behavior of P . orientalis in laboratory colonies, which is essential for the major goal of the work: experimental infections and comparison of susceptibility of both colonies to infections with L . donovani.
 Schistosomiasis is a serious public health problem in China, with an estimated 30,000 cases of advanced schistosomiasis japonica in 2008 . However, the disability weight (DW) for advanced schistosomiasis japonica has not been included in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Therefore, a patient-based quality-of-life evaluation was performed for advanced schistosomiasis japonica. Of 506 candidates, 215 cases were confirmed as advanced schistosomiasis japonica and evaluated. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall DW was 0.447, and age-specific DWs ranged from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged ≥60 years. DWs were positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life. These patient-preference disability estimates could provide updated data for a revision of the GBD, as well as for evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program.
 This study used national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's 7 tsetse belts, known as sleeping sickness areas. The study found that residents and recent migrants of working age living in tsetse-infested areas were more likely to have disability than those living outside of these areas. The study also found that living in poverty and tsetse-infested areas increased the likelihood of disability. The study suggests that incorporating reports on disability from the national census is a promising surveillance tool that may enhance future HAT surveillance programs in sub-Saharan Africa. The combined burdens of HAT and AAT and the opportunity costs of agricultural production in AAT areas are likely contributors to disability within tsetse-infested areas. Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability following the release of the Kenya 2009 census at the local level.
 Hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells . However , its mechanism of action remains poorly defined . In this study , we demonstrate that HMBA activates transiently the PI3K/Akt pathway , which leads to the phosphorylation of HEXIM1 and the subsequent release of active positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb ) from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) . As a result , P-TEFb is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription elongation and viral production . Despite the continuous presence of HMBA , the released P-TEFb reassembles rapidly with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1 . In contrast , a mutant HEXIM1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA via the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonizes this HMBA-mediated induction of viral production . Thus , our studies reveal how HIV transcription is induced by HMBA and suggest how modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb could contribute to cell differentiation .
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites and transmitted by sand flies. The disease can manifest in different forms, including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis. The severity of the disease is influenced by various factors, including the parasite species, host genetic factors, and the presence of viruses that infect the parasites. In this study, the authors investigated the role of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis. They found that LRV is present in various Leishmania species and that its presence is associated with the development of mucocutaneous and disseminated forms of the disease. The authors also developed a new method for detecting LRV in parasites, which could be used for diagnosing leishmaniasis in the field.
 Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EPEC and EHEC ) are closely related pathogens that attach tightly to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. In this study, the authors characterized the colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC during infection of polarized epithelial cells. They found that EPEC and EHEC both formed distinct bacterial communities, or “macrocolonies,” that encompassed multiple host cells. Tir and EspFU, as well as the host Arp2/3 complex, were all critical for the expansion of macrocolonies over time. Unexpectedly, EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions, where bacteria formed a secondary pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one of the daughters to disengage and infect the second cell. Collectively, these data reveal that EspFU enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission.
 Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are small, membrane-bound particles released by cells that play important roles in cell-to-cell communication. EVs have been found in many pathogenic organisms, including helminths, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. However, the optimal method for isolating EVs from helminths is not known. In this study, the authors compared two methods for isolating EVs from the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica: differential centrifugation ( DC ) and size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ). They found that SEC produced smaller and less diverse EVs, with a higher EV purity to free excretory-secretory protein ( ESP ) yield, a less diverse EV proteome, and different EV gene enrichment profiles compared to DC. The authors suggest that SEC may be the better method for isolating EVs from helminths for downstream analysis and application development.
 We present a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in pattern formation. We use detailed quantitative datasets of gap gene mRNA and protein expression to solve and fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation, and establish its structural and practical identifiability. Our results demonstrate that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. Our work demonstrates that the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation, greatly increasing the potential of reverse engineering for the study of development and other similarly complex biological processes.
 Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide, particularly in children under the age of five. The virus is highly infectious and causes severe damage to the small intestine. However, the mechanisms underlying the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection are not well understood. In this study, the authors investigated the role of the innate immune system in the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection using an oral mouse infection model. They found that the expression of the innate immune receptor for viral dsRNA, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but strongly increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 or the adaptor molecule Trif exerted significantly higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes as compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in TLR3 or Trif did not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, the authors detected a major contribution of the non-hematopoietic cell compartment in the Trif-mediated antiviral host response in adult animals. Finally, the authors found a significant age-dependent increase of TLR3 expression in human small intestinal biopsies. These findings suggest that upregulation of TLR3 expression during infancy might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection.
 The study aimed to analyze whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) cases and 870 controls from the NIMH repository. The data came from two centers using different methods to produce sequence and to call variants from it. The study found that gene-based tests, such as SKAT, have better power when the data is combined using mega-analysis rather than meta-analysis. The study also found that principal component-based analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test statistics with appropriate distributions. After quality control and controlling for ancestry, the study found no clear-cut associations, including associations in known ASD genes. The study concludes that rare variants affecting risk are not clustering in a small number of genes.
 Mycetoma is a chronic infectious disease that affects the lower extremities and is caused by fungi. The most common causative agent is Madurella mycetomatis, which forms grains in the tissue. Chitin is a component of the fungal cell wall and is thought to be embedded in the grain. Chitinases are part of the innate immune system and their activity is upregulated in response to chitin. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding for chitinases have been described that result in decreased chitinase activity. In this study, we investigated the association between these polymorphisms and the incidence of mycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis in a Sudanese population. We found that a polymorphism resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with increased odds of mycetoma. No association was found for the polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase. These results suggest that decreased chitinase activity may increase susceptibility towards fungal infections, including mycetoma.
 Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is a common human virus that causes cold sores and can lead to more serious complications such as encephalitis. HSV has two phases of infection: acute and latent. During the acute phase, the virus replicates and spreads throughout the body. During the latent phase, the virus remains dormant in the body but can reactivate and cause another episode of infection. Recent studies have shown that lytic genes, which are normally only expressed during the acute phase, can be transcribed during the latent phase. However, direct evidence of lytic protein expression during latency has been difficult to find. In this study, the authors used a highly sensitive Cre-marking model to show that lytic and latent phases are less clearly defined than previously thought. They found that around half of the HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred beyond the initial acute infection and that lytic promoters can drive protein expression during latency. These findings suggest that the distinction between acute and latent phases of HSV infection may not be as clear-cut as previously thought.
 Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and animals. They are caused by the misfolding of a protein called prion protein, which leads to the formation of aggregates that spread throughout the brain. In this study, the authors compared the cell specificity of prion protein aggregates at early preclinical times post-infection using three mouse scrapie strains that differ in brain regional pathology. They found that the pattern of cell specificity of prion protein aggregates varied among the strains, with strain 22L being mainly associated with astroglia, while strain ME7 was mainly associated with neurons and neuropil. In thalamus and cortex, strain RML was similar to 22L, but in substantia nigra, RML was similar to ME7. The authors also studied the expression of 90 genes involved in neuroinflammation and found that despite the cellular differences in prion protein aggregates, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains. Interestingly, the profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed markedly from that seen in two acute viral CNS diseases. The authors suggest that their findings may have practical relevance for understanding the pathogenesis of prion diseases and for developing common strategies of therapeutic intervention against the seeded polymerization events.
 The physical organization of chromosomes is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. In this study, the authors developed a coarse-grained model for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice that accounts for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density. They show that their simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes. The authors use their formalism to investigate in detail the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). They show that a combination of their coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.
 The study aimed to understand the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs. The authors performed an eQTL analysis in three parts: first, they identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then, they integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project; finally, they built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. They then demonstrated that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. The authors anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.
 HIV-1 envelope proteins (Envs) are the target of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that recognize epitopes consisting of both amino acid and glycan residues. These bN-mAbs require early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway for binding. However, cell lines suitable for biopharmaceutical production that limit N-linked glycosylation to mannose-5 (Man5) or earlier intermediates are not readily available. The authors report the development of a stable suspension-adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that limits glycosylation to Man5 and earlier intermediates. This cell line was created using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing system and contains a mutation that inactivates the gene encoding Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1). Monomeric gp120s produced in the MGAT1− CHO cell line exhibit improved binding to prototypic glycan-dependent bN-mAbs directed to the V1/V2 domain (e.g., PG9) and the V3 stem (e.g., PGT128 and 10–1074) while preserving the structure of the important glycan-independent epitopes (e.g., VRC01). The ability of the MGAT1− CHO cell line to limit glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway without impairing the doubling time or ability to grow at high cell densities suggests that it will be a useful substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens.
 Parasitic nematodes are responsible for devastating diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. One promising target for therapeutic inhibitor discovery is trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase ( T6PP ) from Brugia malayi . In this study, the authors determined the X-ray crystal structure of T6PP from B . malayi and found that it has a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2B-type HAD phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses using a designed competitive inhibitor identified five residues important for binding and catalysis. The model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex indicates a substrate-binding mode wherein shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions drive recognition. The authors suggest that high-affinity inhibitors will be bi-dentate, taking advantage of substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl-binding pocket while simultaneously utilizing non-native binding to the trehalose pocket. The conservation of the key residues that enforce the shape of the substrate pocket in T6PP enzymes suggests that development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics employing this platform may be possible.
 In this study, we present a novel computational framework that incorporates whole, realistic tumors extracted ex vivo to efficiently simulate vascular blood flow and interstitial fluid transport in silico for validation against in vivo biomedical imaging. Our model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, and incorporates spatially heterogeneous blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumor fluid dynamics. We detail the application of our framework to an orthotopic murine glioma (GL261) and a human colorectal carcinoma xenograft (LS147T), and perform sensitivity analysis to gain an understanding of the key biological mechanisms that determine tumor fluid transport. Finally, we mimic vascular normalization by modifying parameters such as vascular and interstitial permeabilities, and show that incorporating realistic vasculatures is key to modelling the contrasting fluid dynamic response between tumor samples. Contrary to literature, we show that reducing tumor interstitial fluid pressure is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion and that therapies should seek to develop an interstitial fluid pressure gradient. We also hypothesise that stabilising vessel diameters and permeabilities are not key responses following vascular normalization and that therapy may alter interstitial hydraulic conductivity. Consequently, we suggest that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumors.
 HIV spreads efficiently both in a cell-free state and from cell to cell, but the relative importance of these two transmission modes in natural infection has not yet been resolved. Here we report on neutralizing antibody activity during cell-cell transmission using specifically tailored experimental strategies that enable unambiguous discrimination between the two transmission routes. We demonstrate that the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and entry inhibitors during cell-cell transmission varies depending on their mode of action. While gp41 directed agents remain active, CD4 binding site (CD4bs) directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, dramatically lose potency during cell-cell contacts. This implies that CD4bs mAbs act preferentially through blocking free virus transmission, while still allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. Thus providing a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs directed antibody responses in vivo.
 Attention has many effects on neural responses, including modifying firing rates and receptive field structure. Several existing models suggest that these effects arise from selective modulation of neural inputs. However, anatomical and physiological observations suggest that attentional modulation targets higher levels of the visual system, such as V4 or MT, rather than input areas, such as V1. Here we propose a simple mechanism that explains how a top-down attentional modulation falling on higher visual areas can produce the observed effects of attention on neural responses. Our model requires only the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. Feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, which in turn alters the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation. This produces firing rate modulations and receptive field shifts. Simultaneously, short-range lateral inhibition between neighboring cells produce competitive effects that are automatically scaled to receptive field size in any given area. Our model reproduces the observed attentional effects on response rates (response gain, input gain, biased competition automatically scaled to receptive field size) and receptive field structure (shifts and resizing of receptive fields both spatially and in complex feature space), without modifying model parameters. Our model also makes the novel prediction that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell.
The posterior signaling center (PSC) is a small group of specialized cells that controls hemocyte (blood cell) homeostasis in the lymph gland, the hematopoietic organ of Drosophila larvae. This role of the PSC is very reminiscent of the "niche," the microenvironment of hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates. In this study, the authors identified a short type I cytokine-related receptor, CG14225/Latran, that is required for switching off JAK/STAT signaling in hematopoietic prohemocytes. This is a prerequisite for massive differentiation of lamellocytes upon wasp parasitisation. The authors propose that this sequence of events culminates in the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signaling by Latran. This is the first in vivo example of a role for a nonsignaling receptor in controlling a dedicated immune response, and raises the question of whether short, nonsignaling receptors also control specific aspects of vertebrate cellular immunity.
 We have investigated patterns of recombination that occur over 120 day long experimental infections of tomato plants with two begomoviruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus. We show that patterns of sequence exchange between these viruses can be extraordinarily complex and present clear evidence that factors such as local degrees of sequence similarity but not genomic secondary structure strongly influence where recombination breakpoints occur. We also find that over-all patterns of recombination are strongly influenced by selection against individual recombinants displaying disrupted intra-genomic interactions such as those required for proper protein and nucleic acid folding. We further demonstrate that recombination patterns can be used to identify the various ways in which recombination can disrupt intra-genome interactions and indirectly visualise long-range intra-genome interaction networks.
 Nucleosomes are the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin and have been shown to influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. However, the relationship between nucleosome positioning and sequence evolution is not well understood. In this study, we compared nucleosome-associated substitution patterns in humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. We found that despite differences in nucleosome structure and composition, the patterns of substitutions around nucleosomes were remarkably similar between the two species. We also found that these patterns were not consistent with mutation or purifying selection acting on static nucleosomes. Instead, we propose that nucleosome repositioning in response to substitutions is a major factor in shaping nucleosome-associated substitution patterns. This finding highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change when assessing selection and mutation biases in the context of chromatin architecture.
 The native state of proteins is characterized by an ensemble of conformers in dynamics equilibrium. Ligands interacting with the proteins select the best conformer in terms of affinity, shifting the conformational equilibrium. Intramolecular vibrational dynamics associated to each conformation should guarantee conformational transitions. We present a novel procedure to identify key positions sustaining the conformational diversity associated to ligand binding. We find a negative correlation between the effects of mutations on these normal mode subspaces associated to ligand-binding and position-specific evolutionary conservations obtained from multiple sequence-structure alignments. Positions whose mutations are found to alter the most these subspaces are defined as key positions, that is, dynamically important residues that mediate the ligand-binding conformational change. These positions are shown to be evolutionary conserved, mostly buried aliphatic residues localized in regular structural regions of the protein like β-sheets and α-helix.
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) is a bacterium that causes tuberculosis ( TB ) in humans. Mtb can survive for a long time in the body and is able to adapt to different environments. Mtb can use different carbon sources to survive, including fatty acids, lipids, glucose, and glycolytic 3-carbon compounds. Mtb also uses CO2 as a carbon source. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase ( FBA ) is an enzyme that is important for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. FBA is essential for Mtb to grow in vitro, but it is not clear why. In this study, the authors used a genetic switch to control the expression of FBA in Mtb. They found that FBA is essential for Mtb to grow in vivo, but it is not essential in vitro if the bacteria are grown on a mixture of glucose and butyrate. The authors also found that Mtb can use butyrate as a carbon source if it is able to co-catabolize glucose. These findings suggest that FBA is important for Mtb to survive in the body, but it is not essential for Mtb to survive in vitro.
2-Cys peroxiredoxins are ubiquitous peroxidases that play various functions in cells. In Leishmania and related trypanosomatids, which lack catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, the discovery of this family of enzymes provided the molecular basis for peroxide removal in these organisms. In this study, the functional relevance of one of such enzymes, the mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx), was investigated along the Leishmania infantum life cycle. mTXNPx null mutants (mtxnpx−) produced by a gene replacement strategy were found unable to thrive in a murine model of infection. Unexpectedly, however, the avirulent phenotype of mtxnpx− was not due to lack of the peroxidase activity of mTXNPx as these behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants added exogenously or generated by macrophages during phagocytosis ex vivo. In line with this, mtxnpx− were also avirulent when inoculated into murine hosts unable to mount an effective oxidative phagocyte response. Definitive conclusion that the peroxidase activity of mTXNPx is not required for parasite survival in mice was obtained by showing that a peroxidase-inactive version of this protein was competent in rescuing the non-infective phenotype of mtxnpx−. A novel function is thus proposed for mTXNPx, that of a molecular chaperone, which may explain the impaired infectivity of the null mutants. This premise is based on the observation that the enzyme is able to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro. Also, mtxnpx− were more sensitive than controls to a temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C, a phenotype reminiscent of organisms lacking specific chaperone genes. Collectively, the findings reported here change the paradigm which regards all trypanosomatid 2-Cys peroxiredoxins as peroxide-eliminating devices. Moreover, they demonstrate, for the first time, that these 2-Cys peroxiredoxins can be determinant for pathogenicity independently of their peroxidase activity.
Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, and fatigue. It is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The current standard for diagnosing histoplasmosis is through blood or bone marrow cultures, which can take several weeks to grow. A new test, called the Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) test, has been developed that can diagnose histoplasmosis more quickly. However, the accuracy of this test has not been well studied in people with HIV/AIDS. In this study, researchers evaluated the accuracy of the HUAg test in diagnosing histoplasmosis in people with HIV/AIDS in Mexico. They found that the test was not very accurate, with a sensitivity of only 67% and a specificity of 97%. This means that the test may miss some cases of histoplasmosis and may also give false positives. The researchers suggest that the HUAg test may be useful for starting antifungal treatment early, but that a culture-based approach is still necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
1.8 million children die from diarrhea annually, and millions more suffer multiple episodes of nonfatal diarrhea. On average, in up to 40% of cases, no etiologic agent can be identified. Metagenomic sequencing has enabled systematic and unbiased characterization of microbial populations, including viruses. In this study, we characterized the eukaryotic viral communities present in diarrhea specimens from 12 children by employing a strategy of “micro-mass sequencing” that entails minimal starting sample quantity ( <100 mg stool ), minimal sample purification, and limited sequencing ( 384 reads per sample ). Using this methodology, we detected known enteric viruses as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with only limited sequence similarity to viruses in GenBank. Our results suggest that metagenomic investigation of the viral diversity found in human diarrhea has the potential to define the spectrum of viruses present in stool during episodes of acute diarrhea and to assess whether these agents play a causal role in human diarrhea.
2014-2016 saw two major arbovirus outbreaks worldwide, dengue and Zika. The Dominican Republic was affected by both, with 17,324 dengue cases in 2015 and 5,235 Zika cases in 2016. This study used retrospective disease surveillance data to identify and describe the transmission dynamics of both viruses, including associated cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The study found that Zika infections were more widely dispersed among the population than dengue, with higher attack rates among females. The reproductive number (R0) of Zika was also higher among females. The study also compared the age and sex-adjusted distributions of both Zika and dengue outbreaks and calculated the reproductive number (R0) of each outbreak. The findings suggest that community awareness campaigns, through influencing short-term health seeking behavior, remain the most plausible mechanism behind increased reporting among women of reproductive age. Media campaigns and screening are therefore recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on clinical Zika outcomes among dengue seropositive individuals.
 Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerases ( PARPs ) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of multiple poly ( ADP-ribose ) units onto target proteins. PARP1 is the founding and most characterized member of the PARP family in humans. In Arabidopsis, PARP2 rather than PARP1 makes the greatest contribution to PARP activity and organismal viability in response to genotoxic stresses. PARP2 carries SAP DNA binding motifs rather than the zinc finger domains common in plant and animal PARP1 proteins. PARP2 also makes stronger contributions than PARP1 to plant immune responses. For poly ( ADP-ribose ) glycohydrolase ( PARG ) enzymes, Arabidopsis PARG1 and not PARG2 is the major contributor to poly ( ADP-ribose ) removal from acceptor proteins. PARP1 and PARP2 interact with each other and with PARG1 and PARG2. PARP1 and PARG1 are localized to the nucleus while PARP2 and PARG2 are localized to the cytoplasm. Overall, the study suggests that PARP2 and PARG1 are the major contributors to poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in Arabidopsis.
 The PHR proteins are a group of intracellular signaling molecules that regulate synapse formation and axon termination. The C . elegans PHR protein, RPM-1, is a ubiquitin ligase that inhibits the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways. We have identified several kinases that are likely to form a new MAP kinase pathway that suppresses synapse formation defects in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants, but not axon termination defects. This pathway includes MIG-15 (MAP4K), NSY-1 (MAP3K), JKK-1 (MAP2K), and JNK-1 (MAPK). Transgenic overexpression of kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons and these kinases localize to presynaptic terminals, providing further evidence of a role in synapse development. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. Interestingly, habituation results are consistent with the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functioning as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1. These findings indicate the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning.
 The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a well-studied system for determining the sex of an individual based on the activity of the transcription factor TRA-1. TRA-1 is controlled by a linear pathway that determines whether an individual will develop as a hermaphrodite or a male. However, TRA-1 is also a member of a complex called the Tip60 HAT complex, which has been shown to have a bipotential function in mammals. In this study, the authors show that the Tip60 HAT complex also has a bipotential function in C. elegans. They found that the Tip60 HAT complex works with TRA-1 to activate the expression of male-specific genes, while also repressing the expression of female-specific genes. The authors also found that the Tip60 HAT complex works in parallel with the linear pathway to control the sex-determination process. They conclude that the Tip60 HAT complex is a key component of the bipotential switch that controls sex-determination in C. elegans.
ΦDM, ΦE, and ΦAR are three new measures of integrated information that overcome the limitations of previous measures. ΦDM is defined for discrete Markov systems, but ΦE and ΦAR are defined for continuous or discrete stochastic systems, Markovian or otherwise. ΦE and ΦAR are easy to apply in practice, and ΦE is equivalent to ΦDM for Gaussian systems. These measures provide new opportunities for examining information integration in real and model systems, and carry implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes. However, our findings pose challenges for theories that ascribe physical meaning to the measured quantities.
 The persistent spread of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) in Uganda has raised concerns of a potential overlap with the Gambian form of the disease . Recent research has aimed to increase the evidence base for targeting control measures by focusing on the environmental and climatic factors that control the spatial distribution of the disease . One recent study used simple logistic regression methods to explore the relationship between prevalence of Rhodesian HAT and several social , environmental and climatic variables in two of the most recently affected districts of Uganda , and suggested the disease had spread into the study area due to the movement of infected , untreated livestock from endemic areas . Here we extend this study to account for spatial autocorrelation , incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters and undertake predictive mapping for risk of high HAT prevalence in future . Using a spatial analysis in which a generalised linear geostatistical model is used in a Bayesian framework to account explicitly for spatial autocorrelation and incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters we are able to demonstrate a more rigorous analytical approach , potentially resulting in more accurate parameter and significance estimates and increased predictive accuracy , thereby allowing an assessment of the validity of the livestock movement hypothesis given more robust parameter estimation and appropriate assessment of covariate effects . Analysis strongly supports the theory that Rhodesian HAT was imported to the study area via the movement of untreated , infected livestock from endemic areas . The confounding effect of health care accessibility on the spatial distribution of Rhodesian HAT and the linkages between the disease's distribution and minimum land surface temperature have also been confirmed via the application of these methods . Predictive mapping indicates an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in the future in areas surrounding livestock markets , demonstrating the importance of livestock trading for continuing disease spread . Adherence to government policy to treat livestock at the point of sale is essential to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda .
 The study of the stability of ecosystems has been a longstanding question in ecology. The consensus that complexity begets stability was challenged in the 1970s, and the assumption that there exists a feasible equilibrium was not tested until recently. The authors of this study found that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species-rich systems. They also found that weak interactions increase stability in structured systems, while strong interactions decrease stability in unstructured systems. The authors suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.
 Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. It is widespread, with a near global distribution. In Africa, there is evidence of endemicity in cattle, small ruminants, and humans, with seroprevalence ranging from 7% to 33% in sheep, 4% to 55% in cattle, and 1% to 32% in humans. However, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, particularly in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to provide a One Health assessment of Q fever epidemiology in parts of Western and Nyanza Provinces, Western Kenya, in cattle and humans. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, and serum samples from 2049 humans and 955 cattle in 416 homesteads were analyzed for C . burnetii antibodies. Questionnaires covering demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information were also administered. These data were linked to environmental datasets based on geographical locations. Correlation and spatial-cross correlation analyses were applied to assess the potential link between cattle and human seroprevalence. Multilevel regression analysis was used to assess the relationships between a range of socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors and sero-positivity in both humans and animals. The overall sero-prevalence of C . burnetii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle, but we found no evidence of correlation between cattle and human seroprevalence either within households or when incorporating spatial proximity to other households in the survey. Multilevel modelling indicated the importance of several factors for exposure to the organism, including cattle obtained from market, those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels, younger age group in humans, variations between ethnic groups, and frequent livestock contact (specifically grazing and dealing with abortion material). These results illustrate endemicity of C . burnetii in western Kenya, although prevalence is relatively low. The analysis indicates that while environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns, human exposure patterns are likely to be driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The implication of livestock markets in cattle exposure risks suggests these may be a suitable target for interventions.
 Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The draft genome sequences of three schistosome species are now available, highlighting the need for functional genomic approaches to identify the role and importance of schistosome genes. Retrovirus-mediated transgenesis is an established functional genomics approach for model species, but vertical transmission of integrated transgenes has not been reported in schistosomes. Vasa is a germ cell-specific marker that has been studied widely in other species. Here, we identified three vasa-like genes in S. mansoni and examined their developmental expression. We found specific expression in the schistosome ovary and strikingly elevated expression in the developing egg. Since Vasa is a reliable germ cell marker in other flatworms, we anticipate that reporter transgenes vectored by an integration competent vector such as MLV and driven by a vasa promoter might be of use to monitor transgene integration into schistosome germ cells.
 Heart valve disease is a major clinical problem worldwide . Cardiac valve development and homeostasis need to be precisely controlled . Hippo signaling is essential for organ development and tissue homeostasis , while its role in valve formation and morphology maintenance remains unknown . VGLL4 is a transcription cofactor in vertebrates and we found it was mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-EMT stage and was maintained till the adult stage . Tissue specific knockout of VGLL4 in different cell lineages revealed that only loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cell lineage led to valve malformation with expanded expression of YAP targets . We further semi-knockout YAP in VGLL4 ablated hearts , and found hyper proliferation of arterial valve interstitial cells was significantly constrained . These findings suggest that VGLL4 is important for valve development and manipulation of Hippo components would be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital valve disease .
Soft selective sweeps are a type of evolutionary process in which a beneficial mutation arises and spreads in a population, but not to fixation. This process is different from a hard sweep, in which a beneficial mutation reaches fixation in a population. Recent studies have claimed that soft selective sweeps are pervasive across organisms of very different effective population size and mutation rate, including humans, Drosophila, and HIV. However, others have evaluated the relevance of these models to natural populations and the identifiability of the models relative to other known population-level processes, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. In this study, we carefully evaluated three recent studies and their underlying methodologies. Using population genetic theory and extensive simulation, we found that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps serve as the more parsimonious explanation. These findings represent a necessary response to the growing tendency of invoking parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of pervasive positive selection and neglecting best practices regarding the construction of proper demographic null models.
 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vector for dengue fever, causing 50–100 million infections per year. Female mosquitoes are known to be inhibited from host-seeking behavior for three days following a blood meal by a humoral factor. Head Peptide-I is a candidate peptide mediating this suppression, but the mechanism by which this peptide alters mosquito behavior and the receptor through which it signals are unknown. In this study, we identified eight Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptors ( NPYLRs ) in the Ae . aegypti genome and screened each in a cell-based calcium imaging assay for sensitivity against a panel of peptide ligands. We found that NPYLR1 responded to Head Peptide-I as well as short Neuropeptide-F peptides ( sNPFs ). Two NPYLR1 homologues identified in the genome of the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis, were also sensitive to Head Peptide-I. Injection of synthetic Head Peptide-I and sNPF-3 inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-blood-fed female mosquitoes, whereas control injections of buffer or inactive Head Peptide-I [Cys10] had no effect. To ask if NPYLR1 is necessary for blood-feeding-induced host-seeking inhibition, we used zinc-finger nucleases to generate five independent npylr1 null mutant strains and tested them for behavioral abnormalities. We found that npylr1 mutants displayed normal behavior in locomotion, egg laying, sugar feeding, blood feeding, host seeking, and inhibition of host seeking after a blood meal. In this work, we deorphanized four Ae . aegypti NPYLRs and identified NPYLR1 as a candidate sNPF receptor that is also sensitive to Head Peptide-I. Yet npylr1 alone is not required for host-seeking inhibition and we conclude that other signaling mechanisms must exist for this important behavioral regulation that function even after removal of NPYLR1 activity.
 Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease caused by parasitic flatworms. The study aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, Nigeria. The study used multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and spatial analysis to determine the risk of schistosomiasis in the study area. The results showed that 82% of the area falls under the high and very high risk category. The study also revealed that environmental factors such as temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/land cover can be used to identify and predict the transmission of schistosomiasis. The study suggests that environmental factors can be used in identifying and predicting the transmission of schistosomiasis as well as effective monitoring of disease risk in newly established rural and agricultural communities.
 Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcal ) meningitis is a common bacterial infection of the brain that causes long-term disabilities in half of the patients. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin ( PLY ) is a key factor in the neuropathogenic potential of the pneumococci. Here, we demonstrate selective synaptic loss within the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex of post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumococcal meningitis. We also observed this effect in mice with pneumococcal meningitis only when the bacteria expressed the pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin PLY. Exposure of acute mouse brain slices to only PLY at disease-relevant, non-lytic concentrations caused permanent dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination, and synaptic loss. The NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and D-AP5 reduced this pathology. Pneumolysin increased glutamate levels within the mouse brain slices. In mouse astrocytes, pneumolysin initiated the release of glutamate in a calcium-dependent manner. We propose that pneumolysin plays a significant synapto- and dendritotoxic role in pneumococcal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. We outline for the first time the occurrence of synaptic pathology in pneumococcal meningitis and demonstrate that a bacterial cytolysin can dysregulate the control of glutamate in the brain, inducing excitotoxic damage.
 Human papillomaviruses ( HPVs ) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers . To develop new means to prevent HPV infections, such as vaccines and microbicides, it is important to understand the infectious life cycle of HPVs . HPVs must first establish their infection within the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but why this is the case has not been understood. In this study, we used chemical biology approaches to reveal that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. We learned that the recipient cell must enter M phase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. These findings provide one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia, where cells are progressing through the cell cycle. These results also have potentially important implications for HPV control.
 Penicillium marneffei is a fungus that causes systemic mycosis in humans and animals. It is a dimorphic fungus that grows as mycelia at 25°C and yeast cells at 37°C. We used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify small RNAs in P. marneffei. We found that small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. We also identified 24 potential milRNA candidates and two genes encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and an Argonaute-like protein. Northern blot analysis confirmed the differential expression of two milRNAs in mycelial phase, which was dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. Our findings provide evidence for the existence of milRNAs in thermal dimorphic fungi and differential expression of milRNAs during different growth phases.
 Zika virus ( ZIKV ) is a mosquito-borne virus that has been spreading rapidly in the Pacific region since 2013. Several mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, have been implicated as potential vectors of ZIKV. In this study, we evaluated the vector competence of field populations of Ae . aegypti and Ae . polynesiensis from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain that circulated in the region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. We found that the infection rates were heterogeneous between the Ae . aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogenous between these populations. For Ae . polynesiensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. Our results indicate a low ZIKV transmission by Ae . aegypti and Ae . polynesiensis tested from the Pacific region. These results suggest the importance of other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, and the large immunologically naive fraction of the population, that may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013–2017 outbreak.
 The long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA ) Xist is a master regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells . To study the structure of Xist in cells , we developed Targeted Structure-Seq , which combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing . By enriching for signals from the RNA of interest , Targeted Structure-Seq achieves high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads , thus providing a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells . We use this approach to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA to develop new models for functional elements within Xist , including the repeat A element in the 5’-end of Xist . This analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved , including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function . , Introduction:  One of the earliest discoveries of a mammalian long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA ) with a well-defined role in gene regulation is the ∼18 kb Xist lncRNA ( NR_001463 . 3 ) [1 , 2] . Xist drives chromosome-wide repression of one of the two female X-chromosomes during mammalian development in order to balance gene dosage between males ( XY ) and females ( XX ) [3–6] . During early development in female embryos , Xist transcription is up-regulated on the future inactive X-chromosome . Xist spreads by a two-step mechanism [7] to eventually coat the majority of the X-chromosome [3–6 , 8] . Xist directs dramatic and mitotically stable changes on the inactive X chromosome , including DNA methylation , histone methylation , and changes in histone variant incorporation . Despite the relatively long history of studying Xist compared to other lncRNAs , surprisingly little is known about the in vivo conformations of Xist or its molecular mechanism [9] . Xist has at least two partially separable functions: silencing of transcription , and spreading on the X chromosome . These functions map to different features within the RNA [10] . The most notable feature of the Xist RNA is a set of diverse regions that include distinct repeat sequences , denoted A-F ( Fig 1A ) , several of which show conservation across species [1 , 2] . Each of these repetitive elements have a different arrangement; for example , the C-repeat region ( 3098-4712 nt ) is composed of 14 copies of a ∼120 nt monomer , while the A-repeat region , located near the 5’ terminus ( 308-733 nt ) , is composed of 7 . 5 repeats of a ∼25 nt monomer consensus sequence connected by poorly conserved , 17-49 nt U-rich linker sequences . The A-repeat region is the most well-studied structural element in Xist , and is necessary and sufficient to cause transcriptional silencing in mouse and human [10 , 11] . This motif has been reported to interact with various protein factors including the polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) [12 , 13] and the ASF/SF2 splicing factors [14] . While deletion analyses have uncovered evidence for other functional elements , the regions of Xist required for spreading and recruitment of other protein factors are still poorly defined [10] . Nonetheless , it is noteworthy that short antisense peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) and locked nucleic acid ( LNA ) oligonucleotides targeting the repeat C region of Xist can cause release of Xist from the chromosome without RNA degradation . [15 , 16] These findings support the notion that the C repeat region of Xist is involved in maintaining the association of the RNA with the chromatin . It remains largely unclear how many functional elements will be found within Xist , where they are located , and how they are structured . Understanding the cellular functions of RNA features within Xist would be greatly facilitated by knowing their in vivo conformations . RNA elements , similar to peptide motifs , can fold into thermodynamically stable structures to fulfill their regulatory roles . Our ability to predict RNA secondary structure using minimal free energy is limited by the size
 Genetic variants have been identified for many complex diseases, but it is controversial whether risk prediction based on genomic profiles will be useful clinically. In this study, a novel unifying statistical framework was developed to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models. The framework connects a large variety of predictive indices together, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the mean risk difference between cases and non-cases, the net reclassification improvement, the proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk, the variance of predicted risks, and the risk at any percentile. The results from simulations match very well with the theoretical estimates. The methodology was applied to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait. The results suggest that genetic tests may be useful in risk prediction for some complex diseases, but not for others.
 The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in comparison with an RDT produced using native antigens and the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT). The new RDT, SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, was found to be more sensitive than CATT and as specific as the SD BIOLINE HAT. Combining two or three tests resulted in a markedly increased sensitivity, although some decrease in specificity was observed. The study suggests that using two or more tests could enhance the sensitivity of diagnostic algorithms for HAT, although further investigation of the practicality and cost-effectiveness of such algorithms is needed.
 Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people in Latin America. In Guatemala, the disease has been effectively controlled in most of the country, but some areas still have persistent infestation. We carried out three cross-sectional surveys in Comapa, Guatemala, to evaluate the impact of vector control activities on infestation and seroprevalence. After multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying, infestation decreased significantly, but seroprevalence in women of child-bearing age remains high. Our findings suggest that sustained vector control efforts are needed to reach the goal of Chagas disease elimination in Guatemala.
 The bacterium Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing ( A/E ) lesions . It shares a common virulence strategy with the clinically significant human A/E pathogens enteropathogenic E . coli ( EPEC ) and enterohaemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) and is widely used to model this route of pathogenesis . We previously reported the complete genome sequence of C . rodentium ICC168 , where we found that the genome displayed many characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen . In this study , through PFGE , sequencing of isolates showing variation , whole genome transcriptome analysis and examination of the mobile genetic elements , we found that , consistent with our previous hypothesis , the genome of C . rodentium is unstable as a result of repeat-mediated , large-scale genome recombination and because of active transposition of mobile genetic elements such as the prophages . We sequenced an additional C . rodentium strain , EX-33 , to reveal that the reference strain ICC168 is representative of the species and that most of the inactivating mutations were common to both isolates and likely to have occurred early on in the evolution of this pathogen . We draw parallels with the evolution of other bacterial pathogens and conclude that C . rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen that may have emerged alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease .
 Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression give rise to distributions of protein levels across cell populations. Despite a mounting number of theoretical models explaining stochasticity in protein expression, we lack a robust, efficient, and assumption-free approach for inferring the molecular mechanisms that underlie the shape of protein distributions. Here we propose a method for inferring sets of biochemical rate constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from stochasticity in protein expression. We asked whether the rates of these underlying processes can be estimated accurately from protein expression distributions, in the absence of any limiting assumptions. To do this, we (1) derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, (2) found that these four moments completely capture the shape of protein distributions, and (3) developed an efficient algorithm for inferring gene expression rate constants from the moments of protein distributions. Using this algorithm, we find that most protein distributions are consistent with a large number of different biochemical rate constant sets. Despite this degeneracy, the solution space of rate constants almost always informs on underlying mechanism. For example, we distinguish between regimes where transcriptional bursting occurs from regimes reflecting constitutive transcript production. Our method agrees with the current standard approach, and in the restrictive regime where the standard method operates, also identifies all of the underlying rate constants. Even without making any assumptions, we obtain estimates of individual biochemical rate constants or meaningful ratios of rate constants in 91% of tested cases. In some cases, our method identified all of the underlying rate constants. The framework developed here will be a powerful tool for deducing the contributions of particular molecular mechanisms to specific patterns of gene expression.
 Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a rare but emerging zoonotic disease that causes a rash and fever in humans. It is endemic in Central and West Africa and has been reported in the United States. There is no specific treatment for MPXV, and the smallpox vaccine has been shown to be effective but not without side effects. In this study, researchers used recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors to express different MPXV glycoproteins in mice. They found that all three vectors were safe and effective in protecting mice against a lethal MPXV challenge. This study suggests that BoHV-4-based vectors could be a promising platform for developing vaccines against MPXV and other emerging diseases.
5’-3’ decay is the major mRNA decay pathway in many eukaryotes, including trypanosomes. After deadenylation, mRNAs are decapped by the nudix hydrolase DCP2 of the decapping complex and finally degraded by the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease. Uniquely, trypanosomes lack homologues to all subunits of the decapping complex, while deadenylation and 5’-3’ degradation are conserved. Here, the author shows that the parasites use an ApaH-like phosphatase ( ALPH1 ) as their major mRNA decapping enzyme. ALPH1 is a novel trypanosome stress granule protein and is involved in mRNA binding. A fraction of ALPH1 co-localises exclusively with the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease XRNA to a special granule at the posterior pole of the cell, indicating a connection between the two enzymes. RNAi depletion of ALPH1 is lethal and causes a massive increase in total mRNAs that are deadenylated but have not yet started 5’-3’ decay. These data suggest that ALPH1 acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of mRNA degradation, consistent with a function in mRNA decapping. In vitro experiments show that recombinant, N-terminally truncated ALHP1 protein, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, sensitises the capped trypanosome spliced leader RNA to yeast Xrn1, but only if an RNA 5’ polyphosphatase is included. This indicates that the decapping mechanism of ALPH1 differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2 by leaving more than one phosphate group at the mRNA’s 5’ end. This is the first reported function of a eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class of enzymes present in all phylogenetic super-groups of the eukaryotic kingdom. The substrates of eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatases are unknown. However, the substrate of the related bacterial enzyme ApaH, diadenosine tetraphosphate, is highly reminiscent of a eukaryotic mRNA cap.
β-cells are responsible for producing insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. In diabetes, the body loses its ability to produce enough insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. Scientists have found that new β-cells can be made from other types of cells in the pancreas. They have also found that a gene called Arx is important for this process. By inhibiting the expression of Arx in adult α-cells, the scientists were able to convert them into β-like cells. These new β-like cells were able to produce insulin and regulate blood sugar levels. This discovery could lead to new treatments for diabetes.
 The initiation of DNA replication is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells to ensure that it occurs only once per cell cycle. However, re-initiation of DNA replication can lead to genomic alterations, which can contribute to cancer. To understand how re-initiation is regulated, researchers have identified a number of mechanisms that prevent re-initiation of DNA replication. However, these mechanisms are not sufficient to prevent re-initiation entirely. In this study, researchers have identified novel genetic elements that are necessary for preferential re-initiation of two origins and sufficient to confer preferential re-initiation on heterologous origins when the control of re-initiation is partially deregulated. These elements do not enhance the S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins and thus are specifically acting as re-initiation promoters (RIPs). The researchers have mapped the two RIPs to ∼60 bp AT rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. During the induction of re-replication, Mcm2-7 reassociates both with origins that preferentially re-initiate and origins that do not, suggesting that the RIP elements can overcome a block to re-initiation imposed after Mcm2-7 associates with origins. These findings identify a local level of control in the block to re-initiation and reveal a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential that is revealed when global mechanisms preventing re-initiation are compromised. Hence, if re-replication does contribute to genomic alterations, as has been speculated for cancer cells, some regions of the genome may be more susceptible to these alterations than others.
170 HIV-1 patients with amebiasis were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical presentation of amebiasis was similar to that described in normal hosts. High fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP were associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis, and three patients died from causes unrelated to amebiasis. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases. Luminal treatment was provided to 83 patients following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment. However, amebiasis recurred in 6 of these patients, a frequency similar to that seen in patients who did not receive luminal treatment. Various genotypes of E. histolytica were identified in 14 patients but there was no correlation between genotype and clinical features. The outcome of metronidazole and tinidazole treatment of uncomplicated amebiasis was excellent even in HIV-1-infected individuals. Luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment does not reduce recurrence of amebiasis in high risk populations probably due to amebic re-infection.
 The study aimed to assess the impact of adding vector control to case detection and treatment on the incidence of Gambian sleeping sickness in the Mandoul area of Chad . The study found that the deployment of tiny targets, which attract and kill tsetse, significantly reduced the number of tsetse caught in traps and the incidence of sleeping sickness in the Mandoul area . The study also used mathematical modeling to estimate the impact of vector control on the incidence of sleeping sickness and found that vector control was responsible for 70.4% of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015. The study suggests that the combination of vector control and medical interventions could lead to the elimination of Gambian sleeping sickness as a public health problem in the Mandoul area by 2018.
 Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. It is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis that is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, but has also been reported in temperate climates. The parasite can persist in the human host for decades without the need for exogenous reinfection. Imported strongyloidiasis is increasingly being diagnosed in non-endemic areas, such as Spain, due to increased migration and international travel. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of patients with imported strongyloidiasis in Spain. The study included 1245 cases from the +REDIVI Spanish Collaborative Network from 2009 to 2017. Most of the patients were immigrants from South America, and detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of the cases. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases. Treatment with ivermectin was the most strongly associated factor to achieve the cure. Given the long latency of the infection and the risk of developing a severe presentation, screening of S . stercoralis infection should be mandatory in patients coming from or had traveled to endemic areas, especially in those with immunosuppressant conditions.
 Vaccines are an important tool for preventing infectious diseases. The inoculum dose, or the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used in a vaccine, is an important consideration in vaccine design. Higher doses generally lead to better immune stimulation but may also cause more severe side effects and reduce population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models and experimental data can help determine the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. We illustrate this concept by fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.
 The development of multicellular organisms is a complex process that involves the coordination of various cellular functions. One important aspect of this process is the control of gene expression, which can be influenced by various factors such as cell-to-cell communication and environmental conditions. In this study, the authors investigated the role of noise in gene expression during the development of a multicellular organism. They used the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena as a model organism and studied the expression of the HetR transcription factor, which is essential for heterocyst differentiation. The authors found that noise in gene expression plays a crucial role in the development of Anabaena filaments and that cell-to-cell communication is important for controlling this noise. They also identified specific proteins that are involved in this process. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms that control gene expression during the development of multicellular organisms.
 Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes encephalitis in humans and reproductive disorders in pigs in the Asian pacific region . The genome of JEV is single-stranded positive-sense RNA consisting of a short 5’ untranslated region , a single open reading frame , and a longer 3’ untranslated region . The single open reading frame encodes a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by both cellular and viral proteases into three structural proteins ( capsid ( C ) , pre-membrane/membrane ( PrM ) , and envelope ( E ) ) and seven nonstructural proteins ( NS ) ( NS1 , NS2A , NS2B , NS3 , NS4A , NS4B and NS5 ) . The JEV enzootic transmission cycle is maintained in nature by several species of mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts . JEV is transmitted predominantly by Culex mosquitoes , but several other genera may participate in certain circumstances [4] . Mosquitoes transmit JEV from a viremic vertebrate to a susceptible vertebrate including humans , birds , pigs and other mammals by bite . After infection by JEV-infected mosquitoes , many domestic and wild bird species demonstrate varying degrees of viremia . Some of which , including young domestic ducklings and chicks , as well as ardeid wading birds develop a level of viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes and are thus considered the amplifying hosts for JEV transmission [4–6] . Among mammal species susceptible to JEV infection , pigs are the only mammals responsible for JEV transmission , because JEV-infected pigs develop a level of viremia that remains high enough to infect mosquitoes for up to 4 days [4] . JEV is phylogenetically divided into five genotypes ( genotype I to V ) based on the nucleotide sequence of the E gene [7 , 8] . Genotype III ( GIII ) has historically been the main causative agent of Japanese encephalitis ( JE ) and was the dominant genotype throughout most of Asia from 1935 through the 1990s . Genotype I ( GI ) was isolated in Cambodia in 1967 and remained undetectable until 1977 when a new isolate was collected in China . Notably , molecular epidemiological surveillance of JEV isolates collected during the last 20 years revealed that GIII has been gradually replaced by GI , showing a genotype shift with GI as the dominant genotype in Asian countries [9–10] . Previous analysis of the differences between the two genotypes at genetic and epidemiological levels suggested that GI displaced GIII probably by achieving a replication cycle that is more efficient but more restricted in its host range [11] . This hypothesis was partially supported by an observation that a GI isolate has significantly higher infectivity titers in mosquito C6/36 cells than two GIII isolates [10] . We therefore evaluated the prevalence of GI and GIII infection in pigs in China and used seven recently-isolated JEV strains including three GI strains and four GIII strains to compare their replication efficiency in vitro and in vivo , with the aim of gaining insight into the reasons for the JEV genotype shift .
The study of biofilm formation in Candida albicans, a fungal pathogen, is important for understanding its pathobiology. A network of transcription factors regulates biofilm formation, but their functional interactions are not well understood. To address this, the authors used a systematic genetic interaction approach based on generating all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and quantitatively analyzing the genetic interactions between them. The network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with all six network heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation. The network shows properties of a small-world network that is highly efficient but not robust. The authors also found that expression of Rob1 is dependent on both auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other network TFs. Finally, the heterozygous Ndt80 deletion mutant is hyperfilamentous under both biofilm and hyphae-inducing conditions in a Tec1-dependent manner. These findings provide new insights into the functions of individual TFs as well as into the role of the overall network topology in its function.
 Asparagine ( Asn ) is an important amino acid that is synthesized by asparagine synthetase ( AS ) from aspartate in an ATP-dependent manner using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source . In this study, we have characterized the asparagine synthetase A ( LiAS-A ) from Leishmania infantum , a parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis in humans. We have shown that LiAS-A is able to use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen donors, and that it is not essential for parasite survival, growth, or infectivity in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. Therefore, we exclude AS-A as a suitable drug target against L . infantum parasites.
 Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection caused by Toxocara canis or Toxocara cati, the common roundworms of dogs and cats, respectively. It is one of the most prevalent helminthiasis worldwide, with a seroprevalence ranging from 35 to 42% in Western countries and from 60 to 90% in tropical settings. Toxocara larvae can migrate to any organ, including the central nervous system, leading to neurotoxocariasis. Several studies have suggested a possible role of toxocariasis in the incidence of epilepsy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all the available data found a positive association between Toxocara spp. seropositivity and epilepsy. However, this association is still debated. To gain further insight on the association between human toxocariasis and epilepsy, we updated our previous research. Our findings suggest that the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy is still positive, even after considering new studies. These findings highlight the importance of further research to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxocariasis-associated epileptogenesis.
 The DNA damage response ( DDR ) is a critical cellular process that helps maintain genomic stability and prevent tumor development. In this study, we describe a new pathway that regulates the DDR through the interaction of ATM, a protein that plays a key role in the DDR, and miR-335, a microRNA that targets CtIP, a protein involved in DNA end resection during homologous recombination repair. We show that ATM-dependent downregulation of miR-335 expression is important for the DDR and that this new pathway is dysfunctional in two patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with constitutive miR-335 overexpression. We also demonstrate that suppressing miR-335 can rescue the radiosensitive cellular phenotype of these patient-derived cell lines. Our findings suggest that miR-335 may be a new target for therapeutic intervention in patients with DDR defects.
 In this study, we investigated the role of mentalizing in learning in the context of social interactions. We asked participants to play repeated games against artificial ( Bayesian ) mentalizing agents, which differed in their sophistication. We found that participants won against the artificial ( sophisticated ) mentalizing agents in the social framing of the task, and lost in the non-social framing. Moreover, we found that participants' choice sequences were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social framing. This study is the first demonstration of the added-value of mentalizing on learning in the context of repeated social interactions. Our results show that we would not be able to decipher intentional behaviour without a priori attributing mental states to others.
 The study proposes an efficient algorithm to implement the estimation of Gaussian graphical model ( GGM ) and obtain p-value and confidence interval for each edge in the graph, based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. . The algorithm is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current implemented algorithm for Ren et al. without losing any accuracy. The algorithm is applied to two real data sets: transcriptomic data from a study of childhood asthma and proteomic data from a study of Alzheimer’s disease. The resulting networks reveal interesting interactions and the differential networks between cases and controls show functional relevance to the diseases. The algorithm has been implemented in an R package named “FastGGM”.
 The striatum is a key brain structure involved in movement and learning. It receives input from the cerebral cortex and sends output to the basal ganglia. The striatum is composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that inhibit each other through local connections. Studies have shown that MSNs display large variations in firing rate on slow timescales, which are thought to be driven by cortical inputs. However, recent work suggests that striatal activity may also be generated internally by the MSN network. In this study, we investigate how striatal activity interacts with cortical driving and how this activity depends on network parameters. We find that striatal activity is optimized in a marginally stable transition regime that occurs at striatally relevant connectivities and synaptic strengths. We discuss how these properties may be utilized in temporally delayed reinforcement learning tasks.
 In this study, we investigated the role of the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p in coupling polarized exocytosis with endocytosis. We found that Sec4p localizes to nascent sites of endocytosis and promotes actin polymerization, which triggers compensatory endocytosis. Our results suggest that Sec4p overrides a limiting step in actin patch formation and directly couples transport cycles to and from the cell cortex. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of polarized growth in yeast.
 Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used pain reliever, but it can cause liver damage in some people. The mechanism of APAP-induced liver injury in mice is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the formation of a toxic metabolite called NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) within hepatocytes. The formation of NAPQI is thought to be zonated, meaning that it occurs more frequently in certain regions of the liver. In this study, the authors used computer simulations to test different hypotheses about how APAP-induced liver injury occurs in mice. They found that a hypothesis that combines two different zonation patterns was able to explain the observed liver damage in mice. This finding could help researchers better understand how APAP-induced liver injury occurs in mice and potentially lead to new treatments for this condition.
 The study aimed to quantify the parasite burden in children congenitally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, at three different diagnostic controls during one-year follow-up after delivery. The parasite burden was estimated by quantitative PCR in 51 children, grouped according to the results of one-year follow-up diagnosis. The results showed that the parasite burden in some children was below the detection limit of the INP micromethod. The study highlights the need for more sensitive parasitological methods to ensure an early diagnosis of T . cruzi congenital infection.
 The paper proposes a biophysical model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and an effective cellular composition from an effective, coarse-grained representation of its genome. The model assumes that E . coli is in a state of balanced exponential steady-state growth, growing in a temporally and spatially constant environment, rich in resources. The model is applied to a series of past measurements where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been measured for seven E . coli strains with an rRNA operon copy number ranging from one to seven (the wild-type copy number). These experiments show that growth rate markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. Using the model, we were able to reproduce these measurements. The model that best fits these data suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E . coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied. Moreover, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven results in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming that under such overcrowded conditions prolonged diffusion times tend to weaken binding affinities, the model predicts that growth rate will not increase substantially beyond the wild-type growth rate. The model therefore suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy number of wild-type E . coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate. Other observations regarding strains with an altered rRNA operon copy number, such as nucleoid compaction and the rRNA operon feedback response, appear to be qualitatively consistent with this model. In addition, we discuss possible design principles suggested by the model and propose further experiments to test its validity.
 The MYB transcription factor family is involved in many biological processes, including metabolism, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. RADIALIS-LIKE SANT/MYB 1 (RSM1) is a MYB-related subfamily member that plays roles in plant development, stress responses, and plant hormone signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms of RSM1 action in response to abiotic stresses remain obscure. In this study, we show that down-regulation or up-regulation of RSM1 expression alters the sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of RSM1 is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) regulate RSM1 expression via binding to the RSM1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal that RSM1 mediates multiple functions of HY5 in responses of seed germination, post-germination development to ABA and abiotic stresses, and seedling tolerance to salinity. RSM1 and HY5/HYH may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. RSM1 binds to the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) and stimulates HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. However, no evidence was found in the dual-luciferase transient expression assay to support that RSM enhances the activation of ABI5 expression by HY. In summary, HY5/HYH and RSM1 may converge on the ABI5 promoter and independently or somehow dependently regulate ABI5 expression and ABI5-downstream ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes, thereby improving the adaption of plants to the environment.
 Mitochondrial complex I is a large and complex enzyme that links the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. In humans, defects in complex I are involved in a wide range of degenerative disorders. Recent progress in X-ray structural analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic complex I confirmed that the redox reactions are confined entirely to the hydrophilic peripheral arm of the L-shaped molecule and take place at a remarkable distance from the membrane domain. While this implies that the proton pumping within the membrane arm of complex I is driven indirectly via long-range conformational coupling, the molecular mechanism and the number, identity, and localization of the pump-sites remain unclear. Here, we report that upon deletion of the gene for a small accessory subunit of the Yarrowia complex I, a stable subcomplex (nb8mΔ) is formed that lacks the distal part of the membrane domain as revealed by single particle analysis. The analysis of the subunit composition of holo and subcomplex by three complementary proteomic approaches revealed that two (ND4 and ND5) of the three subunits with homology to bacterial Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters that have been discussed as prime candidates for harbouring the proton pumps were missing in nb8mΔ. Nevertheless, nb8mΔ still pumps protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. Our results provide evidence that the membrane arm of complex I harbours two functionally distinct pump modules that are connected in series by the long helical transmission element recently identified by X-ray structural analysis.
 Fever is a regulated increase of body temperature that occurs in response to infection. Fever has been shown to play a role in modulating immune responses to infection, but the potential of febrile temperatures in regulating antigen binding affinity to antibodies has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature on the binding affinity of two antibody-antigen complexes from two different fever-inducing infectious diseases. We used selected malarial and dengue antigens against specific monoclonal antibodies, and observed a marked increase in the affinity of these antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C compared to physiological or pathophysiological temperatures. We also observed a notable decrease in affinity at 42°C, possibly due to protein unfolding. These results suggest that fever may play a positive and adaptive role in vivo by enhancing protein-protein affinity for samples with limited availability.
 The actomyosin cortex is a thin layer of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors that lies just beneath the plasma membrane of animal cells. It is responsible for cellular deformation and flow. The production and dissipation of contractile stress in the actomyosin cortex are essential for these processes. In this study, we developed a computational model of a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress. We characterized how the production and dissipation of network stress depend on cross-link dynamics and filament turnover, and how these dependencies combine to determine overall rates of cortical flow. Our analysis revealed that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady state flow in response to external stress. We also found that effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τc, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on crosslink dynamics. These results provide a framework for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling.
 The study aimed to identify the genetic loci responsible for seedling sensitivity to high sugar levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. A quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis was performed using a Col/C24 F2 population. A glucose and fructose-sensing QTL, GSQ11, was identified and mapped to the ANAC060 gene. The Col ANAC060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. The truncated Col ANAC060 protein lacks the transmembrane domain and is constitutively located in the nucleus. The study suggests that the sugar-ABA signaling cascade induces ANAC060 expression, but the truncated Col ANAC060 protein attenuates ABA induction and ABA signaling, resulting in sugar insensitivity. The study provides insight into the sugar-ABA signaling cascade and the role of ANAC060 in sugar sensitivity.
 The bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP is involved in many cellular processes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. The c-di-GMP levels are regulated by two classes of enzymes, diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the HptB pathway controls biofilm formation and motility by involving both HsbD and the anti-anti-sigma factor HsbA. The rewiring of c-di-GMP signaling into the HptB cascade relies on the original interaction between HsbD and HsbA and on the control of HsbD dynamic localization at the cell poles. Our study provides insights into how c-di-GMP signaling can be orchestrated in bacteria to reach output specificity.
 In this study, we investigated how humans learn multiple visuomotor mappings when feedback for each is provided alternately. We found that participants could learn the associations between target shape and required visuomotor mapping and generalise to novel but similar conditions. We also developed a Bayesian learning model that predicted generalisation that is more consistent with categorisation ( i.e., use one mapping or the other ) and found that the model poses a possible mechanism for simultaneously learning multiple visuomotor mappings.
 The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating and fine-tuning motor movements. The inferior olivary nucleus ( IO ) provides one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum, the climbing fibers ( CFs ). Activation of CFs is believed to be related to timing of motor commands and/or motor learning. CF spikes lead to large all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells, overriding any other ongoing activity and silencing these cells for a brief period of time afterwards. Previously reported results from in vitro studies suggested that the information encoded in the climbing fiber burst is related to the occurrence of the spike relative to the ongoing sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation of the olivary cell, i.e., that the phase of the oscillation is reflected in the size of the climbing fiber burst. We used a detailed three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell to further investigate the possible factors determining the size of the climbing fiber burst. Our findings suggest that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited and that charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst. From our findings it follows that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can have a big effect on the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells.
 Iron is essential for life, but its redox properties can also be toxic. The liver plays a central role in regulating iron levels, and a computational model of human liver iron metabolism has been developed. The model includes core regulatory components and their kinetic properties, and has been validated by reproducing previously published physiological data. The model can be used to simulate the response to iron challenges and to identify potential drug targets for treating iron-related diseases.
 The nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) is a selective gateway for material transport across the nuclear envelope ( NE ) . The transport process is highly dynamic and fast, and involves the hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins ( kaps ) and FG-repeat domains . In this study, we developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure that mimics nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ) . The model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is about 2 . 6±0 . 13 ms with an inverse Gaussian distribution for statistically adequate number of independent Brownian dynamics simulations . Moreover , the cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall where it interacts with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel . The kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast , which ensures an efficient translocation through the NPC . Finally , as opposed to intact NPCs , cytoplasmic filaments-deficient NPCs show a high degree of permeability to inert cargos , implying the defining role of cytoplasmic filaments in the selectivity barrier . , Introduction:  The nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) is the exclusive gateway of material transport across the nuclear envelope ( NE ) . This selective gateway plays a critical role in regulating transcription and protecting the genetic material of eukaryotic cells; consequently , its structure is highly conserved from yeast to vertebrates . However , the mechanism of transport across the NPC remains elusive and proposed models thus far remain incomplete and sometimes contradictory even for normal ( wild-type ) NPC . The NPC is composed of about 30 distinct proteins collectively called nucleoporins ( nups ) . Individual nups are directly related to several human diseases including influenza , cancers such as leukemia and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors , and less frequent diseases like triple-A syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . Nups also play an important role in viral infections by providing docking sites for viral capsids , and also by blocking host cell mRNA export or inhibiting import of antiviral signals [17] . For a most recent comprehensive review about NPC-related disease see Jamali et al . , 2011 [18] . Along the same lines , Buehler et al . , 2010 , have recently reviewed the role of protein mechanics in disease conditions [19] . The total mass of the NPC is species-dependent and is about 44 MDa and 60 MDa in yeast and vertebrates , respectively [20] . The dimensions of the NPC also depend on the species . For example , yeast NPCs are 15% smaller than Xenopus NPCs [21] . The subunits of the NPC structure are cytoplasmic filaments , a cytoplasmic ring , a central channel that includes the spoke domains , a nuclear ring , and a nuclear basket that is composed of nuclear rods and a distal ring ( see Figure 2 for the detailed dimensions of Xenopus oocyte NPC ) . The NPC acts as a freeway for passive diffusion of molecules and ions smaller than ∼5 nm in diameter [22] , [23] , while actively controlling and facilitating the transport of larger cargos up to about 39–40 nm [7] , [24] by discriminating between inert and karyopherin-bound cargos . Karyopherins ( kaps ) are a family of soluble proteins by which different cargos are shuttled between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm via a signaling process to form the cargo-complex . A single NPC can accommodate a remarkable rate of transport on the order of ∼1000 translocations/sec , corresponding to a mass flow of ∼100 MDa/sec [7] . Importantly , almost 30% of nups include natively unfolded domains of phenylalanine-glycine ( FG ) repeats , collectively termed FG-repeat domains [25] , [26] . It is believed that the key feature in nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ) is the interaction of kap with these natively unfolded repeat domains , and thus , FG-repeats are the central players in all proposed models . Indeed , distinctions between
 The nonhuman primate ( NHP ) model is often the best experimental model for testing interventions designed to block infection by human pathogens, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. However, significant ethical and economic constraints accompany such models, including a mandate to use as few animals as possible to achieve statistically significant and biologically meaningful results. In many NHP models, it is desirable to use a limiting infectious dose as a challenge, a dose which only infects a fraction of animals at each exposure. Such exposures are generally considered to be more physiological and therefore better mimic the potential clinical impact of vaccination or therapeutic intervention. To date, the most-used example of this is repeated mucosal challenge with SIV or SHIV for testing vaccines, microbicides, or peri-exposure prophylaxes. However, limiting-dose challenge models require careful titration of the infectious agent. Using a dose that is too high (and not physiological) may lead to a false negative effect of the intervention, whereas a dose that is too low will lead to insufficient infections within the time frame of the experiment to yield useful data, consequently using animals for no gain as well as wasting resources. Even a 2-fold error in the challenge dose can significantly impact the power of an experiment. The goal of the analyses presented here was to define a titration protocol that minimized animal use and procedures while estimating the AID50 to within 1.5-fold of the true value. While much of the discussion is based on NHP (and the SIV model), the protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and any animal model. A method for estimating infectious doses was published almost 80 years ago, based on the method by Reed and Muench, one would use as many as 48 animals to estimate the AID50. A seminal paper by Spouge used a Bayesian framework to define a method to estimate the AID50 (and its precision) for intravenous infection. However, the goal at that time was to define a minimal dose infecting all animals in an experiment (e.g., AID99) following intravenous infection (using a purely stochastic model of infection). Here, I model infection based in part on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with the goal of defining a challenge dose that reproducibly infects a fraction of animals; the statistical analysis is similar to a Logit model from Spouge. From this, I define a parsimonious protocol to efficiently estimate the AID50 for a pathogen; this protocol will, on average, only use 15 animals.
 We studied the response of a first-order auditory interneuron ( AN2 ) in crickets to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli and found that adaptation shifts the stimulus–response curves toward higher stimulus intensities, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. The spike responses were thus reduced for low-intensity sounds. We then tested two competing hypotheses about the function of adaptation: infomax and selective coding. Infomax predicts that information conveyed about the entire signal range should be maximized, while selective coding predicts that “foreground” signals should be enhanced while “background” signals should be selectively suppressed. We tested how adaptation changes the input–response curve when presenting signals with two or three peaks in their amplitude distributions. By means of Bayesian data analysis, we quantified the shifts of the measured response curves and also found a slight reduction of their slopes. These decreases in slopes are smaller than those predicted by infomax, and the absolute response thresholds are higher. Most remarkably, and in contrast to the infomax principle, adaptation actually reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals. Less information is transmitted about signals with lower intensity. The response curve changes are also not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis, because the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal does not increase as predicted but remains nearly constant.
 Prions are infectious particles that cause neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. Prions are composed of a misfolded form of a protein called PrPSc, which binds to and converts the normal form of the protein, PrPC, into PrPSc. In this study, the authors used a technique called serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) to propagate PrPSc molecules in vitro. They found that PrPSc molecules lacking one or both of the polybasic domains (PBDs) of PrPC could still bind to and convert PrPC into PrPSc, but that these PrPSc molecules had diminished or absent biological infectivity. The authors suggest that the PBDs may be required for PrPSc to interact with PrPC in a way that generates infectivity. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of prion propagation and infectivity.
 In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning ( IRL ) framework to identify an animal’s behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to C . elegans thermotactic behavior, which involves two strategies: directed migration ( DM ) and isothermal migration ( IM ). We found that fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative, while starved worms used only the absolute temperature. We also found that the AFD neurons are fundamental for the DM exhibited by the fed worms. Our framework can reveal the most preferable/optimal state for the animals and how they reach that state, providing clues for understanding the computational principles in the nervous system.
 Haptophytes are a diverse group of eukaryotic algae that play an important role in aquatic ecosystems. They are responsible for a significant portion of global carbon sequestration and are known to produce harmful blooms. The draft genome sequence of Chrysochromulina tobin, a member of the Prymnesiophycidae subclass, has been sequenced and analyzed. The genome is small (59 Mb) and compact (40% protein coding), and encodes approximately 16,777 genes. Genes important to fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression when monitored over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. The genome harbors the first hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex reported for an algal species, and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. A new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin was also identified, together with two “red” RuBisCO activases that are shared across many algal lineages. The Chrysochromulina tobin genome sequence provides new information on the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes.
 In this study, we investigated the role of the Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using mouse models. We found that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution. Furthermore, concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. The tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features that are common among human Brca1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses demonstrate that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader, triple-negative class defined by clinical markers. Our findings illustrate the compounding effect of acquiring multiple tumor suppressor mutations during tumor evolution and underscore the distinct requirements of each of these canonical tumor suppressor proteins.
Dengue fever is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The primary vector of dengue virus is the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The abundance of Ae. aegypti is influenced by various factors, including the availability of larval development sites. In this study, we examined the relationship between the abundance of Ae. aegypti pupae and the density of larval development sites. We used data from 84,840 water-holding containers surveyed in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, over a four-year period. Our results showed that the abundance of Ae. aegypti pupae was positively associated with the density of larval development sites. We also found that the relationship between pupal abundance and larval density varied by container type. Our findings suggest that targeting the most productive containers could be an effective strategy for reducing the abundance of Ae. aegypti.
 In this study, we investigated the role of the Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) in regulating developmental and behavioral responses to environmental cues in the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . We found that TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of daf-7 and daf-28 genes, which are involved in food-dependent dauer formation and adult foraging behavior. Our results suggest that TORC2 plays a critical role in conveying internal nutrient state information to the nervous system, allowing animals to modulate both developmental and behavioral responses to environmental cues as a function of their metabolic state.
 Pluripotent stem cells are a remarkable model for the study of early development and hold promise as a source for cell replacement therapies. To successfully manipulate pluripotent stem cells in culture, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which they maintain their self-renewal and pluripotency. In this study, we used a combination of gene expression profiling, computational genomic analyses, and biochemical assays to systematically identify novel cis-regulatory sequences that control gene expression in pluripotent stem cells. We identified clusters of genes upregulated in ES cells and PGCs, which include several known markers of pluripotency. We developed a novel algorithm, CompMoby, which combines the strategies of comparative genomics with DNA sequence segmentation to identify sets of motifs in the upstream regions of coregulated genes. Using CompMoby, we identified motifs that are statistically overrepresented in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells and highly conserved across multiple mammalian species. We demonstrate that several of the predicted motifs are novel regulatory elements of gene expression in mouse and human ES cells. Finally, we show that the transcription factor NF-Y binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation. Our results suggest that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species.
 We have solved the crystal structure of a complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues ( NΔ21 ) and a peptide of 60 amino acids ( P60 ) encompassing the molecular recognition element ( MoRE ) of P that binds RNA-free N ( N0 ). The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form , which was solved at 3 . 0 Å resolution , reveals how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization . Small-angle X-ray scattering experiment and NMR spectroscopy on the soluble complex confirms the binding of the MoRE and indicates that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex . The structure of this complex also suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis .
The gap junctions (GJs) in the fly visual system play a crucial role in encoding visual motion information. Our study shows that the presence of GJs enables the fly's visual system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation of the fly's ego motion. This encoding efficiency is near-optimal with respect to the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. The subpopulation of triplets of the vertical system cells, which are directly connected to downstream neurons, encodes motion more efficiently than the network as a whole. This efficient encoding of motion is behaviorally important, as the fly's survival depends on its ability to perform evasive maneuvers. Our study provides new insights into the functional role of GJs in sensory information processing and highlights the importance of considering specific network connectivity in understanding the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries.
 We have previously identified human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 ( PSGL-1 ) as a functional cellular receptor for EV71 infection in leukocytes . In this study, we investigated the role of post-translational modifications of PSGL-1 in the binding to EV71. We found that tyrosine sulfation of the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 facilitates PSGL-1–EV71 interaction and viral replication of EV71-PB in Jurkat T cells. To our knowledge, this is the second direct example of the involvement of tyrosine sulfation in specific virus-receptor interactions, a modification that mediates viral entry and replication in target cells.
Leishmaniasis is a serious global health problem that affects many people worldwide. The parasite is carried by the female phlebotomine sand fly and can infect a variety of mammalian species, including humans. Treatment with several agents is available, but drug toxicity and the emergence of resistant strains render available treatments ineffective in the long run. In this study, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of several mTOR inhibitors in controlling infection with Leishmania major. Rapamycin, GSK-2126458 and KU-0063794 were administered to BALB/c mice, which had received an intrafootpad injection of the parasite. Footpad swelling and parasite burden were assessed, and cytokine production by mouse splenocytes and phenotypic changes in draining lymph node cells were evaluated. Treatment with a clinically relevant dose of rapamycin or with GSK-2126458 dramatically lowered both the footpad swelling and the parasite load in the draining lymph node. Importantly, the employed dose of rapamycin did not kill the promastigotes in vitro as judged by 3- ( 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assays and electron microscopy. Moreover, the IL-4 production capacity of splenocytes harvested from infected mice that were treated with rapamycin was significantly reduced. Consequently, the IFN-γ:IL-4 production ratio was elevated, suggesting a T helper-type 1 ( Th1 ) -skewed cytokine profile. Finally, the expression level of CD69 , an early activation marker, on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was enhanced in rapamycin-treated mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors may be used in therapeutic settings for the management of leishmaniasis. We propose that the beneficial effects of such inhibitors stem from their immunomodulatory properties. Therefore, the adjuvanticity of mTOR inhibitors may also be considered in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.
 Natural transformation is a process by which bacteria take up and incorporate foreign DNA into their genomes. This process is tightly controlled in many competent species, including Neisseria meningitidis, which preferentially takes up its own DNA. The protein ComP has been identified as the receptor for DNA uptake in Neisseria species. In this study, the authors show that ComP is essential for transformation in both the presence and absence of DUS, and that each base of the DUS sequence is important for efficient recognition by ComP. They also show that naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals are impaired for transformation of N. meningitidis. Finally, they show that a ComP homolog in one of these commensals can bind its cognate DUS and mediate DUS-enhanced transformation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of natural transformation in Neisseria species.
 Cytokinesis is the final stage of the eukaryotic cell cycle, when a mother cell separates into two daughter cells. In fungal cells, cytokinesis is mediated by a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) that is conserved between fungal and animal cells. Fission yeast CAR is composed of many proteins besides F-actin and heavy and light chains of myosin II. Significant progress in identifying and characterizing the proteins that participate in CAR positioning, assembly, stabilization, and integrity has already been made. The septum of fission yeast is a three-layered polysaccharide structure made of a middle primary septum (PS) flanked by two secondary septa (SS), one on each side. Both the PS and SS are formed by essential β-glucans. The enzyme involved in their formation is the β (1,3) glucan synthase, composed of at least a regulatory and a catalytic subunit. Fission yeast contains four different catalytic subunits named Bgs1 to Bgs4. Bgs1 is responsible for the linear β (1,3) glucan necessary for PS formation; Bgs4 builds branched β (1,3) glucan, which is the most abundant polymer in the septum and cell wall. During cytokinesis, this polymer is required for connecting the CAR to the extracellular cell wall, for SS formation, for the correct PS structure, and to maintain the cell integrity during cell separation. A key protein for CAR positioning and function is the F-BAR domain-containing phosphoprotein Cdc15. Dephosphorylation of Cdc15 at mitotic entry induces a conformational switch in the protein that promotes oligomerization. Cdc15 also participates in endocytosis and it has recently been shown that it localizes to the Golgi where it helps in the delivery of Bgs1 to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis. Another F-BAR domain protein, Rga7, associates with Imp2 in a protein complex that coordinates the late stages of cytokinesis. Animal cell paxillin is a multi-domain scaffold protein that localizes to the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane in sites of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Fission yeast Pxl1 is a component of the CAR that shares with other paxillins the Lin-11, Isl-1, Mec-3 (LIM) domains in its C-terminal half but presents a different N-terminal region, which is required for binding to the Cdc15 and Imp2 SH3 domains. Pxl1 also binds to the type II myosin Myo2 and is necessary for CAR integrity and proper constriction. In this work, the authors show that the functions of Pxl1 in the CAR and Bgs1 in the membrane are necessary for stable CAR anchorage. Additionally, cooperation between Pxl1 and Bgs1 is shown to be essential for CAR maintenance and septum formation, since cells without Bgs1 display CAR disassembly and cannot form septa when Pxl1 is absent or when the Pxl1 levels in the ring are reduced, as in the case of cells carrying the defective cdc15ΔSH3 allele.
 Glanders is a rare but serious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei . It affects horses and camels and can be transmitted to humans. Glanders was recently reported in Bahrain, and the authors of this study used high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing to investigate the outbreak. They found that the samples from the outbreak in Bahrain separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting a complex epidemiological background and evidence for the involvement of multiple B . mallei strains. Additionally, the samples from Bahrain were more closely related to B . mallei isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 than other B . mallei, indicating repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE B . mallei populations to each other may be indicative of a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains. The recent emergence of glanders in combination with worldwide horse trading might pose a new risk for human infections.
 Leishmaniasis is a complex disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. It is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with about 67,000 new cases reported each year. The severity of the disease depends on the parasite species, but species confirmation is not feasible in most cases. The World Health Organization recommends pentavalent antimonial derivatives (Glucantime or Sodium Stibogluconate) as first-line treatment for American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis. However, the cure rate of this treatment is about 75%, and the reasons for treatment failure are not well known. In this study, we characterized the clinical and parasitological features of patients with ACL that did not respond to Glucantime. We found that the main parasite species associated with lesions of patients that underwent treatment failure or relapse was L. braziliensis. We also found that parasites isolated from patients that underwent treatment failure showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility associated with previous administration of the medicament. Our results suggest that the indication of a second round of treatment in therapeutic failure of ACL caused by L. braziliensis with pentavalent antimonial derivatives is discussable.
 We report here the nearly complete genomic sequence of 20 different individuals , determined using “next-generation” sequencing technologies . We use these data to characterize the type of genetic variation carried by humans in a sample of this size , which is to our knowledge the largest set of unrelated genomic sequences that have been reported . We summarize different categories of variation in each genome , and in total across all 20 of the genomes , finding a surprising number of variants predicted to reduce or remove the proteins encoded by many different genes . This work provides important fundamental information about the scope of human genetic variation , and suggests ways to further explore the relationship between these genetic variants and human disease .
 The study presents a new approach to calculating the probability of a multiple sequence alignment given a phylogenetic tree and an evolutionary model that accounts for insertions and deletions in addition to substitutions. The approach is based on a non-reversible generative model of insertions and deletions, which is incorporated into an existing phylogenetic inference application. The study shows that the new approach improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm. The study uses standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new “concordance test” benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach. The study concludes that the new approach is a valuable tool for phylogenetic inference and sequence analysis.
 Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is a common human pathogen that causes recurrent infections of the skin and mucous membranes. The initial infection is usually asymptomatic, but subsequent infections can cause painful blisters and lesions. The immune response to HSV is complex and involves both innate and adaptive immune cells. Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are key players in the immune response to HSV, as they are responsible for presenting HSV antigens to T cells. In this study, the authors used human skin explants and biopsies to investigate the interactions between HSV-infected Langerhans cells ( LCs ) and dermal DCs. They found that LCs containing HSV or HSV antigen interacted with BDCA3+ dermal DCs, which are equivalent to murine CD103+ dermal DCs. These interactions occurred in clusters of cells in the dermis and may play a key role in the immune response to HSV. The authors also found that LCs containing HSV or HSV antigen were taken up by BDCA3+ dermal DCs in vitro. These findings provide important insights into the immune response to HSV and may lead to new strategies for treating and preventing HSV infections.
 Leishmania spp. are intracellular parasites that infect macrophages and cause a variety of diseases in humans and animals. The parasites reside in a specialized organelle called the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), which is derived from the host cell's endolysosomal system. The PVs of Leishmania spp. are unique in that they can fuse with each other, allowing the parasites to grow and divide within the same vacuole. In this study, we used multidimensional imaging to study the biogenesis of Leishmania PVs in live macrophages. We found that the PVs of Leishmania major are small and tight-fitting, while the PVs of Leishmania amazonensis are large and loose. We also found that the PVs of Leishmania major undergo fission, while the PVs of Leishmania amazonensis undergo fusion. These findings provide new insights into the biogenesis and dynamics of Leishmania PVs, which may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of Leishmania diseases.
 The study investigates the role of chromatin structure in regulating homology-directed repair (HDR) in chicken B cells. The authors found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. They also demonstrated that tethering the heterochromatin protein HP1 to the pseudo-Vλ donor array diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vλ array and altered the outcome of Vλ diversification, so that nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations predominated. These results suggest that chromatin structure regulates HDR and may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.
The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating our movements and adapting to new situations. It is commonly thought that the cerebellum uses error information to guide motor learning, but a recent study on monkeys has challenged this idea. The study found that climbing fibers, which are thought to only transport information on instant errors, actually have a complex spike signature that lasts much longer than the error itself. This suggests that the climbing fiber system may play a more complex role in motor learning than previously thought.
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. The most common pathologic characteristic of ALS is the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions rich in the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43. Using a yeast model of ALS exhibiting TDP-43 dependent toxicity, we now show that TDP-43 overexpression dramatically alters cell shape and reduces ubiquitin dependent proteolysis of a reporter construct. Furthermore, we show that an excess of the Hsp40 chaperone, Sis1, reduced TDP-43’s effect on toxicity, cell shape and proteolysis. The strength of these effects was influenced by the presence of the endogenous yeast prion, [PIN+]. Although overexpression of Sis1 altered the TDP-43 aggregation pattern, we did not detect physical association of Sis1 with TDP-43, suggesting the possibility of indirect effects on TDP-43 aggregation. Furthermore, overexpression of the mammalian Sis1 homologue, DNAJB1, relieves TDP-43 mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons, suggesting that Sis1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.
 Chagas disease is a major public health issue in many Latin American countries. The parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has six discrete typing units (DTUs), which are associated with different clinical manifestations of the disease. In this study, we used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) approaches to perform the molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. We found that 35 patients presented positive amplification by real time qPCR, with 20 patients with the clinical indeterminate form and 15 patients with the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old. We were able to genotype the T. cruzi DTU in 28 patients (80%). Our results contribute to update the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the age of patient and infection by TcII as important features that lead to the observation of higher parasitemia levels.
Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus that affects humans and animals. It is most commonly transmitted by bites from infected animals, such as dogs and bats. In Guatemala, rabies is considered enzootic in bats, but little is known about the prevalence of rabies in different bat species. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted enhanced bat rabies surveillance in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011. We collected samples from 672 bats of 31 species and tested them for rabies virus (RABV) detection. We found that the prevalence of RABV detection among all collected bats was low (0.3%). However, we did detect RABV in the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). We also found RABV in oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, and in all tissues except the liver of one bat. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene showed that both viruses were 100% identical, while sequencing of the glycoprotein gene revealed one non-synonymous substitution (302T, S). The two vampire bat RABV isolates in this study were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, we found that 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody. Our results suggest that rabies is not widespread in Guatemalan bats, but that vampire bats may be a significant reservoir of rabies virus.
 The nuclear lamina is a protein structure that surrounds the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and plays a role in organizing the chromatin. In this study, the authors found that the nuclear lamina is important for the regulation of gene expression during herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. They found that the HSV genome is associated with increased heterochromatin in cells lacking the nuclear lamina protein lamin A/C. This suggests that the nuclear lamina may play a role in regulating the chromatin structure during HSV infection. The authors also found that the nuclear lamina is important for the targeting of the HSV genome to the nuclear periphery, which is thought to be important for the regulation of gene expression. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of the nuclear lamina in regulating gene expression during HSV infection.
Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for cells. They originated from proteobacteria and have a protein import system that is common to all forms of mitochondria. However, the protein import system in anaerobic mitochondria, such as hydrogenosomes, is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the protein import system in hydrogenosomes of the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. We found that the hydrogenosomal protein import system, named TvTOM, is a highly divergent translocase that forms a triplet-pore complex. We also identified two receptors that are responsible for substrate binding. Our results suggest that the triplet-pore TOM complex was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor and that receptors evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
313 healthy individuals were studied to identify genetic variants affecting the expression of genes involved in immune response in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The analysis revealed that genetic control of gene expression in T cells is extensive and cell type-specific. Disease-associated variants were found to affect the expression of genes involved in immune response. A common missense variant in IL27 was identified, which affects the STAT1 and IRF1 pathway in CD4+ T cells. The study provides insights into the basic processes of gene expression regulation in T cells and advances our understanding of the pathways involved with disease susceptibility in the adaptive immune system.
 The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been struggling to eliminate Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) despite decades of efforts. Socio-cultural and economic factors are major barriers to HAT screening and treatment in the DRC. In this study, we conducted qualitative research in two provinces lagging behind in HAT elimination to better understand and address these barriers. We found that strong prohibitions associated with HAT treatment regimens are well-known by the community and lead some people to avoid HAT screening campaigns. These prohibitions were originally aimed at mitigating the severe adverse effects of the melarsoprol regimen but became obsolete with the new safer drugs. Correct health information regarding HAT treatment is essential, and health providers should address the perspective of the community in a constant dialogue to keep abreast of unintended transformations of meaning. Our findings can help improve the coverage of ongoing HAT screening and treatment activities in the DRC.
 The study aimed to estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan, where the disease is endemic. The study conducted a door-to-door survey in 45 villages and found that the incidence of VL was 7.9 cases per 1000 people per year. The study also found that the medical teams examined 551 individuals referred for a history of fever, and out of these, 16 were diagnosed with primary VL. The study concluded that VL represents a significant health burden in eastern Gedaref State, and active VL case detection had a very low yield in this specific setting with adequate access to care. The study recommends that other interventions, such as indoor residual spraying and bednet use, should be evaluated to control the disease.
The authors have developed a new method to measure the supercoiling of bacterial DNA in vivo. They used a "supercoil sensor" that contains a complete Lac operon flanked by directly repeated resolvase binding sites. By measuring the recombination efficiency of the sensor, they were able to determine the supercoiling density of the chromosome at different locations. They found that supercoiling density varies throughout the chromosome and that transcription plays a role in determining the supercoiling density. They also found that mutations in gyrase and topoisomerase IV cause significant changes in supercoiling density.
 Leishmania is a parasite that causes a range of diseases in humans and animals. It replicates within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) that share many features with late endosomes/lysosomes. The size of these vacuoles varies depending on the species of Leishmania, with L. amazonensis causing large PVs that expand during infection. In this study, the authors found that the gene LYST/Beige, which regulates lysosome size, is upregulated during L. amazonensis infections. Mutations in this gene caused further PV expansion and enhanced parasite replication, while overexpression of LYST/Beige led to small PVs that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of cells with vacuolin-1, which expands PVs, reversed the phenotype of LYST/Beige over-expressing cells, expanding PVs and promoting parasite growth. In contrast, treatment with E-64d, which reduces PV size, inhibited L. amazonensis replication. Enlarged PVs appear to protect parasites from oxidative damage, since inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on L. amazonensis viability within large PVs, but enhanced their growth within LYST/Beige-induced small PVs. The authors conclude that the upregulation of LYST/Beige in infected cells functions as a host innate response to limit parasite growth, by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival.
 The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome ( AHDS ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, delayed development, and motor impairment. The disorder is caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 ( MCT8 ) gene, which encodes a protein that transports thyroid hormones across cell membranes. In order to better understand the mechanisms of AHDS, researchers have generated a zebrafish model of the disorder using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. The zebrafish model exhibits similar neurological and behavioral deficiencies to those seen in human patients with AHDS, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. These deficiencies are associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and circuit-specific deficiencies in axon branching and synaptic density. The researchers also found that TH analogs can restore a portion of the neurological phenotypes in the zebrafish model. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for the disorder and a potential treatment option.
 We have shown that HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early after their synthesis and in the absence of other viral proteins. gB and gH/gL interact with each other regardless of whether they are able to mediate membrane fusion. gB-gH/gL complexes are incorporated into HCMV virions without receptor binding or membrane fusion. These data suggest a different model for how HCMV gB and gH/gL molecules interact and function compared with models for HSV-1 entry. Our data support the hypothesis that stable, preformed HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes are present in the virion envelope and that gB-gH/gL complexes might initiate membrane fusion between the virion envelope and cellular membranes.
 Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is a maternally inherited high copy genome that is important for energy production in cells. Mutations in mtDNA can lead to a wide range of clinical disorders, and the segregation of these mutations in cells is influenced by a variety of factors. In this study, the authors used a heteroplasmic mouse model to investigate the mechanisms of mtDNA segregation in leukocytes. They found that Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, is a critical regulator of this process. Gimap3 is important for T cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and in modulating human mitochondrial diseases. The authors' findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of mtDNA segregation and may help to better understand the genetic regulation of mitochondrial diseases.
 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a rare bacterial infection that causes skin ulcers and can lead to severe disfigurement and disability. It is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and is most common in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, but has also been reported in other parts of the world. In Victoria, Australia, a sustained outbreak of BU occurred on the Bellarina peninsula between 2002 and 2012, with a mean incubation period of 4.5 months. Since then, a new endemic area has developed on the Mornington peninsula, and a retrospective review of 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria between 2013 and 2016 found that the mean incubation period for short-term visitors to endemic regions was 143 days ( 4.8 months ). This study provides valuable information for clinicians and public health officials to better understand the transmission of BU and to develop effective prevention strategies.
 The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that causes toxoplasmosis in humans and animals. The parasite obtains nutrients from its host, including cholesterol, which is essential for its growth and survival. Cholesterol is transported into the parasite through a variety of mechanisms, including endocytosis and direct transfer from the host cell. The parasite has a protein called TgNCR1 that is related to human NPC1, a protein that is involved in cholesterol transport. TgNCR1 is important for the parasite's growth and survival, and it may play a role in regulating cholesterol levels within the parasite.

 Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, and post-axial oligosyndactyly. We have identified a locus for OAS on 14q24.2 and subsequently identified homozygous, predicted loss-of-function mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight out of fourteen unrelated families with OAS. Whole mount in situ hybridization combined with optical projection tomography shows site- and stage-specific developmental expression of the orthologous mouse gene, Smoc1, in embryonic limb bud and craniofacial structures. The phenotype associated with homozygosity for a targeted “pre-conditional” gene-trap mouse mutation of Smoc1 also shows significant overlap with the human disease. We discuss the potential role for SMOC-1 in modulating BMP signaling during eye and limb development.
 The interferon system is a well-studied branch of the innate immune system that acts against viruses. Infection of vertebrate cells by many viruses provokes synthesis and secretion of interferons ( IFNs ) , which mediate induction of a cellular antiviral state that obstructs further viral spread. Type I IFNs ( α and β ) are produced by many cell types , while Type II IFN ( gamma ) is produced by immune cells . IFN-induced signaling pathways begin with IFN binding to IFN receptors at the cell surface . This results in signal transduction via the Jak/Stat pathway , which leads to activation of interferon-responsive genes and synthesis of effector proteins , including PKR , RNAseL , Mx , and many others ( reviewed in [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] ) . For HIV , previous studies have implicated IFNs in blocking both early and late stages of the HIV-1 lifecycle [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] . In many cell types , the inhibition of later steps in the life cycle following integration seems to be most potent ( reviewed in [2] ) . Although the effector mechanisms acting late have not been fully clarified , one report suggested that the IFN-inducible protein ISG15 interfered with the endosomal trafficking pathway used by HIV-1 to exit 293T cells by blocking the interaction of TSG101 with HIV-1 Gag [11] . Many tripartite motif ( TRIM ) proteins may function in innate immunity to restrict viral replication . TRIM5α from rhesus macaque ( RhTRIM5α ) blocks early replication steps of HIV-1 and other retroviruses ( reviewed in [12] ) ; in addition , one group has proposed that RhTRIM5α acts late during HIV replication as well [13] . The early target of RhTRIM5α is the capsid ( CA ) protein , which forms the protein shell of the viral core . Anti-HIV-1 activity has also been reported for other TRIM family members . TRIM1 has been shown to target the CA protein at an early stage pre-reverse transcription , TRIM22 has been suggested to affect HIV transcription and TRIM19 and TRIM32 have been suggested to affect trafficking of viral proteins ( reviewed in [14] ) . Recently , TRIM28 was shown to repress transcription from a retroviral promoter by binding to proviral DNA [15] . TRIM proteins contain a highly conserved RBCC motif comprised of a RING domain , one or two B-box domains , and a predicted coiled-coil region ( reviewed in [14] ) . The RING domain contains a specialized zinc finger [16] and has been shown to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] . Little is known about the B-box domain , which is unique to TRIM proteins . The coiled-coil domain is believed to promote protein oligomerization [23] . Several TRIM proteins also contain a C-terminal SPRY domain that is proposed to be involved in protein-protein interactions and RNA binding [24] , [25] . Many TRIM family members are inducible by IFNs , providing candidate mediators of IFN inhibition . In an effort to identify TRIM proteins mediating anti-retroviral activity , we carried out transcriptional profiling of IFN-treated human osteosarcoma ( HOS ) cells and found that TRIM22 was the most up-regulated TRIM queried on the microarray used . HOS-CD4/CXCR4 cells were studied because they support robust HIV replication and show a strong antiviral response to IFNβ . Human TRIM22 ( also known as Staf-50 ) was previously identified from a search for IFN-regulated genes in Daudi cells . Over-expression of TRIM22 was reported to repress transcription from the HIV-1 LTR in a plasmid reporter system in COS-1 cells [26] . In a later study by another group , over-expression of TRIM22 was reported to inhibit HIV-1 replication in human macrophages and 293T cells and postulated
 We have shown that parasitic fig wasps may play a role in the maintenance of the mutualism between fig trees and their pollinator wasps. We found that parasitic wasps are more likely to parasitize pollinator offspring in the outer layers of ovules, which increases the fitness value of inner ovules to foundress pollinators. This means that parasitic wasps may be one of the selection pressures that have resulted in foundresses favoring inner ovules. Our findings suggest that parasitic fig wasps may make a contribution to the maintenance of the fig-pollinator mutualism.
 Plant height is a complex trait influenced by genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we used a Setaria recombinant inbred line population to assess the genetic architecture of plant height in response to different developmental queues, water availability, and planting density. We found that plant height is reduced under water limitation and high density planting and affected by growth environment. The results support a model where plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait and that the major genetic loci that influence plant height function independent of growth environment. The identity and contribution of loci that influence height change dynamically throughout development. The reduction of growth observed in water limited environments is a consequence of delayed progression through the genetic program that establishes plant height in Setaria. Alleles inherited from the weedy S . viridis parent act to increase plant height early, whereas a larger number of small effect alleles inherited from the domesticated S . italica parent collectively act to increase plant height later in development. This study provides a better understanding of the genetic architecture of plant height and its response to environmental factors.
 The wetlands of the Brazilian Pantanal are home to a diverse range of wildlife and mosquitoes, which makes them ideal for the transmission of zoonotic arboviruses. A recent study found evidence of various flaviviruses in horses in the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal, including ILHV. To further investigate the circulation of ILHV in the region, we collected and tested adult mosquitoes for infectious virus and for flavivirus RNA detection. We found one pool of Aedes scapularis mosquitoes positive for ILHV by culture and real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1000. Our findings confirm the circulation of ILHV in the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal and highlight the importance of continued surveillance for arboviruses in this region.
Scabies is a common skin infection caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. It is a major public health burden, particularly in developing countries. Current treatments with topical agents and/or oral ivermectin are insufficient and drug resistance is emerging. Moxidectin (MOX), with more advantageous pharmacological profiles, may be a promising alternative. Using a porcine scabies model, 12 pigs were randomly assigned to receive orally either MOX (0.3 mg/kg once) or IVM (0.2 mg/kg twice) or no treatment. We evaluated treatment efficacies by assessing mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies reductions. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. At day 14 post-treatment, all four MOX-treated but only two IVM-treated pigs were mite-free. MOX efficacy was 100% and remained unchanged until study-end (D47) compared to 62% (range 26–100%) for IVM, with one IVM-treated pig remaining infected until D47. Clinical scabies lesions, pruritus, and anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies had completely disappeared in all MOX-treated but only 75% of IVM-treated pigs. MOX persisted ~9 times longer than IVM in plasma and skin, thereby covering the mite’s entire life cycle and enabling long-lasting efficacy. Our data demonstrate that oral single-dose MOX was more effective than two consecutive IVM-doses, supporting MOX as a potential therapeutic approach for scabies.
β-lactam antibiotics target the final stages of peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis in bacteria, making them one of the most effective classes of antibiotics. However, the large number of proteins involved in PG synthesis makes it difficult to determine the specific role of each protein. Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that has a minimal number of proteins involved in PG synthesis, making it a good model for studying this process. In this study, the authors constructed a S. aureus strain that encodes only two essential proteins involved in PG synthesis, PBP1 and PBP2. They found that this strain was capable of PG synthesis, but was highly susceptible to cell wall-targeting antibiotics and had decreased virulence in a Drosophila infection model. These results highlight the important roles of non-essential proteins in PG synthesis in natural environments, such as a host.
 Burkholderia pseudomallei is a bacterium that can cause a difficult-to-manage disease called melioidosis. Even with proper diagnosis and prompt treatment, the fatality rate for melioidosis patients can range from 10-40%. Surprisingly little is known about how B. pseudomallei infects, invades, and survives within its hosts, and virtually nothing is known about the contribution of critical nutrients such as iron to the bacterium's pathogenesis. In this study, we deleted the major siderophore malleobactin and pyochelin gene clusters in strain 1710b and revealed a residual siderophore activity that was unrelated to other known Burkholderia siderophores such as cepabactin and cepaciachelin, and not due to increased secretion of chelators such as citrate. Deletion of the two hemin uptake loci, hmu and hem, showed that Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin and that Hem cannot complement a Hmu deficiency. Prolonged incubation of a hmu hem mutant in hemoglobin-containing minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin. Lactoferrin utilization was dependent on malleobactin, but not pyochelin synthesis and/or uptake. A mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and upon intranasal infection was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. These data suggest that B. pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth.
 Metabolic models are used to understand and predict cellular function. However, these models are often inconsistent and incomplete, making it difficult to use them for analysis. COMMGEN is a tool that automatically identifies and resolves inconsistencies between metabolic models, allowing for more accurate and comprehensive representations of metabolism. We tested COMMGEN on four organisms and found that the resulting consensus models were more coherent and predictive than the original models. COMMGEN is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation is not feasible, such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.
 The human genome contains approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes, but scientists estimate that there are many more non-coding genes that do not encode proteins. These non-coding genes are thought to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes and play important roles in many biological processes. The ENCODE Project is a large-scale effort to identify and characterize these non-coding genes and their functions. The project has identified thousands of non-coding genes that are important for regulating gene expression and have potential roles in disease. The ENCODE Project has also developed new technologies and methods for studying non-coding genes, which will be useful for future research.
 In this study, we investigated the role of Topoisomerase II (Top2) in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster females. We found that knockdown of Top2 by RNAi in the later stages of meiosis resulted in a specific defect in the separation of heterochromatic regions after spindle assembly. In Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, heterochromatic regions often failed to separate during prometaphase I and metaphase I. Additionally, we observed defects in biorientation and the inability of achiasmate chromosomes to move towards the spindle poles during prometaphase I. These data suggest that Topoisomerase II is involved in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I and that these entanglements must be resolved in order to complete meiosis.
Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a serious zoonotic disease that affects humans and dogs. It is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum and transmitted by the bite of sand flies. The disease is endemic in many parts of the world, including Brazil. Current control measures for VL include early diagnosis and treatment of human cases, reduction of sand fly populations, serological surveys of dogs, and euthanasia of seropositive dogs. However, these measures have limitations and do not prevent the spread of the disease. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of community-wide use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in dogs as a public health measure to control and prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis ( CVL ). We implemented an interventional study in two endemic areas in the district of Monte Gordo ( Bahia-Brazil ) : an intervention area, in which VL seronegative dogs were collared, and a control area in which only conventional CVL control measures were applied. We found that the use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars significantly reduced the seroprevalence of CVL in the intervention area, while the seroprevalence in the control area increased. Our results suggest that the use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars is an effective strategy for the control of CVL in endemic areas.
 X chromosomes are unusual in many ways, including their non-random gene content. We propose a new model to explain this bias: the "weak X" or "traffic jam" model. This model suggests that the X chromosome is not a tolerable environment for genes with very high maximal levels of expression, owing to transcriptional traffic jams. We test this model using data from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project. Our results show that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes, and that autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. We also find that highly expressed tissue-specific genes are rare on the X and that broadly expressed genes on the X tend to be lowly expressed. These trends cannot be fully accounted for in terms of alternative models of biased expression. In conclusion, the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, provides a simple yet robustly supported rationale of many peculiar features of X’s gene content, gene expression, and evolution.
 Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that lives in the stomach and is associated with gastric diseases. It is thought to have originated in Africa and has evolved into different populations over time. The authors investigated the prevalence and population structure of H . pylori in Baka Pygmies in Cameroon, a subgroup of Western Pygmies. They found that the prevalence of H . pylori infection in Baka Pygmies was much lower than in their agriculturalist neighbors. The authors also found that the H . pylori population in Baka Pygmies did not define a new population and that the Baka acquired their H . pylori infections from their agriculturalist neighbors. The authors suggest that the low prevalence of H . pylori infection in Baka Pygmies may be due to their small population size and other demographic factors.
 Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The DENV genome is a single-stranded RNA molecule that encodes for 11 proteins. One of these proteins, NS5, is the most highly conserved among the viral non-structural proteins and is responsible for capping, methylation, and replication of the flavivirus RNA genome. DENV2 NS5 localizes to the nucleus during infection, but the role of this localization is not clear. In this study, the authors used a combination of functional and structural analyses to determine the role of NS5 localization in DENV replication and pathogenesis. They found that the C-terminal 18 residues of NS5 are responsible for its nuclear localization and that mutations to this region affect its ability to replicate the viral RNA. The authors also found that the C-terminal region of NS5 plays an evolutionarily conserved role in RNA interactions that are critical for replication. Their findings suggest that the nuclear localization of NS5 may be important for DENV replication and pathogenesis.
 Neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) are a group of parasitic and bacterial infections that affect over 2 billion people worldwide. These diseases are often found in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to healthcare. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has set targets for the control and elimination of several NTDs, but many countries lack the necessary data to plan and implement effective control programs. To address this issue, we developed an integrated mapping protocol ( Integrated Threshold Mapping ( ITM ) Methodology ) for lymphatic filariasis ( LF ), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ). The ITM methodology is designed to be resource-efficient and aims to determine whether a threshold to trigger public health interventions has been reached in an implementation unit. The protocol relies on WHO-recommended indicators in disease-specific age groups and uses the district as the sampling frame for LF, trachoma, and STH, while the sub-district is used for schistosomiasis. We tested the ITM methodology in one district each in Mali and Senegal by comparing it to the standard WHO methodologies for each of the targeted diseases. Our results showed that the ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM methodology was practical, feasible, and demonstrated an overall cost saving compared with the standard, non-integrated, WHO methodologies. This integrated mapping tool could facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries.
 In yeast, the protein Cdc14 is required for the exit from mitosis. It is anchored on nucleolar chromatin by the protein Cfi1/Net1 until early anaphase, when it is released into the nucleoplasm. Two redundant pathways promote Cdc14 release: the FEAR ( Cdc fourteen early release ) network and the MEN ( mitotic exit network ). Through genetic interactions, we report here a novel requirement for the ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase in the cell cycle–dependent release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin when the MEN is inactivated. This function for H2B ubiquitination is mediated by its activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 ( meH3K4 and meH3K79 ) but, surprisingly, is not dependent on the histone deacetylase Sir2, which associates with Cdc14 on nucleolar chromatin as part of the RENT complex. We also observed a defect in Cdc14 release in cells lacking H3 lysine 36 methylation ( meH3K36 ) and in cells lacking an HDAC recruited by this modification. These histone modifications represent previously unappreciated factors required for the accessibility to and/or action on nucleolar chromatin of FEAR network components. The nonredundant role for these modifications in this context contrasts with the notion of a highly combinatorial code by which histone marks act to control biological processes.
 Gene expression programs are sets of co-expressed genes that orchestrate normal or pathological processes. The identification of these programs is a major challenge in computational biology, especially when using human expression data. We developed a new unsupervised computational framework, GeneProgram, that simultaneously organizes tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior. Using synthetic and real gene expression data, we showed that GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. We applied GeneProgram to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents or immune-modulating molecules. We discovered a set of biologically interpretable expression programs and characterized their functional breadth. These programs implicated surprising signaling pathways or receptor types in the response to infection. Our method is multipurpose and can be applied readily to novel compendia of biological data.
 The study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive features observed in innate cells, specifically NK cells. The authors found that only NKG2Chi NK cells, which are found in HCMV seropositive individuals, underwent epigenetic remodeling of the IFNG locus, leading to enhanced IFN-γ production. This suggests that NKG2Chi NK cells may represent a subset of NK cells with memory-like properties. The study provides important insights into the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells.
 The bacterium Legionella pneumophila causes Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia. The bacterium is able to infect and replicate within a wide variety of eukaryotic cells, including human cells. The bacterium uses a type IV secretion system to translocate effector proteins into host cells, where they manipulate host cellular processes to promote bacterial replication. One such effector protein, LubX, is a U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that translocates into host cells and polyubiquitinates a host kinase, Clk1. However, the function of this polyubiquitination is unknown. Interestingly, the expression and translocation of LubX is induced upon infection and the levels of LubX within host cells come to maximum at later stages of infection, compared to other L. pneumophila effectors. The gene encoding LubX is in close proximity to genes that encode several other type IV effectors, including VipD and SidH. Surprisingly, analyses of these effector proteins led to the identification of SidH as a target of LubX. LubX acts as a negative temporal regulator of SidH within host cells. This is the first example of a bacterial effector that targets and regulates a cognate effector within the host cells. The designation "metaeffector" is proposed for this class of bacterial effectors.
 HIV-1 is a highly variable virus that rapidly evolves in response to host immune responses. In this study, we analyzed the diversification of HIV-1 env coding sequences in 81 very early B subtype infections. We found evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 and identified a subset of codon sites that diversified more rapidly than can be explained by a model of neutral evolution. These rapidly diversifying sites were either clustered and embedded in CTL epitopes or in a nucleotide context indicative of APOBEC-mediated G-to-A substitutions. We also examined the distribution, extent, and sequence context of insertions and deletions and provide evidence that the length variation seen in hypervariable loop regions of the envelope glycoprotein is a consequence of selection and not of mutational hotspots. Our results provide a detailed view of the process of diversification of HIV-1 following transmission and highlight the role of CTL escape and hypermutation in shaping viral evolution during the establishment of new infections.
 We introduce and analyze a minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast, built upon known biomolecular interactions in the system. Doing so, we identify the epigenetic marks essential for the bistability of epigenetic states. The model explicitly incorporates two key chromatin marks, H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores whether the presence of multiple marks lead to a qualitatively different systems behavior. We find that having both modifications is important for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. Besides the silenced and transcriptionally active fate of chromatin, our model leads to a novel state with bivalent (i.e., both active and silencing) marks under certain perturbations (knock-out mutations, inhibition or enhancement of enzymatic activity). The design principles of the silencing system is systematically investigated and disparate experimental observations are assessed within a single theoretical framework. Specifically, we discuss the behavior of Sir protein recruitment, spreading and stability of silenced regions in commonly-studied mutants (e.g., sas2, dot1) illuminating the controversial role of Dot1 in the systems biology of yeast silencing.
 Severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) is a major health problem in many developing countries, affecting millions of children. SAM can manifest as either oedematous or non-oedematous malnutrition, with oedematous malnutrition being the most severe form, also known as kwashiorkor. The pathogenesis of both types of malnutrition in children remains largely unknown, but recent studies have linked gut microbiota ( GM ) dysbiosis to oedematous malnutrition. In this study, we aimed to assess whether GM composition differs between Ugandan children suffering from either oedematous or non-oedematous malnutrition. We found that non-oedematous SAM children have lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children, but no clear compositional differences were identified. Our results suggest that GM diversity may be a factor in the development of the two clinical phenotypes of SAM.
 Telomeres are the ends of chromosomes that protect them from degradation and fusion. Telomere length varies among individuals and is controlled by multiple loci. In a study of 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates, we found extensive telomere length variation in S. paradoxus isolates. This variation correlated with their geographic origin: European strains had extremely short telomeres, while American isolates had telomeres approximately three times as long. We used insertions of a URA3 gene near telomeres to accurately analyze individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect (TPE). Crossing the American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telomere lengths consistent with what would be predicted if many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were involved in length maintenance. We detected transgressive segregation for both phenotypes. We validated by reciprocal hemizygosity that YKU80 and TLC1 are telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. Furthermore, we propose that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis within one of the allelic combinations, resulting in very short telomeres. Our study provides insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying telomere length variation in S. paradoxus.
 We have developed a new sequential sampling model ( SSM ) that accounts for the possibility of a decision not to decide. This is important because people often delay their decisions until they have more information, and this can affect the timing of their responses. We tested our model using data from two studies that involved participants making decisions about buying or rejecting stocks based on sequential information. We found that our model accurately predicted the timing of participants' responses, and that it was able to account for the fact that participants often delayed their decisions. We also used time-frequency analysis of EEG data to show that the decision not to decide was associated with an increase in oscillatory power in the beta band, which is a well-established neural marker of the active inhibition of motor responses. Finally, we tested our model experimentally in an adapted version of our task, and found that it accurately predicted the timing of participants' responses. Overall, our results show how computational modeling of decisions and response times can provide a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition.
 Hereditary nasal parakeratosis ( HNPK ) is a skin disorder that affects the nasal planum of Labrador Retrievers . It is caused by a mutation in the SUV39H2 gene, which encodes a histone 3 lysine 9 ( H3K9 ) methyltransferase . This mutation causes a change in an evolutionarily conserved asparagine into a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme ( p . N324K ) . The HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes . Our data provide evidence that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis .
 Influenza A viruses ( IAVs ) are negative-strand RNA viruses with eight gene segments of various lengths . IAV subtypes are determined by the virus surface glycoproteins , hemagglutinin ( HA ) , and neuraminidase ( NA ) . IAVs with subtypes H1–H16 and N1–N9 have been identified . IAVs can cause infections in birds , marine mammals , land-based lower mammals ( e . g . , pigs , dogs , and horses ) , and humans . Wild birds maintain a large IAV genetic pool , which contributes to the appearance of new IAVs in humans , lower mammals , and domestic poultry . Pigs have both avian-like receptors ( α 2 , 3-linked sialic acid , SA2 , 3Gal ) and human-like receptors ( α 2 , 6-linked sialic acid , SA2 , 6Gal ) on the epithelial cells of their respiratory tissues , making them a proposed “mixing vessel” for generating pandemic IAV strains through genetic reassortment between avian and swine or human IAVs . In this study, we identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants recovered from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues of a group of co-housed pigs ( influenza-seronegative , avian H1N1 IAV–infected , and swine H3N2 IAV–infected pigs ) . We found that reassortants from lower respiratory tracts had the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells , and the cold temperature in swine nasal cells seemed to select the type of reassortant viruses shed by the pigs . One reassortant in nasal wash samples was consistently identified in upper , middle , and lower respiratory tract tissues , and it was confirmed to be transmitted efficiently between pigs . Our findings suggest that during mixed infections of avian and swine IAVs , genetic reassortments are likely to occur in the lower respiratory track , and tissue tropism is an important factor selecting for a transmissible reassortant .
 Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the trematode Schistosoma mansoni. Infection during pregnancy may affect the immune response of the offspring to schistosome infection and schistosomiasis-associated morbidity. In a study in Uganda, we examined the effects of praziquantel treatment of S . mansoni during pregnancy on prevalence of S . mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five years. We found no evidence that maternal S . mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence and intensity of S . mansoni infection or effector immune response to S . mansoni infection among offspring at age five years. However, we observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA, suggesting that maternal S . mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This might have implications for pathogenesis of the disease.
 Macrophages are important cells in the immune system that help fight infections. When macrophages are activated by inflammatory stimuli, they can internalize and destroy pathogens more efficiently. However, the exact mechanism by which macrophages are activated and how they internalize and destroy pathogens is not well understood. In this study, the authors found that inflammatory stimuli cause macrophages to switch from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, a non-saturable mode of uptake that allows the internalization of large amounts of cargo independent of any receptor usage. The authors also found that this switch is regulated by the phosphorylation of a protein called coronin 1, which is activated by protein kinase C. Together, these findings provide a new understanding of how macrophages are activated and how they internalize and destroy pathogens.
 The study aimed to assess knowledge, perceptions, and acceptance of tsetse baits (traps, targets) in villages where they had or had not been used previously. The study was conducted in 8 villages across Arua District in Uganda. The results showed that despite their proximity, acceptance of traps varied markedly between villages and was related to the duration of experience with tsetse control programs. The study highlights the importance of early engagements with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns to ensure acceptance of tsetse control interventions. The findings can be applied to other vector-borne and neglected tropical diseases.
 Recombination is a fundamental biological process that plays a crucial role in the evolution of species. In this study, we used high-resolution whole-genome recombination maps to investigate the evolutionary consequences of recombination in Drosophila melanogaster. We generated whole-genome CO and GC maps from eight crosses between natural strains of D. melanogaster. Our maps revealed extreme and highly punctuated variation in CO rates along chromosomes, with hot and coldspots. We also found extensive intra-specific variation in CO landscapes that is associated with hotspots at low frequency in our sample. GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. Our high-resolution whole-genome recombination maps provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the evolutionary consequences of recombination due to exposure to identical demographic and environmental factors. Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple layers of variation in recombination rates when analyzing population genetic data.
 DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation is maintained by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. The IDN2/RDM12 gene has been previously identified as a component of the RdDM machinery in Arabidopsis, but its function in the pathway remains unknown. In this study, we used affinity purification to identify two IDN2 paralogs, IDP1 and IDP2. We found that the previously uncharacterized IDN2 XH domain is required for the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex formation as well as for IDN2 function. IDP1 is required for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing, whereas IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1. Unlike IDN2, IDP1 and IDP2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting that their roles in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex are different from those of IDN2 in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex and that IDP1 and IDP2 are essential for the functioning of the complex in RdDM.
 Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to the sites of Leishmania inoculation . During Leishmania braziliensis infection, depletion of inflammatory cells significantly increases the parasite load whereas co-inoculation of neutrophils plus L . braziliensis had an opposite effect . Moreover, the co-culture of infected macrophages and neutrophils also induced parasite killing leading us to ask how neutrophils alone respond to an L . braziliensis exposure . Herein we focused on understanding the interaction between neutrophils and L . braziliensis, exploring cell activation and apoptotic fate. Inoculation of serum-opsonized L . braziliensis promastigotes in mice induced neutrophil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 h. In vitro, exposure of thyoglycollate-elicited inflammatory or bone marrow neutrophils to L . braziliensis modulated the expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62L, and induced the oxidative burst. Using mCherry-expressing L . braziliensis, we determined that such effects were mainly observed in infected and not in bystander cells. Neutrophil activation following contact with L . braziliensis was also confirmed by the release of TNF-α and neutrophil elastase. Lastly, neutrophils infected with L . braziliensis but not with L . major displayed markers of early apoptosis. We show that L . braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact on parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection.
 Bovine tuberculosis ( bTB ) is a major problem for cattle farmers and governments worldwide. Vaccination is a promising tool to control bTB, but it is currently not used in any international control program because it interferes with the action of the tuberculin skin test, which is used to determine if animals, herds, and countries are officially bTB-free. New diagnostic tests that Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals ( DIVA ) offer the potential to introduce vaccination within existing eradication programs. We use within-herd transmission models estimated from historical data from Great Britain ( GB ) to explore the feasibility of supplemental use of BCG vaccination. We find that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than the sensitivity, is the greatest barrier to seeing a herd level benefit of vaccination. We estimate that a DIVA specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective herd level benefit of vaccination with no increase in the risk of restrictions being imposed. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest that this target specificity could be achieved in vaccinates using a cocktail of three DIVA antigens while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% ( 95%CI: 61.9 , 82.9% ) relative to post-mortem detection. Using our models, we explore the range of the DIVA test characteristics necessary to see a protective herd level benefit of vaccination. We estimate that a DIVA specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective herd level benefit of vaccination with no increase in the risk of missed infection. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest that this target specificity could be achieved in vaccinates using a cocktail of three DIVA antigens while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% ( 95%CI: 61.9 , 82.9% ) relative to post-mortem detection.
 Trichuriasis is a common parasitic infection that affects millions of people worldwide. Current treatments are limited and often fail to eradicate the infection. In this study, researchers screened a library of 480 small molecules for compounds that paralyze the adult stage of the parasite Trichuris muris in vitro. They identified a new class of molecules called dihydrobenzoxazepinones that are effective against both the adult and egg stages of T. muris. These molecules show promising selectivity for the parasite and could be developed into a new treatment for trichuriasis.
 We present a detailed analysis of the properties of protein interaction networks, focusing on the roles of hubs. We show that the idea of a date/party dichotomy for hubs is not supported by the data, and that the observed differences in network vulnerability to attacks on date and party hubs are largely due to a small number of particularly important hubs. We also find that there is no clear correlation between the location of a hub on a continuum of network topological characteristics and its expression co-expression with its interaction partners. However, we find that there is a relation between the functional linkage of proteins and the link (interaction) betweenness centrality of the proteins. We suggest that a framework incorporating a more nuanced notion of roles for both nodes and links might provide a better understanding of the organization of the interactome.
 We have developed a new method to estimate the genetic diversity of pathogens in infectious disease outbreaks. This method, called "transmission divergence," measures the number of mutations that have accumulated between pathogen genomes sampled from transmission pairs. We used this method to estimate the transmission divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens, including Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, and Clostridium difficile. We found that the transmission divergence of these pathogens is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. This suggests that genetic sequence data may not provide much information about individual transmission events in these outbreaks. However, our results also highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of each pathogen when interpreting genetic sequence data in outbreak reconstruction.
 X chromosome inactivation ( XCI ) is a process in which one of the two X chromosomes is randomly silenced in female mammals to balance the dosage of X-linked genes. In this study, the authors used RNA-seq to analyze the allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI. They found that few genes escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro system represented by the embryonic-kidney-derived Patski cell line showed a higher density of escape genes. The authors also found that allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase I hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on the Xi correlated well with levels of escape, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes. They also found that allele-specific CTCF binding on the Xi clustered at escape genes and was denser in brain compared to the Patski cell line. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of XCI and its regulation in different tissues.
 VX-4 is a novel cysteine protease of P. vivax that has been characterized. It has dual substrate specificity depending on the surrounding micro-environmental pH. Its hydrolyzing activity against Z-Leu-Arg-MCA and Z-Phe-Arg-MCA was highest at acidic pH ( 5.5 ), whereas that against Z-Arg-Arg-MCA was maximal at neutral pH ( 6.5-7.5 ). VX-4 preferred positively charged amino acids and Gln at the P1 position, with less strict specificity at P3 and P4. P2 preferences depended on pH ( Leu at pH 5.5 and Arg at pH 7.5 ). Three amino acids that delineate the S2 pocket were substituted in VX-4 compared to VX-2 and VX-3 ( Ala90 , Gly157 and Glu180 ). Replacement of Glu180 abolished activity against Z-Arg-Arg-MCA at neutral pH, indicating the importance of this amino acid in the pH-dependent substrate preference. VX-4 was localized in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax. VX-4 showed maximal activity against actin at neutral pH, and that against P. vivax plasmepsin 4 and hemoglobin was detected at neutral/acidic and acidic pH, respectively. VX-4 demonstrates pH-dependent substrate switching, which might offer an efficient mechanism for the specific cleavage of different substrates in different intracellular environments. VX-4 might function as a hemoglobinase in the acidic parasite food vacuole, a maturase of P. vivax plasmepsin 4 at neutral or acidic pH, and a cytoskeleton-degrading protease in the neutral erythrocyte cytosol.
 Acetogens are microorganisms that can convert waste gases into multi-carbon commodities. The Wood-Ljungdahlii pathway (WLP) is the only known CO2-fixing pathway coupled to energy conservation. A new genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) has been developed for the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. The model captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways as well as pathways to synthesis RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model accurately predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycerol during changing carbon and metal availability and revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in this model acetogen. The model provides new inroads for advanced engineering designs.
 In this study, we used a panel of human osteoblasts ( HObs ) to carry out a transcriptomic survey, similar to recent studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ). We performed cis-association analysis with SNP genotypes to identify genetic variations of transcript isoforms, and our analysis indicates that differential expression of transcript isoforms in HObs is also partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. We examined the top SNPs from a GWAS of bone mineral density and found overlap with probeset associations observed in this study. Our approach to examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types is useful for detecting the proportion of genetic variation common to different cell types and for the identification of cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant. We selected one example ( FAM118A ) from the overlapping hits for follow-up fine-mapping studies, which revealed a novel transcript isoform with potential functional importance in bone biology.
Saccharomyces eubayanus is a non-S. cerevisiae parent of the lager-brewing hybrid S. pastorianus. In contrast to most S. cerevisiae and Frohberg-type S. pastorianus strains, S. eubayanus cannot utilize the α-tri-glucoside maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort. In Saccharomyces yeasts, utilization of maltotriose is encoded by the subtelomeric MAL gene family, and requires transporters for maltotriose uptake. While S. eubayanus strain CBS 12357T harbors four SeMALT genes which enable uptake of the α-di-glucoside maltose, it lacks maltotriose transporter genes. In this study, we subjected laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort to S. eubayanus strain CBS 12357T. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMalT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose, indicating gene neofunctionalization had occurred. The mosaic structure of SeMalT413 resembles the structure of S. pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequences identity to alternatingly S. cerevisiae MALx1, S. paradoxus MALx1 and S. eubayanus SeMALT3. Evolution of the maltotriose transporter landscape in hybrid S. pastorianus lager-brewing strains is therefore likely to have involved mechanisms similar to those observed in the present study.
 The variants of human influenza virus have caused substantial morbidity and mortality. In this study, we have established a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by viral strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each (sub) type of seasonal influenza viruses. Based on this relationship, we further developed a method to rapidly assess the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between A (H1N1) strains. Rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden for new seasonal strains should help formulate a cost-effective response for influenza control and prevention.
 The Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is a major threat to soybean production worldwide. To understand how this fungus interacts with its host plant, we characterized a small, secreted cysteine-rich protein (SSCRP) called PpEC23. We found that PpEC23 suppresses plant immunity by interacting with a soybean transcription factor called GmSPL12l. This interaction leads to the suppression of basal defense responses and the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death. Our findings provide new insights into how rust fungi manipulate host immune systems and suggest that PpEC23 could be a target for the development of new soybean rust resistance strategies.
 In this study, we identified the cell surface tyrosine kinase EphrinA2 receptor ( EphA2 ) as a chlamydial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3 kinase activation, promoting chlamydial replication. Interfering with binding of C . trachomatis serovar L2 ( Ctr ) to EphA2 , downregulation of EphA2 expression or inhibition of EphA2 activity significantly reduced Ctr infection. Ctr interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface resulting in Ctr and receptor internalization. During chlamydial replication, EphA2 remains active accumulating around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that is required for normal chlamydial development. Overexpression of full length EphA2, but not the mutant form lacking the intracellular cytoplasmic domain, enhanced PI3K activation and Ctr infection. Despite the depletion of EphA2 from the cell surface, Ctr infection induces upregulation of EphA2 through the activation of the ERK pathway, which keeps the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. The significance of EphA2 as an entry and intracellular signaling receptor was also observed with the urogenital C . trachomatis-serovar D. Our findings provide the first evidence for a host cell surface receptor that is exploited for invasion as well as for receptor-mediated intracellular signaling to facilitate chlamydial replication. In addition, the engagement of a cell surface receptor at the inclusion membrane is a new mechanism by which Chlamydia subverts the host cell and induces apoptosis resistance.
 Neurons have extensive dendritic trees that receive and process information from many synapses. The presence of active conductances in dendrites has been shown to be important for dendritic excitability, but the functional role of this excitability is not clear. Here, we propose that the main role of active dendritic conductances is to enhance the dynamic range of the neuron. We model a dendritic tree as a binary tree with many excitable branchlets and show that the average output of the model is a highly non-linear function of the afferent rate, with dynamic ranges above 50 dB. We predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic ranges and that blocking of active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range. Our results suggest that dendritic spikes, which have been observed experimentally, could be responsible for a double-sigmoid response function in retinal ganglion cells. We propose that neurons have active dendrites because they need to work with a large stimulus range.
 The inference of regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data has been extensively studied and applied to a range of problems in drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. However, the commonly-made assumptions on the biological processes under study are often not valid. In this study, we systematically investigate the importance of these assumptions and possible corrections using a combination of models and experiments. We measure in real time and in vivo the activity of genes involved in the FliA-FlgM module of the E . coli motility network. From these data, we estimate protein concentrations and global physiological effects by means of kinetic models of gene expression. Our results indicate that correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. Moreover, we show by simulation that these improvements are expected to be even stronger for systems in which protein concentrations have longer half-lives and the activity of the gene expression machinery varies more strongly across conditions than in the FliA-FlgM module. The approach proposed in this study is broadly applicable when using time-series transcriptome data to learn about the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks. In the case of the FliA-FlgM module, our results demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.
 The study aimed to characterize the landscape distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulvescens (O . fulvescens), an important mammalian reservoir in Central America. The study was conducted in the community of Agua Buena in Tonosí, Panama, between April 2006 and December 2009. The results showed that O . fulvescens typically was locally absent during the late transitional months of the season and re-established in subsequent years. These populations re-occurred in the same area during the first three years but subsequently re-established further south in the final year of the study. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that local populations encompassed approximately 300–600 m. The borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances. Oligoryzomys fulvescens showed a well-defined spatial pattern that evolved over time, and led to a pattern of changing aggregation. These findings help explain the intermittent risk from pathogens transmitted by this species. The variation was associated with seasonality, as well as anthropogenic pressures that occurred with agricultural activities. These factors help define the characteristics of the occurrence, timing, intensity, and duration of synanthropic populations affected by human populations and consequently possible exposure that local human populations experience.
 Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health and are constantly evolving to evade pre-existing host immunity. To monitor genetic and antigenic changes, the World Health Organization runs a global surveillance program. Quantification of viral antigenic phenotypes is done with the hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) assay, which measures the ability of an antiserum to inhibit the agglutination of red blood cells by a viral antigen. Antigenic cartography, involving multidimensional scaling of log-normalized HI titers, generates an accurate low-dimensional representation of the antigenic distances between antigen–antiserum pairs. However, computational methods for directly determining the antigenic impact of individual amino acid exchanges do not yet exist. We have developed a method for inferring ‘antigenic trees’ for the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin. In the antigenic tree, antigenic weights are assigned to all tree branches, allowing us to resolve the antigenic impact of the associated amino acid changes. Our technique predicted antigenic distances with comparable accuracy to antigenic cartography and identified both known and novel sites and amino acid changes with antigenic impact in the evolution of influenza A ( H3N2 ) viruses from 1968 to 2003. The technique can also be applied for inference of ‘phenotype trees’ and genotype–phenotype relationships from other types of pairwise phenotype distances.
 Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is a common cause of cervical cancer. HPV infection occurs in the basal layer of the cervical epithelium and progresses to the upper layers as the cells differentiate. HPV replication and assembly occur in the nucleus of differentiated cells. HPV entry into host cells involves several steps, including binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ), endocytosis, and transport to late endosomes or endolysosomes. The viral DNA ( vDNA ) and L2 dissociate from the capsid in endosomal compartments and move to the Golgi complex. After penetration into the cytosol, the vDNA moves complexed with L2 into the nucleus and eventually localizes to ND10 nuclear domains. However, it is unclear which entry step is influenced by cell cycle progression. In this study, a two-step, high-throughput RNAi silencing screen was used to identify host cell factors required during HPV16 infection. The results revealed a previously undetermined mechanism for import of the viral DNA into the nucleus. HPV16 requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for access of the vDNA to the nucleoplasm. The results accentuate the value of genes found by RNAi screens for investigation of viral infections. The list of cell functions required during HPV16 infection will provide a resource for future virus-host cell interaction studies.
 The fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis causes Black Sigatoka disease in banana plants, which is a major threat to global banana production. The disease is managed by frequent fungicide applications, but this leads to the evolution of fungicide-resistant strains. To better understand the disease and develop new methods for disease management, the genomes of two isolates of P. fijiensis were sequenced and analyzed. The genomes were found to be highly expanded by LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. The genomes of two closely related members of the Sigatoka disease complex, P. musae and P. eumusae, were also found to be expanded. The genomes were analyzed for genetic diversity and differentiation, and frequencies of fungicide resistance in fungicide-treated plantations were much higher than those in untreated wild-type P. fijiensis populations. A homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector was identified in the P. fijiensis genome. Infiltration of the purified PfAVR4 protein into leaves of the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4 resulted in a hypersensitive-like response, suggesting that Calcutta 4 could carry an unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAVR4. The results of this study will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules to combat this pathogen and in improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs.
 The evolution of lineage-specific traits is thought to be driven by changes in gene regulation, including transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). However, most computational approaches to study regulatory elements focus on highly conserved sites and rely heavily on multiple sequence alignments. In this study, we developed a novel framework that uses a birth-death model to trace the evolution of lineage-specific binding sites without relying on detailed base-by-base cross-species alignments. We applied our model to analyze the evolution of binding sites for six transcription factors along the lineage toward human after human-mouse common ancestor. We estimate that a substantial fraction of binding sites (58-79%) in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse. Over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. Such elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. These results support the ability of our method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and help understand their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species.
 The circadian clock is a biological mechanism that regulates the timing of various physiological processes in response to environmental cues, such as light. In mammals, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which receives light signals from the retina. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the circadian clock is distributed throughout the body, and some tissues can be directly entrained by light. In zebrafish, the circadian clock is present in many tissues and cell lines, and can be entrained by light. The zebrafish per2 gene is a negative component of the circadian oscillator and is involved in the entrainment of the circadian clock by light. In this study, we identified a Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the zebrafish per2 promoter that is necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian clock regulation. We also demonstrated that the human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells. Our results suggest that a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. These findings extend our understanding of the mechanism whereby the clock is entrained by light and how the regulation of clock gene expression by light has evolved in vertebrates.
 In this study, the authors investigate the role of the actin filament-binding protein coronin in the motility of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes.  The authors show that coronin regulates gliding motility in sporozoites, which is required for efficient transmission from mosquitoes to mice.  The authors also suggest a switch in signaling pathways linking calcium- and cAMP- mediated signaling during migration and invasion.  Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms of parasite motility and transmission.
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites. Amphotericin B (AmB) is a drug used to treat leishmaniasis. However, the emergence of resistance to AmB is a concern. In this study, we characterized four AmB-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines. We found that all lines had altered sterol biosynthesis and were hypersensitive to pentamidine. Whole genome sequencing revealed resistance-associated mutation of sterol C5-desaturase in one line, while loss of expression of sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT) was associated with three lines. We also found loss of the miltefosine transporter in one of the lines. SMT is encoded by two tandem gene copies, which we found to have very different expression levels. In all cases, reduced overall expression was associated with loss of the 3’ untranslated region of the dominant gene copy, resulting from structural variations at this locus. We also found local regions of sequence homology between the gene copies themselves and also due to the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements that promote multi-gene amplification. Our findings suggest that structural variations at the SMT locus may contribute to AmB resistance in Leishmania parasites.
 The brain is constantly processing information from the environment and making predictions about what will happen next. When these predictions are wrong, the brain needs to update its model of the environment. This process is thought to be optimized by two main mechanisms: prediction and attention. Prediction is the process of using stored information to make predictions about what will happen next, while attention is the process of focusing on certain parts of the environment. These two mechanisms are thought to work together to optimize information processing in the brain. In this study, researchers used electroencephalography ( EEG ) to measure the neural activity of human observers as they performed a simple visual task. The researchers found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that contained information related to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention increased the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. These findings support the idea that attention and prediction work together to optimize information processing in the brain.
 Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans. There are three subspecies of T. brucei, and two of them, T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense, are able to infect humans. T. b. gambiense is divided into two groups, group 1 and group 2, which differ in their human serum resistance phenotypes. Group 1 T. b. gambiense is resistant to trypanosome lytic factor 1 (TLF-1) due to reduced uptake of TLF-1 mediated by reduced expression of the TLF-1 receptor (HpHbR) gene. However, group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to TLF-1, which could be based on the same mechanism. Group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays this phenotype and expression does not appear to correlate with a change in expression site or expression of HpHbR. Thus, there are differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between T. b. gambiense groups 1 and 2.
 DNA methylation of retroviral promoters and enhancers localized in the provirus 5′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is considered to be a mechanism of transcriptional suppression that allows retroviruses to evade host immune responses and antiretroviral drugs . However, the role of DNA methylation in the control of HIV-1 latency has never been unambiguously demonstrated, in contrast to the apparent importance of transcriptional interference and chromatin structure, and has never been studied in HIV-1-infected patients. Here, we show in an in vitro model of reactivable latency and in a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an additional epigenetic restriction mechanism, which controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals and thus determines the stability of the HIV-1 latency. CpG methylation acts as a late event during establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for the initial provirus silencing. Indeed, the latent reservoir of some aviremic patients contained high proportions of the non-methylated 5′ LTR. The latency controlled solely by transcriptional interference and by chromatin-dependent mechanisms in the absence of significant promoter DNA methylation tends to be leaky and easily reactivable. In the latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected individuals without detectable plasma viremia, we found HIV-1 promoters and enhancers to be hypermethylated and resistant to reactivation, as opposed to the hypomethylated 5′ LTR in viremic patients. However, even dense methylation of the HIV-1 5′LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation of latent HIV-1 with some histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein kinase C agonists, TNF-α, and their combinations with 5-aza-2deoxycytidine: the densely methylated HIV-1 promoter was most efficiently reactivated in virtual absence of T cell activation by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. Tight but incomplete control of HIV-1 latency by CpG methylation might have important implications for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1 infection.
 The study presents a comprehensive catalog of genetic variants in 39 Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel inbred lines. The authors used an integrative approach for variant discovery and identified more than 3.6 million distinct variants, including more than 800,000 unique insertions, deletions, and complex variants. The study also provides insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in adult flies by mapping cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) for more than 2,000 genes. The authors found that indels comprise around 10% of all cis-eQTLs and show larger effects than SNP cis-eQTLs. In addition, the study identified two-fold more gene associations in males as compared to females and found that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific. Finally, the study performed RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses in the offspring of crosses between sequenced lines, which revealed that the majority of strong cis-eQTLs can be validated in heterozygous individuals. The study provides valuable insights into the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation in Drosophila.
 The rectified surface EMG signal is commonly used to estimate the neural drive to muscles and therefore to infer sources of synaptic input to motor neurons . However, the overlap of motor unit action potentials ( amplitude cancellation ) may distort the spectrum of the rectified EMG and thereby its correlation with the neural drive. In this study, we investigated the impact of amplitude cancelation on this correlation using analytical derivations and a computational model of motor neuron activity, force, and the EMG signal. We demonstrated that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation ( EMGnc ) is superior to the actual rectified EMG signal as estimator of the neural drive. This observation was confirmed by the simulations, as the average coefficient of determination ( r2 ) between the neural drive in the 1–30 Hz band and EMGnc ( 0 . 59±0 . 08 ) was matched by the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive only when the level of amplitude cancellation was low ( <40% ) at low contraction levels ( <5% of maximum voluntary contraction force; MVC ) . This correlation, however, decreased linearly with amplitude cancellation ( r = -0 . 83 ) to values of r2 <0 . 2 at amplitude cancellation levels >60% ( contraction levels >15% MVC ) . Moreover, the simulations showed that a stronger ( i . e . more variable ) neural drive implied a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive and that amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components ( <5 Hz ) of the neural drive. In conclusion, the results indicate that amplitude cancellation distorts the spectrum of the rectified EMG signal. This implies that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.
 Aluminum (Al) is a common soil contaminant that inhibits root growth in acidic soils. The molecular mechanism controlling this inhibition is largely unknown. In this study, we found that YUCCA (YUC), which encodes flavin monooxygenase-like proteins, regulates local auxin biosynthesis in the root-apex transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. Al stress up-regulates YUC3/5/7/8/9 in the root-apex TZ, which results in the accumulation of auxin in the root-apex TZ and root-growth inhibition during the Al stress response. These Al-dependent changes in the regulation of YUCs in the root-apex TZ and YUC-regulated root growth inhibition are dependent on ethylene signaling. Increasing or disruption of ethylene signaling caused either enhanced or reduced up-regulation, respectively, of YUCs in response to Al stress. In addition, ethylene enhanced root growth inhibition under Al stress was strongly alleviated in yuc mutants or by co-treatment with yucasin, an inhibitor of YUC activity, suggesting a downstream role of YUCs in this process. Moreover, ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) is involved in the direct regulation of YUC9 transcription in this process. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) functions as a transcriptional activator for YUC5/8/9. PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating the local expression of YUCs and auxin signal in the root-apex TZ. The Al–induced expression of PIF4 in root TZ acts downstream of ethylene signaling. Taken together, our results highlight a regulatory cascade for YUCs-regulated local auxin biosynthesis in the root-apex TZ mediating root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.
 In this study, we investigated the functional implications of interactions between two highly polymorphic molecules, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( KIRs ) on NK cells and their major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I ligands on target cells, in the context of simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) infection in rhesus macaques. We found that certain SIV peptides bound by MHC class I molecules can suppress the cytolytic activity of primary NK cells expressing the inhibitory KIR3DL05. These peptides can also inhibit SIV replication in lymphocytes expressing the same MHC class I molecule. These results suggest that viruses may acquire changes in epitopes that enhance MHC class I binding to inhibitory KIRs to evade NK cell killing. This study provides a mechanism by which immunodeficiency viruses may escape NK cell responses.
 Bacterial pathogens must adapt to survive in a variety of environments, including nutrient-limited conditions.  In this study, we found that Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHI ) adapts to nutrient-limited conditions by mutating the icc gene, which encodes a 3' , 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) phosphodiesterase.  This mutation results in decreased cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, which allows NTHI to form more intracellular bacterial communities ( IBCs ) early during experimental otitis media ( OM ).  Although the number of IBCs formed by the parental strain was low at early stages of OM, we observed a significant increase at later stages that coincided with absence of recoverable effusion, suggesting the presence of a mucosal reservoir following resolution of clinical disease.  These data provide the first insight into NTHI microevolution during nutritional limitation and provide the first demonstration of IBCs in a preclinical model of chronic OM.
 The study aimed to investigate the role of iron in the pathogenesis of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis.  The study found that B. pseudomallei has developed strategies to circumvent iron restriction mechanisms of the host.  Alterations in iron homeostasis can influence the course of murine melioidosis.  The study suggests that iron chelating drugs might be an additional therapeutic option for the treatment of melioidosis.  The study highlights the importance of iron in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and the potential of iron chelating drugs as a therapeutic option for the treatment of melioidosis.
 Proteins are complex molecules that perform a wide range of functions in living organisms. These functions are often accomplished through collective motions of the protein. However, identifying these motions and their relationship to the protein's function can be challenging. In this study, the authors propose a new technique called "functional mode analysis" (FMA) to identify collective motions related to a specific protein function. The technique uses an ensemble of protein structures and a "functional quantity" that quantifies the functional state of the protein. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of FMA by applying it to a variety of biomolecules, including a polyalanine helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein. The results show that FMA can successfully identify functionally relevant collective motions in these proteins.
 Euglenids are a group of eukaryotic organisms that contain nonconventional introns in their nuclear genes. These introns are not removed in the order expected from their position in the transcript, and their removal is not always collinear with the progress of transcription. In this study, the order of intron removal from the transcripts of two euglenid genes, tubA and gapC, was analyzed. The results showed that nonconventional introns are removed in a rapid way but later than spliceosomal introns. The observed accumulation of transcripts with conventional introns removed and nonconventional present may suggest the existence of a time gap between the two types of splicing.
 Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is a common human pathogen that causes a self-limited febrile illness in infants, but can also cause severe inflammatory diseases including myocarditis. Chronic consequences of mild CVB infection are unknown, though there is an epidemiologic association between early subclinical infections and late heart failure. Here, we describe a mouse model of juvenile infection with a subclinical dose of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) which showed no evident symptoms, either immediately following infection or in adult mice. However, following physiological or pharmacologically-induced cardiac stress, juvenile-infected adult mice underwent cardiac hypertrophy and dilation indicative of progression to heart failure. Evaluation of the vasculature in the hearts of adult mice subjected to cardiac stress showed a compensatory increase in CD31+ blood vessel formation, although this effect was suppressed in juvenile-infected mice. Moreover, CVB3 efficiently infected juvenile c-kit+ cells, and cardiac progenitor cell numbers were reduced in the hearts of juvenile-infected adult mice. These results suggest that the exhausted cardiac progenitor cell pool following juvenile CVB3 infection may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density to adapt to increased load.
 The innate immune system is the first line of defense against microbial infection. It is activated in response to invading microbes by the engagement of pattern-recognition receptors ( PRRs ) including membrane-bound Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain ( NOD ) -like receptors ( NLRs ). NLRC4 is a cytosolic NLR that specifically responds to a functional type III ( T3SS ) or type IV ( T4SS ) secretion system either indirectly by detecting flagellin [4]–[6] , [8] , [9] , [14] or directly by detecting T3SS rod proteins through a sequence motif that is also found in flagellin FliC [11] , [15] . The specificity of the NLRC4 inflammasome for different bacterial ligands is determined by its interaction with distinct members of the NAIP ( neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein ) family . Murine NAIP5 and NAIP6 are required for sensing bacterial flagellin in the host cytoplasm , whereas murine NAIP2 specifically detects T3SS inner rod proteins such as PrgJ from Salmonella enterica subspecies Typhimurium ( S . typhimurium ) [13] , [16] . Human NAIP binds to T3SS needle subunits from several bacteria including S . typhimurium PrgI [13] . Moreover , the S . typhimurium T3SS effector protein SopE can activate Rho GTPases and thereby triggers host cell invasion and caspase-1 activation [17] . Caspase-1 cleaves the immature forms of IL-1β and IL-18 prior to their release as biologically active inflammatory cytokines . It also induces pyroptotic cell death , a key innate defence mechanism against intracellular bacteria [18] , [19] . NLRC4-mediated activation of caspase-1 has previously been reported to result in proteolytic processing of caspase-7 during S . typhimurium infection leading to restriction of Legionella replication in infected murine macrophages [20] . Burkholderia pseudomallei is a gram-negative flagellate bacterium that causes melioidosis , a disease endemic to Southeast Asia and northern Australia [22] , [23] . Infection results from subcutaneous inoculation , inhalation or ingestion and may lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations including pneumonia , organ abscesses and septicaemia . B . pseudomallei can invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells , is able to escape from the endocytic vacuole and to replicate in the host cell cytosol by the use of a T3SS3 [23] . Macrophages and interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) are critical for the early control of B . pseudomallei infection [24]–[27] . B . pseudomallei is capable of inducing caspase-1-dependent cell death in murine macrophages [28] . In a previous study we described that this rapid pyroptotic cell death is involved in defence against B . pseudomallei by removing the pathogen's replication niche but caspase-1 contributes to the control of intracellular bacterial replication in macrophages as well [29] . Work by Ceballos-Olvera et al . [12] revealed that B . pseudomallei can activate the caspase-1 inflammasome by both NLRC4 and NLRP3 . NLRC4 mainly regulates pyroptosis , whereas NLRP3 is primarily important for production of IL-1β and IL-18 . IL-1β can play a deleterious role in melioidosis by causing excessive neutrophil recruitment and tissue damage but IL-18 may be protective through induction of IFN-γ production . Furthermore , it has been shown that cytosolic flagellin from closely related but far less virulent B . thailandensis is not able to interact with NAIP5-NLRC4 and to stimulate caspase-1 activation , whereas the T3SS3 inner rod protein BsaK can interact with the NAIP2-NLRC4 inflammasome . Delivery of
 Pollen germination is a crucial step in the process of pollination and fertilization. The process involves a series of regulated events, including pollen adhesion, hydration, and germination on the stigma. However, the internal signaling of pollen that regulates these events is poorly understood. In this study, we found that Arabidopsis KINβγ is a cytoplasm- and nucleus-localized protein in the vegetative cells of pollen grains. The pollen of the Arabidopsis kinβγ mutant could not germinate on stigma, although it germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the hydration of kinβγ mutant pollen on the stigma was compromised. We also found that the kinβγ mutant exhibited reduced levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in pollen. The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen in vivo, suggesting that the compromised hydration of the mutant pollen led to its defective germination. In kinβγ mutant pollen, the structure of the mitochondria and peroxisomes was destroyed, and their numbers were significantly reduced compared with those in the wild type. Furthermore, we found that the kinβγ mutant exhibited reduced levels of ROS in pollen. The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen in vivo, suggesting that the compromised hydration of the mutant pollen led to its defective germination. In kinβγ mutant pollen, the structure of the mitochondria and peroxisomes was destroyed, and their numbers were significantly reduced compared with those in the wild type. Furthermore, we found that the kinβγ mutant exhibited reduced levels of ROS in pollen. The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen in vivo, suggesting that the compromised hydration of the mutant pollen led to its defective germination. These results indicate that Arabidopsis KINβγ is critical for the regulation of ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is required for pollen–stigma interactions during pollination.
RNase III is a key enzyme for double-stranded RNA processing in many biological systems. In bacteria, it is best known for its role in ribosomal RNA maturation and mRNA turnover. In Bacillus subtilis, RNase III is essential for the cell's survival. We show that RNase III protects B. subtilis from the expression of toxin genes borne by two prophages, Skin and SPβ, through antisense RNA. We further explore the mechanism of RNase III–mediated decay of the txpA mRNA when paired to its antisense RNA RatA, both in vivo and in vitro.
 The filarial nematode Brugia malayi is a parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis in humans. The parasite releases extracellular vesicles ( EVs) that contain proteins and small RNA molecules that can modulate host biology. In this study, the authors profiled EV release across all life stages of B. malayi, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male and female worms. They found that EV release is conserved across the life cycle and that the protein content of the vesicles varies in a stage- and sex-specific manner. The authors also found that ivermectin, a drug used to treat lymphatic filariasis, inhibits EV release. These findings suggest that EV release may be a potential target for drug discovery efforts.
 Scabies and impetigo are common skin conditions that can be treated. However, there is a lack of epidemiological data from many countries, including the Solomon Islands. In this study, we examined 1908 people from 10 rural villages in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands and found that the total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% and the total unweighted prevalence of impetigo was 32.7%. Scabies was most common in infants and children under 4 years old, while impetigo was most common in children aged 1-4 years. Scabies and impetigo were strongly associated with each other, and community control strategies may reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications.
 Neurogenesis is the process of generating new neurons in the brain. It occurs throughout life in certain areas of the brain, including the hippocampus. The function of neurogenesis is not well understood, but it has been linked to learning, memory, and emotional regulation. We used a genetic approach to study the relationship between neurogenesis and other traits in heterogeneous stock (HS) mice. HS mice are a stock of mice descended from eight inbred progenitor strains that have been maintained for over 50 generations. We found that the rate of neurogenesis in the HS mice was highly correlated with the proportion of CD8+ versus CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets. This correlation was due to shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2Ea locus, which had a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. We also found that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof mediate the effect of T cell subsets on neurogenesis. Our results suggest that adult neurogenesis has broader impacts on the organism than previously thought.
 Chagas disease is a major health problem in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US. We have previously screened the Trypanosoma cruzi sequence database by a computational/bioinformatics approach and identified antigens that exhibited the characteristics of vaccine candidates. We investigated the protective efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine ( TcVac2 ) constituted of the selected candidates and cytokine expression plasmids in a murine model. TcVac2 induced a strong antigen-specific antibody response and a moderate level of lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge infection, TcVac2-vaccinated mice expanded the IgG2b/IgG1 antibodies and elicited a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines ( IFN-γ and TNF-α ) that resulted in control of acute parasite burden. During chronic phase, antibody response persisted, splenic activation of CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ/TNF-α cytokines subsided, and IL-4/IL-10 cytokines became dominant in vaccinated mice. The tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in heart and skeletal muscle of TcVac2-vaccinated chronic mice were undetectable by histological techniques. In comparison, mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded to T . cruzi by elicitation of a mixed ( type 1/type 2 ) antibody, T cell and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. TcVac2-induced activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T . cruzi infection, and consequently, prevented the evolution of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts.
 Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have been successful in identifying disease susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases . However, the question remains whether we can accurately predict individual disease risk based on genotype data. Previous studies have failed to achieve satisfactory performance due to the use of a limited number of confirmed susceptibility loci. In this study, we propose that sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers may improve the performance of disease risk assessment. We applied a Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) algorithm on a GWAS dataset for type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) and optimized a risk assessment model with hundreds of markers. We tested this model on two independent datasets and achieved an area under ROC curve ( AUC ) of ∼0 . 84 in both datasets. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when limited to dozens of known susceptibility loci in the SVM model or logistic regression model. Our study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers. We are optimistic that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays.
 Memory CD8+ T cells are important for providing protective immunity against viral infections. These cells can be found in the circulation and in non-lymphoid tissues such as the skin. However, the mechanisms by which memory CD8+ T cells traffic to and differentiate in non-lymphoid tissues are not well understood. In this study, the authors found that memory CD8+ T cells rapidly infiltrate the skin following Vaccinia virus infection and provide significant protective immunity. They also found that only a subset of circulating memory CD8+ T cells differentiate into functional CD69+/CD103- TRM in the skin. Finally, the authors found that after entering VacV-infected skin, circulating memory CD8+ T cells express granzyme B and require cytolytic function to provide protection against VacV infection. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms by which memory CD8+ T cells traffic to and differentiate in non-lymphoid tissues.
 Neurons have distinct axons and dendrites that are specialized for different functions. The transport of proteins to these different compartments is critical for neuronal function. Myosin motors are known to play a role in the transport of proteins to dendrites, but little is known about their role in the transport of proteins to axons. In this study, we found that Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. We also found that Myosin VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface at least in part by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis. These findings suggest that myosin motors help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins.
 We have identified two Dsx genes from Daphnia magna, a freshwater branchiopod crustacean that parthenogenetically produces males in response to environmental cues. One of these genes, designated DapmaDsx1, is responsible for the male trait development when expressed during environmental sex determination. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 was similar to that of Dsx from insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. Intriguingly, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 is different from that of insects. Rather than being regulated sex-specifically at the level of pre–mRNA splicing in the coding region, DapmaDsx1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in the abundance of its transcripts. During embryogenesis, expression of DapmaDsx1 was increased only in males and its transcripts were primarily detected in male-specific structures. Knock-down of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits including ovarian maturation, whereas ectopic expression of this gene in female embryos resulted in the development of male-like phenotypes. Expression patterns of another D . magna Dsx gene, DapmaDsx2, were similar to those of DapmaDsx1, but silencing and overexpression of this gene did not induce any clear phenotypic changes. These results establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. Our findings reveal how ESD is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using GSD. We infer that there is an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination.
 Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection that causes pain and suffering, increases the risk of HIV transmission, and can lead to neonatal herpes in newborns. A trivalent HSV-2 subunit vaccine was evaluated in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs. The vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC2, gD2, gE2) to block virus entry by gD2 and immune evasion by gC2 and gE2. In rhesus macaques, the vaccine induced plasma and mucosa neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that block gC2 and gE2 immune evasion activities, and stimulated CD4 T cell responses. After intravaginal challenge, a self-limited vaginal infection of brief duration was detected by histopathology and immunohistochemistry in naïve, but not in trivalent immunized macaques. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in female guinea pigs. Animals were mock immunized, or immunized with gD2, the trivalent vaccine, or the trivalent vaccine followed by a booster dose of gD2 (trivalent + gD2). The trivalent and trivalent + gD2 groups were 97% and 99% efficacious, respectively, in preventing genital lesions and both outperformed gD2 alone. As a marker of transmission risk, vaginal swabs were evaluated daily for HSV-2 DNA and replication competent virus between five and seven weeks after challenge. HSV-2 DNA shedding was reduced in all groups compared with mock. Shedding of replication competent virus occurred on fewer days in the trivalent than gD2 immunized animals while the trivalent + gD2 group had no shedding of replication competent virus. Overall, the trivalent group had genital lesions on <1% days and shedding of replication competent virus on 0.2% days. The vaccine has outstanding potential for prevention of genital herpes in humans.
 We have developed a new method, called Perm-seq, to analyze ChIP-seq data from highly repetitive regions of the genome. These regions are difficult to analyze because short reads from these regions can map to multiple locations in the reference genome. Our method uses additional data sources, such as DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq, to improve the accuracy of multi-read allocation. We applied our method to ENCODE ChIP-seq data from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis revealed that although the protein-DNA interaction sites in repetitive regions are evolutionarily less conserved, they share the overall sequence characteristics of protein-DNA interaction regions identified by uniquely mapping reads. Our method can be applied to other types of sequencing data and may improve the accuracy of multi-read allocation in other types of genomic analysis.
 Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that affects over 200 million people worldwide, with most cases occurring in Africa. Previous studies have suggested that people with schistosomiasis may have a higher risk of HIV-1 acquisition and impaired ability to control HIV-1 replication once infected. We conducted a nested case-control study within a large population-based survey of HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania to test these hypotheses. We found that women with schistosome infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without, while men with schistosome infections did not. We also found that individuals with active schistosome infection at the time of HIV-1 acquisition had higher HIV-1 viral loads at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. These findings suggest that pre-existing schistosome infection increases the odds of HIV-1 acquisition in women and raises HIV-1 viral load at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of schistosome infection on HIV-1 susceptibility and viral control, and to differentiate effects by gender.
45S rDNA is a highly variable and recombinogenic region in the human genome that encodes the ribosomal RNA. We used computational and experimental approaches to measure the copy number and sequence of 45S rDNA in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. We found that copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes, with loss of copies being associated with mTOR hyperactivity. We also found that rDNA copy number may be a simple and useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA damaging treatments.
 Infections with Salmonella enterica are a major public health problem worldwide . Understanding the dynamics of bacterial growth and spread within the host is crucial for developing effective treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used a combination of genetic engineering, animal models, and mathematical modeling to investigate the dynamics of Salmonella enterica infections in mice. We generated eight isogenic strains of Salmonella enterica, each with a unique genetic tag, and inoculated them into mice. We then tracked the growth and spread of each strain over time using quantitative PCR and mathematical modeling. Our results show that bacterial growth and spread are highly dynamic and heterogeneous within the host. We found that bacterial growth rates vary significantly between strains and organs, and that bacterial spread occurs through a combination of local growth and systemic transfer. Our findings provide important insights into the dynamics of Salmonella enterica infections and have implications for the development of new treatments and vaccines.
3D motion perception is a fundamental problem that the visual system has to solve. In this study, we investigate the inverse problem of 3D motion perception and the aperture problem. We show that existing processing schemes such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity do not offer a general solution to the inverse optics problem of local binocular 3D motion. Instead, we suggest that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. We predict perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion and distinguish between two plausible default strategies of 3D motion processing. Our theoretical results suggest that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are needed to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. It seems plausible that motion and disparity input is processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy.
 The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the anionic, O-acetylated exopolysaccharide alginate during chronic infection in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients to form the major constituent of a protective biofilm matrix . Four proteins have been implicated in the O-acetylation of alginate: AlgIJF and AlgX. To probe the biological function of AlgJ, we determined its structure to 1.83 Å resolution. AlgJ is a SGNH hydrolase-like protein, which while structurally similar to the N-terminal domain of AlgX exhibits a distinctly different electrostatic surface potential. Consistent with other SGNH hydrolases, we identified a conserved catalytic triad composed of D190, H192, and S288 and demonstrated that AlgJ exhibits acetylesterase activity in vitro. Residues in the AlgJ signature motifs were found to form an extensive network of interactions that are critical for O-acetylation of alginate in vivo. Using two different electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) assays, we compared the abilities of AlgJ and AlgX to bind and acetylate alginate. Binding studies using defined length polymannuronic acid revealed that AlgJ exhibits either weak or no detectable polymer binding while AlgX binds polymannuronic acid specifically in a length-dependent manner. Additionally, AlgX was capable of utilizing the surrogate acetyl-donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze the O-acetylation of polymannuronic acid. Our results, combined with previously published in vivo data, suggest that the annotated O-acetyltransferases AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation. Our refined model for alginate acetylation places AlgX as the terminal acetyltransferase and provides a rationale for the variability in the number of proteins required for polysaccharide O-acetylation.
β (1,3)-glucan is a major component of the fungal cell wall and is recognized by the host immune system through the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1. The CHO1 gene encodes a phosphatidylserine synthase that is important for β (1,3)-glucan masking. The homozygous cho1Δ/Δ mutant exhibits increased β (1,3)-glucan exposure and is hyper-sensitive to cell wall stressors. We found that the Cek1 MAPK pathway is upregulated in the cho1Δ/Δ mutant and that activation of this pathway is sufficient to cause β (1,3)-glucan exposure. These findings suggest that the Cek1 MAPK pathway plays a role in β (1,3)-glucan masking and that disruption of this pathway may contribute to the virulence of C . albicans.
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health challenge and a therapeutic imperative. A genome-wide association study was performed using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes. Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and Lewy body disease. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for neurofibrillary tangles or neuritic plaques showed positive correlation, while those for risk of vascular brain injury showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.
 Urea is a commonly used protein denaturant in biochemistry and biophysics. However, the exact role of urea in protein unfolding is still unclear. In this study, we used extensive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the kinetic role of urea in protein unfolding. We found that urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins, but with a density lower than that of the fully unfolded state. Urea also reduces the magnitude of atomic vibrations, leading to a counterintuitive slow down of the atomic-motions that opposes unfolding. Urea stickiness and slow diffusion are crucial for unfolding. Long residence urea molecules placed around the hydrophobic core are crucial to stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Our simulations indicate that although urea does not favor the formation of partially open microstates, it is not a mere spectator of unfolding. On the contrary, urea actively favors unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates, slowly driving the protein conformational ensemble far from the native one and also from the conformations sampled during thermal unfolding.
 Dengue disease is a major public health problem in Colombia, with a stable annual number of cases and major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The majority of cases were among those under 15 years of age. Gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia include studies of asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary versus secondary infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved understanding of the factors that determine disease expression and enable improvement in disease control and management is also important.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is a skin disease caused by Leishmania parasites. It is common in tropical and subtropical regions, and can be severe in people with weakened immune systems. In addition to Leishmania, people with TL may also carry other pathogens, such as HIV, bacteria, and helminths. These coinfections can affect the clinical outcome of TL and the response to treatment. This review summarizes the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. The frequency of coinfections varies depending on the region and population, but is common in many areas where TL occurs. Interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens can affect the immune response to both diseases, and may increase the risk of treatment failure and disease recurrence. More research is needed to understand how coinfections affect the natural history of TL and the response to treatment.
 The major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) is a region of the genome that plays a crucial role in the immune system. It contains many genes that are involved in the presentation of antigens to T cells. The MHC is highly variable and has been linked to many diseases. In this study, the authors used two genetic models in rats to assess the impact of natural genetic variation on MHC expression and CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment. They found that QTLs associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4∶CD8 T cell ratio colocalized within a region spanning the MHC. They also identified two intervals, each ∼0 . 25 Mb wide, in the MHC-I and II region that contributed to the phenotypic variation. The authors suggest that the variation in MHC expression and CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment may be due to polymorphisms in Tap2 and Tapbp. These findings provide new insights into the role of the MHC in the immune system and may have implications for understanding the genetic basis of disease.
 Chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is endemic in 21 Latin American countries and has recently emerged in non-endemic countries, including Spain. In this study, we analyzed hospital discharge records in Spain from 1997 to 2011 to describe the evolution of Chagas disease in the country. We found that the number of hospitalizations increased after 2005, and that the predominant patient profile was asymptomatic women at fertile age. We also identified factors associated with organ affectation, such as male gender, age between 45 and 64 years, and a median hospitalization cost above 3,065 euro. These findings highlight the need for increased efforts towards the early detection of T cruzi in Spain.
 We present BlocBuster, a novel systems-level approach for identifying combinatorial interactions of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. BlocBuster is a powerful and efficient method that employs a custom correlation coefficient to construct an allele-specific network of SNP alleles, which is subsequently partitioned into clusters of correlated alleles. Each cluster is tested for phenotypic association, and the results are rigorously validated using multiple computational trials. We apply BlocBuster to genome-wide data for psoriasis and identify a bloc of SNP alleles that is significantly associated with the disease. This bloc is replicated in independent data, thereby ensuring its accuracy and suitability for further research efforts. We compare and contrast our approach with Pearson's Correlation Coefficient ( PCC ) and observe that the PCC network had substantially weaker community structure, was more likely to introduce false-positive correlations, and required three times as much computation time.
 Agenesis of the corpus callosum ( ACC ), cerebellar hypoplasia ( CBLH ) , and polymicrogyria ( PMG ) are severe congenital brain malformations that result in significant developmental disability and seizures . While the incidence of each malformation is low, they are nevertheless the most common developmental brain malformations encountered in the clinic and both ACC and CBLH are frequently seen in prenatal brain imaging . In this study, we conducted a large-scale chromosomal copy number variation ( CNV ) discovery effort in 545 patients with one or more of these three brain malformations and in 2 , 349 control individuals . We found that ACC patients had a significantly higher prevalence of large gene-rich CNVs than CBLH and PMG patients. We also found that ACC patients had a higher prevalence of de novo CNVs than CBLH and PMG patients. Our findings suggest that large gene-rich CNVs may play a more important role in the etiology of ACC than in CBLH and PMG.
 The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is a model organism for studying regeneration and growth control. In this study, we investigated the role of the Hippo signaling pathway effector Yorkie (Yki) in planarian regeneration. We found that Yki is required for proper growth control and patterning during regeneration. In Yki-depleted animals, we observed hyper-activation of the injury response program, including increased stem cell proliferation and the expression of wound-induced genes. We also found that Yki-depleted animals have expanded epidermal and muscle cell populations. Finally, we demonstrated that Yki is required for proper scaling and size regulation of the brain, gut, and midline during morphallaxis. Our results suggest that Yki plays a critical role in integrating multiple aspects of the injury response program, including proliferation, patterning, and scaling.
 Exosomes are small vesicles that are released from cells and contain various proteins, lipids, and RNA molecules. They play important roles in intercellular communication and can be used by viruses to transfer their genetic materials to new host cells. In this study, we found that EV71 infection upregulated exosome secretion and resulted in differential packaging of the viral genomic RNA and miR-146a into exosomes. We provided evidence showing that miR-146a was preferentially enriched in exosomes while the viral RNA was not in infected cells. Moreover, the exosomal viral RNA could be transferred to and replicate in a recipient cell while the exosomal miR-146a suppressed type I interferon response in the target cell, thus facilitating the viral replication. Our findings provide evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively packaged high level miR-146a that can be functionally transferred to and facilitate exosomal EV71 RNA to replicate in the recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and is caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Two genes, PINK1 and parkin, have been identified as early-onset autosomal recessive PD genes. PINK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with a predicted mitochondrial target sequence, while parkin is a RING-finger protein with ubiquitin-ligase activity. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila have suggested that dPINK1 acts as an upstream regulator of dParkin in a common pathway that influences mitochondrial maintenance in a subset of tissues. In this study, the authors biochemically purified PINK1-binding proteins from human cultured cells and screened the genes encoding these binding proteins using Drosophila PINK1 models to isolate a molecule involved in the PINK1 pathology. They found that a mitochondrial protein, PGAM5, modulates the PINK1 pathway. Loss of Drosophila PGAM5 (dPGAM5) can suppress the muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan that result from dPINK1 inactivation and that can be attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, dPGAM5 inactivation fails to modulate the phenotypes of parkin mutant flies. Conversely, ectopic expression of dPGAM5 exacerbated the dPINK1 and Drosophila parkin (dParkin) phenotypes. These results suggest that PGAM5 negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway related to maintenance of the mitochondria and that furthermore, that PGAM5 acts between PINK1 and Parkin, or functions independently of Parkin downstream of PINK1.
 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a chronic skin disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans ( M . ulcerans ). The disease is characterized by the production of mycolactone, a cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin that induces necrosis and oedema in the skin. Despite extensive research, the role of interferon-γ ( IFNγ ) in host immune defense against M . ulcerans infection is not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that IFNγ is a critical regulator of early host immune defense against M . ulcerans infection in an experimental Buruli ulcer mouse model. IFNγ knockout mice displayed a faster progression of the infection compared to wild-type mice, with faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and oedema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. These data demonstrate a prominent role of IFNγ in early defense against M . ulcerans infection and support the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU.
 The study of the mechanism of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in mitochondria is important for understanding the pathogenesis of various diseases. The authors developed a new methodology for modeling the electron transport chain in mitochondria, which allowed them to identify two steady state modes of operation ( bistability ) of respiratory complex III at the same microenvironmental conditions. The authors also found that complex III can switch from a low ROS producing mode to a high ROS producing state during anoxia, which persists after the return to normal oxygen supply. This prediction was qualitatively validated experimentally. The authors suggest that recognition of bistability of complex III operation may enable novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress.
 We present a quantitative analysis of the role of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) in pattern formation during Drosophila embryogenesis. We use gene circuit models to investigate the regulatory effect of hkb on gap gene expression. We show that hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunchback (hb) domain, but does not have any other essential function. Specifically, hkb is required for the anterior shift in the posterior border of this domain, which is now reproduced correctly in our models. Our models are in agreement with earlier results, which they extend in two important respects: First, we show that Hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hb domain, but does not have any other essential function. Second, gap gene circuits presented here are able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, while previously published models were unable to reproduce any null mutants correctly. As a consequence, our models now capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly. This is an important step towards a better, quantitative understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network.
Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that affects humans and animals worldwide. It is caused by the bacteria Brucella abortus and is a major public health concern. Currently, there is no effective immunotherapy for Brucellosis, and treatment is often ineffective. In this study, we investigated the use of phage lysates of Brucella abortus strains S19 and RB51 as a potential immunotherapy for Brucellosis in cattle. We found that phage lysates of both strains were effective in inducing strong antibody and cell-mediated immune responses in cattle. Additionally, we developed a minimally invasive method for monitoring the efficacy of therapy using Brucella-specific RNA in plasma. Our results suggest that phage lysates of Brucella abortus strains S19 and RB51 could be a promising immunotherapy for Brucellosis in cattle.
α-Actinin-3 is a protein found in the muscles of most people around the world. It is encoded by the ACTN3 gene and is important for muscle function. In 1 . 5 billion people, a certain variation in the genetic sequence of their ACTN3 gene causes their muscles to produce no α-actinin-3 protein at all. These people have no muscle disease; however, in elite athletes, a lack of α-actinin-3 seems to be beneficial for endurance performance. Intriguingly, the ACTN3 577X null genotype is more common in European and Asian populations and less common in African populations. During recent evolution, there appears to have been strong positive selection for α-actinin-3 deficiency in places where food resources are scarce and climate is cold. We have previously demonstrated that α-actinin-3 deficiency in the Actn3 KO mouse causes a shift towards more “energy efficient” forms of muscle metabolism which would enhance survival in times of famine, and benefit endurance performance. Our present study, using single muscle fibres from Actn3 KO mice, demonstrates changes in calcium handling that would adapt muscles to cold environments and provide a survival advantage in cold climates. We uncovered a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery, and showed that transient, selective inhibition of analog-sensitive ( AS ) Cdk2 after exposure to ionizing radiation enhances cell-killing. Therefore, by chemical genetics, we uncovered both a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage and a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery.
 In this study, we used the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method to map active regulatory elements at known loci associated with hematological quantitative traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction in a megakaryocytic and an erythroblastoid cell line. We found that the two cell types exhibit distinct patterns of open chromatin and that cell-specific open chromatin can guide the finding of functional variants. We identified an open chromatin region at chromosome 7q22.3 in megakaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors the common non-coding sequence variant rs342293 known to be associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing of this open chromatin region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342293 is the only putative causative variant in this region. We demonstrated that the C- and G-alleles differentially bind the transcription factor EVI1 affecting PIK3CG gene expression in platelets and macrophages. Our data suggested a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding GWA index SNP modulates platelet phenotype.
 The study investigates the mechanism of action of two commonly used pharmacological blockers of voltage-gated ion channels, tetrodotoxin (TTX) and riluzole (RZ), on persistent sodium current (INaP) in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) of the respiratory network. The study shows that the effects of INaP block by TTX and RZ are different due to their distinct mechanisms of action. Specifically, TTX directly obstructs the Na+ pore, while RZ shifts INaP inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. The study also shows that RZ blockade of INaP can be reactivated by transient hyperpolarizing perturbations, while TTX blockade of INaP cannot be reactivated. The study predicts that RZ will fail to effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network, while complete block of INaP by experimental application of low concentration TTX within the pre-BötC will abolish the respiratory rhythm in the intact respiratory network. The study highlights the importance of considering the mechanism of action when interpreting and simulating experimental data from pharmacological blocking studies.
 In this study, we examined the role of miR-218 in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. We found that miR-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC cells and that this decrease is associated with poor prognosis in patients. We also found that miR-218 regulates the Slit-Robo1 pathway, which is involved in GC cell migration and invasion. Our results suggest that miR-218 may be a potential target for the treatment of GC metastasis.
 Atherosclerosis is a disease that causes plaque buildup in the arteries, leading to heart attacks and strokes. Statins are commonly used to treat atherosclerosis by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood. However, some patients experience severe side effects from statins. To better understand the effects of statins on atherosclerosis and to identify new targets for treatment, researchers used a mouse model with human-like hypercholesterolemia and a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins. They found that when plasma cholesterol levels were lowered, the formation of advanced plaques was prevented, and a network of cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes was identified. These genes may be useful for developing new atherosclerosis therapies.
 The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a complex structure that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity and protecting against external insults. The envelope is composed of three layers: an inner membrane, an outer membrane, and a peptidoglycan layer. The outer membrane is particularly important for the resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics. However, the mechanisms by which the envelope is assembled and maintained are not well understood. In this study, the authors developed a simple, quantitative, and high-throughput assay for mutants with envelope biogenesis defects using the reporter β-galactosidase. They screened an ordered single-gene deletion library of Escherichia coli and identified 102 genes of unknown function that likely impact envelope biogenesis. As a proof of principle, the authors characterized one of these factors, ElyC (YcbC), further and found that it plays a critical role in the metabolism of the essential lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides. The screening assay described here should be adaptable to other organisms to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures.
 The study presents a method for fusing heterogeneous datasets into an integrated view of multivariable dynamics. The method is demonstrated using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila embryos. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. The approach can be readily adapted to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further steps of data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.
 Snake venom metalloproteinases ( SVMPs ) are zinc-dependent enzymes that cause hemorrhage by degrading basement membrane ( BM ) components.  In this study, we compared the tissue localization and ECM degradation patterns of three classes of SVMPs ( PI , PII and PIII ) in vivo and in vitro.  Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that PII and PIII SVMPs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules to a higher extent than PI SVMP, which showed a more widespread distribution in the tissue.  Proteomic analysis of exudates collected in tissue injected with these enzymes revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs.  Higher extent of proteolysis was observed for the PI enzyme regarding several ECM components and fibrinogen, whereas exudates from mice injected with PII and PIII SVMPs had higher amounts of some intracellular proteins.  Our results provide novel clues for understanding the mechanisms by which SVMPs induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage.
92 kb noncoding RNA (ncRNA) called iab-8 is responsible for repressing the homeotic gene abd-A in the posterior central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila melanogaster. The iab-8 ncRNA produces a micro RNA (miR-iab-8) that represses abd-A, but also has a second, redundant repression mechanism that acts only "in cis" with the abd-A promoter. Transcriptional interference with the abd-A promoter is the most likely mechanism for this second repression. The iab-8 ncRNA is transcribed in a distal-to-proximal direction from the Abd-B transcription unit and is detected only in the developing CNS. The miR-iab-8 micro RNA is required for male and female fertility. The start site of this RNA is in the iab-8 regulatory region, downstream of Abd-B. The iab-8 ncRNA plays a crucial role in the repression of abd-A in the posterior CNS, and its function is essential for the proper development of Drosophila.
 Focal seizures are a type of epilepsy that arise from a localized area of the brain. Two common onset patterns of focal seizures are low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF) and high amplitude spikes (HAS). In this study, we used a computational model of neocortical tissue to investigate the mechanisms underlying these two patterns. We found that LAF onset is initiated by independent patches of localized activity that slowly invade the surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, HAS onset is a global transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. We also found that the difference in surrounding tissue excitability could explain the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes. Finally, we demonstrated that changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated using active stimulation. Our findings suggest that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the seizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern and surgical outcome.
 We have identified four defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins (ZmES1-4) that are specifically expressed in the female gametophyte of maize. These proteins are released during fertilization and induce pollen tube burst and explosive sperm release. We found that ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner and that K+ influx is required for this process. We also discovered that ZmES4 interacts with the intrinsic rectifying K+ channel KZM1, which opens upon ZmES4 application and closes after wash-out. Our findings suggest that ZmES4 and KZM1 are involved in a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants.
 Oncolytic viruses are being investigated as a potential treatment for cancer. One such virus is herpes simplex virus (HSV), which can be retargeted to cancer cells by modifying its tropism. In this study, we retargeted HSV to HER-2, a protein overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancer cells. We then assessed the efficacy of systemically delivered retargeted HSV against disseminated tumors in mouse models. Our results show that the retargeted HSV effectively inhibited the growth of ovarian and breast cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity. This study provides evidence for the potential use of retargeted HSV as a treatment for disseminated cancer.
 Centrosomes are essential organelles that serve as the poles of the mitotic spindle during cell division. The duplication of centrosomes once per cell cycle is tightly regulated to ensure proper chromosome segregation and prevent genomic instability. Our study has identified a new regulator of centrosome duplication, Sfi1, which is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 and dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase Cdc14. We found that reducing Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 leads to defects in spindle pole body (SPB) separation and reduplication during mitosis, as well as defects in bipolar spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Our findings suggest that phosphoregulation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 and Cdc14 has dual functions in promoting SPB separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication.
 The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr has been shown to cause G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-1-infected cells in vitro . However, its direct evidence in vivo has not been shown. In this study, we used a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model to demonstrate that Vpr causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis predominantly in proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, which mainly consist of regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs), resulting in Treg depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. The Vpr-dependent enhancement of virus replication and Treg depletion is observed in CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting that these effects are dependent on the coreceptor usage by HIV-1. When humanized mice were treated with denileukin diftitox (DD) to deplete Tregs, DD-treated humanized mice showed massive activation/proliferation of memory T cells compared to the untreated group. This activation/proliferation enhanced CCR5 expression in memory CD4+ T cells and rendered them more susceptible to CCR5-tropic wild-type HIV-1 infection than to vpr-deficient virus. Taken together, these results suggest that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells for enhancing viremia of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Because Tregs exist in a higher cycling state than other T cell subsets, Tregs appear to be more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr during acute HIV-1 infection.
 Plasmodium vivax is a major cause of malaria in Asia and the Middle East. It is prevalent in temperate areas, including South Korea, where it was successfully eliminated in the late 1970s. However, it re-emerged in 1993 and has been a persistent problem since then. To understand the genetic structure and temporal dynamics of the parasite population, we analyzed microsatellite DNA markers of 163 South Korean isolates collected from 1994 to 2008. We found that the parasite population structure changed drastically in 2002 and 2003, suggesting that the parasites were continually introduced from other population sources, possibly North Korea. Our findings highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology in understanding the transmission pattern and evaluating the effectiveness of malaria control measures.
 Introns are non-coding segments of DNA found within genes. They are thought to enhance gene expression, but the exact mechanism is not clear. In this study, the authors found that introns are important for regulating the direction of gene expression. They used a technique called strand-specific transcription run-on (TRO) analysis to measure the direction of gene expression in yeast. They found that the presence of an intron favors the expression of the mRNA over the upstream antisense transcripts (uaRNA) that initiate from the promoter. The authors also found that the intron-mediated enhancement of transcription is dependent on gene looping, which is the physical interaction of the promoter and terminator regions of a gene in a transcription-dependent manner. The authors propose that the intron-dependent gene looping places the terminator-bound factors in the vicinity of the promoter region for termination of the promoter-initiated upstream antisense transcription, thereby conferring promoter directionality. This study provides new insights into the role of introns in gene expression.
 In this study, we have identified a repressor protein that binds to a single nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of IGF2 in pigs, which leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 in skeletal muscle. The repressor protein, named ZBED6, is previously unknown, specific for placental mammals, and derived from an exapted DNA transposon. Silencing of Zbed6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affected Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing using C2C12 cells identified about 2,500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, and the deduced consensus motif gave a perfect match with the established binding site in Igf2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites showed a highly significant enrichment for certain Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. The phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts, the extreme sequence conservation, its nucleolar localization, the broad tissue distribution, and the many target genes with essential biological functions suggest that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth.
 RNA editing is a process that occurs during transcription and involves the conversion of one nucleotide to another. This process is widespread in many organisms, including humans, and can have important functional consequences. However, the mechanisms by which RNA editing is regulated and maintained are not well understood. In this study, the authors used next-generation sequencing technology to investigate the RNA editing process in rhesus macaques, a close relative of humans. They found that the majority of editing sites were A-to-G transitions and that these sites were flanked by sequences that are known to be substrates for the enzyme that catalyzes this type of editing. The authors also found that the levels of editing varied across different tissues and that these variations were associated with the expression of the enzymes that catalyze RNA editing. Overall, the findings of this study provide important insights into the mechanisms by which RNA editing is regulated and maintained in primates.
 In this study, we investigated how the brain decodes sensory information to make perceptual decisions. We found that the brain does not use an optimal decoding strategy, but instead uses a suboptimal strategy that may be due to imprecise read-out of the likelihood function. This suboptimal strategy may explain why previous studies have reported conflicting results on population decoding efficiency. Our findings suggest that the brain may not always use the most efficient decoding strategy, but instead may use a strategy that is good enough for most tasks.
21U RNAs are a class of germline-enriched small RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans that are terminally methylated, show a 5′ uridine bias, and are dependent upon and bound by the Piwi Argonaute PRG-1. These RNAs target aberrant and coding transcripts broadly via imperfect complementarity, triggering production of secondary endogenous siRNAs. A conserved motif lies upstream of 21U RNA genomic loci, which is bound by forkhead family transcription factors and is required for 21U RNA expression. We have now demonstrated that piRNAs are expressed autonomously in C. elegans. We found that each 21U RNA locus encodes all of the information necessary for driving independent, autonomous transcription from more than 15,000 unique piRNA loci in C. elegans. We also showed that more than 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are preferentially enriched in male or female germline, and that this germline enrichment is enforced by a single nucleotide position within the core motif. Our results suggest that each 21U RNA locus encodes all of the information necessary for driving independent, autonomous transcription from more than 15,000 unique piRNA loci in C. elegans.
 Brucella spp. are gram-negative bacteria that cause a zoonotic disease known as brucellosis in humans and animals. Brucella spp. replicate within host cells in the form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles. The mechanisms by which Brucella obtains a continuous membrane supply for its replication are not well understood. In this study, we found that the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, but not the PERK and ATF6 pathways, was activated in a time-dependent manner during Brucella infection. We also identified a novel host factor, Yip1A, for the activation of the IRE1 pathway in response to both tunicamycin treatment and infection with B. abortus. We found that Yip1A is responsible for the phosphorylation of IRE1 through high-order assembly of Ire1 molecules at ER exit sites (ERES) under UPR conditions. In Yip1A-knockdown cells, B. abortus failed to generate the ER-derived vacuoles and remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. These results indicate that the activation of the IRE1 pathway and the subsequent formation of ER-derived vacuole formation machineries are critical for B. abortus to establish a safe replication niche, and that Yip1A is indispensable for these processes.
 Tombusviruses are plant viruses that cause significant crop damage. In this study, we found that the tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and the carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the large viral replication compartment. The kinase function of Vps34 is critical for TBSV replication, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) phosphoinositide is utilized by TBSV for building the replication compartment. We also observed increased expression of Vps34 and the higher abundance of PI(3)P in the presence of the tombusviral replication proteins, which likely leads to more efficient tombusvirus replication. Overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibited TBSV replication on the peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on the mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, the purified PI(3)P phosphatase reduced TBSV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI(3)P with antibody or a bioprobe revealed the enrichment of PI(3)P in the replication compartment. Vps34 is directly recruited into the replication compartment through interaction with p33 replication protein. Gene deletion analysis in surrogate yeast host unraveled that TBSV replication requires the vesicle transport function of Vps34. In the absence of Vps34, TBSV cannot efficiently recruit the Rab5-positive early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment. We found that Vps34 and PI(3)P needed for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI(3)P abundance was decreased by an inhibitor of Vps34. In summary, Vps34 and PI(3)P are needed for providing the optimal microenvironment for the replication of the peroxisomal TBSV and the mitochondrial CIRV.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes dengue fever, a severe flu-like illness. Transmission of DENV from humans to mosquitoes is a critical component of dengue epidemiology. However, examinations of this process have been hampered by a lack of methods that adequately represent natural acquisition of DENV by mosquitoes from humans. In this study, we assessed artificial and natural blood feeding methods based on rates of DENV infection and dissemination within mosquitoes for use in a field-based epidemiological cohort study in Iquitos, Peru. Our study was implemented stepwise between 2011 and 2015. Participants who were 5 years and older with 5 or fewer days of fever were enrolled from ongoing clinic- and neighborhood-based studies on dengue in Iquitos. Wild type, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti were fed directly on febrile individuals or on blood collected from participants that was either untreated or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after approximately 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination. A total of 58 participants, with viremias ranging from 1.3 × 102 to 2.9 × 106 focus-forming units per mL of serum, participated in one or more feeding methods. DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-EDTA feeding; however, they were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on blood with no additive. Relative to direct mosquito feeding, infection rates showed greater variation following indirect-EDTA than indirect-no additive feeding. Dissemination rates were similar across all feeding methods. No differences were detected in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct mosquito feeding is preferable in terms of logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
 We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate sensitivity to a group of anti-neoplastic drugs that target topoisomerase II. We found that wild strains of C . elegans vary in their sensitivity to these drugs and that this natural variation is explained by a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase II. We hypothesize that this stabilizing interaction results in increased genomic instability in strains that contain a methionine residue. We also showed that this amino acid difference between the two human topoisomerase isoforms influences cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines. These results explain why hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ are differentially affected by various poisons and demonstrate the utility of C . elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses.
 The genetic mechanisms that determine lifespan and aging are poorly understood. Most research has been done on short-lived animals, and it is unclear if these insights can be transferred to long-lived mammals like humans. African mole-rats ( Bathyergidae ) have life expectancies that are multiple times higher than similar sized and phylogenetically closely related rodents. To gain new insights into genetic mechanisms determining mammalian lifespans, we obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and scanned 11 evolutionary branches associated with the evolution of enhanced longevity for positively selected genes ( PSGs ). We found that the set of 250 identified PSGs showed in liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats an expression pattern that fits the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. Moreover, we found the PSGs to be enriched for genes known to be related to aging. Among these enrichments were “cellular respiration” and “metal ion homeostasis” , as well as functional terms associated with processes regulated by the mTOR pathway: translation , autophagy and inflammation . Remarkably, among PSGs are RHEB , a regulator of mTOR , and IGF1 , both central components of aging-relevant pathways. Exemplary protein homology modeling suggests functional consequences for amino acid changes under positive selection. Therefore, we conclude that our results provide a meaningful resource for follow-up studies to mechanistically link identified genes and amino acids under positive selection to aging and lifespan determination.
A new transinfection line of Aedes albopictus ( ARwP-M ) was generated by introducing wMel Wolbachia in the ARwP line which had been established previously by replacing wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia with the wPip strain . Various infection and fitness parameters were studied by comparing ARwP-M , ARwP and wild-type ( SANG population ) Ae . albopictus sharing the same genetic background . Moreover , the vector competence of ARwP-M related to chikungunya , dengue and zika viruses was evaluated in comparison with ARwP . ARwP-M showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of wMel and wPip Wolbachia . Survival , female fecundity and egg fertility did not show to differ between the three Ae . albopictus lines . Crosses between ARwP-M males and SANG females were fully unfertile regardless of male age while egg hatch in reverse crosses increased from 0 to about 17% with SANG males aging from 3 to 17 days . When competing with SANG males for SANG females , ARwP-M males induced a level of sterility significantly higher than that expected for an equal mating competitiveness ( mean Fried index of 1 . 71 instead of 1 ) . The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was about 15 fold higher than in ARwP , mostly due to the wMel infection . This feature corresponded to a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses ( in both cases , 5 and 0% rates of transmission at 14 and 21 days post infection ) with respect to ARwP females . Results regarding Zika virus did not highlight significant differences between ARwP-M and ARwP . However , none of the tested ARwP-M females was capable at transmitting ZIKV . These findings are expected to promote the exploitation of Wolbachia to suppress the wild-type Ae . albopictus populations .
3D structures of protein-protein interactions reveal that peptide-mediated interactions have a characteristic structure that can be used to identify them. We have developed a method that uses Support Vector Machines to search for unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions among known 3D structures of protein complexes. We have also derived consensus patterns for these interactions, whenever enough information was available, and compared our results with established linear motif patterns and their binding domains. Finally, we cross-validated our newly derived patterns on interactome data and present a list of novel peptide-binding domains, along with their respective high-resolution 3D structures and consensus motifs.
 Environmental enteropathy ( EE ) is a condition that affects the small intestine and can lead to stunted growth, micronutrient malabsorption, and impaired responses to oral vaccines. We used confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) to study 49 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia. CLE images showed virtually ubiquitous small intestinal damage, with epithelial defects predominantly seen at the tips of villi. In multivariate analysis, circulating log-transformed lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was correlated with cell shedding events and with serum glucagon-like peptide-2 ( GLP-2 ). Zinc uptake from a test dose of 25mg was attenuated in 30/47 ( 64% ) individuals and in multivariate analysis was reduced by HIV , but positively correlated with GLP-2 . There was a U-shaped relationship between circulating LPS and villus surface area. Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins. Confocal endomicroscopy, claudin 4 immunostaining, and histology identify epithelial defects which are probably sites of bacterial translocation, in the presence of which increased epithelial surface area increases the burden of translocation. GLP 2 and other protective peptides may play an important role in mucosal protection in EE.
 Superinfection exclusion ( SIE ) is a phenomenon where a pre-existing virus prevents the replication of a second virus in the same cell. This phenomenon has been observed in many animal and plant viruses. In this study, the authors investigate the mechanism of SIE in turnip crinkle virus ( TCV ) infected cells. They found that the protein p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by this virus, is exclusively responsible for SIE. The authors show that p28 expressed from a TCV replicon exerts strong SIE to a different TCV replicon. They also found that p28-mediated SIE is dramatically enhanced by C-terminally fused epitope tags or fluorescent proteins, but weakened by N-terminal modifications. The authors propose a model whereby TCV SIE is caused by the formation of multimeric p28 complexes that intercept fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfector genomes, thereby abolishing superinfector replication. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of SIE and suggests a novel target for antiviral therapy.
 Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans. It is spread through contact with infected insects. A vaccine that has been shown to protect against acute infection is the trans-sialidase (TS) gene. However, long-term protection has not been reported. In this study, the authors tested whether adding a plasmid encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) to a plasmid encoding TS (pTS) would improve the duration of protection. They found that mice vaccinated with both pTS and pIL-15 had significantly better protection against lethal T. cruzi challenges 6 months after vaccination than mice vaccinated with pTS alone. This was due to an increase in the number of TS-specific IFN-γ producing total and CD8+ T cells that were better able to expand after in vitro re-stimulation. The addition of pIL-15 during genetic vaccination greatly improved long-term T cell survival, memory T cell expansion, and long-term protection against T. cruzi.
 Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. The Polo-like kinase homolog in T. brucei, TbPLK, plays essential roles in basal body segregation, flagellum attachment and cytokinesis. The level of TbPLK protein is tightly controlled, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, the authors identified a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase composed of Cullin4, the DNA damage-binding protein 1 homolog TbDDB1 and a WD40-repeat protein WDR1 that controls TbPLK abundance in the basal body and the bilobe. WDR1 interacts with the PEST motif in TbPLK and binds to TbDDB1. Depletion of WDR1 inhibits bilobe duplication and basal body segregation, disrupts the assembly of the new flagellum attachment zone filament and detaches the new flagellum. The authors conclude that WDR1 is a TbPLK receptor in the Cullin4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex for degrading TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe after the G1/S cell cycle transition, thereby promoting bilobe duplication, basal body separation and flagellum-cell body adhesion.
 DDX3X is a protein that helps the immune system fight off infections. It is important for the production of IFN-I, which is a type of cytokine that helps the immune system fight off viruses and bacteria. DDX3X is also important for the production of other cytokines that help the immune system fight off infections. It is also important for the development of immune cells. Mice that lack DDX3X are more susceptible to infections and have altered immune cell populations. This protein is important for both the innate and adaptive immune systems.
 The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism for studying the fundamental architectural design of nervous systems. In this study, we used computational network analysis to identify critical components of the C . elegans connectome that are essential for its function. We systematically removed individual neurons and synaptic connections and quantified the effects of each removal on global network properties that influence information processing. Our analysis identified 12 critical neurons and 29 critical synapses for establishing fundamental network properties. These critical components formed circuit-level pathways that provide evidence for the importance of backward locomotion, avoidance behavior, and social feeding behavior. We also identified specific evidence for parallel and serial design elements in the connectome. Our study provides a normative approach to help specify the network structure and dynamics—in which neurons are network nodes, and synapses are connections or edges between the nodes—and quantitatively identify critical components of the C . elegans connectome. These critical components are essential for the efficient information processing and integration that underlies the behavior of the organism. Our study provides a foundation for future research on the fundamental architectural design of nervous systems.
53 is a tumor suppressor protein that binds to DNA response elements ( REs ) to regulate gene expression. We used ChIP-seq to map genome-wide p53 binding in untreated and DXR-treated human lymphoblastoid cells. We found that p53 occupancy was inversely correlated with chromatin accessibility and evolutionary conservation. We also found that p53RE sequence content was highly correlated with genomic occupancy. These results suggest that p53RE sequence content and chromatin context interact to affect p53 binding and gene transactivation.
 Two-component signaling systems are a type of signaling system found in bacteria and some eukaryotes. These systems consist of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) protein. The HK senses an environmental stimulus and transfers its phosphoryl group to the RR, which then mediates the output of the signaling pathway. The one HK-two RR motif, in which one HK phosphotransfers to two separate RRs, has been identified in several microbial and plant systems. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical model of the one HK-two RR motif and performed both analytical and simulation-based analyses. These analyses revealed that this system is capable of both enhancing signal termination time and implementing a threshold signal-response relationship, meaning that the steady state levels of the phosphorylated output RR remain low until a threshold level of signal is crossed. The authors then verified these dynamics experimentally by in vitro reconstitution of the two-component proteins from the chemotaxis pathway of S . meliloti. Using this in vitro setup, the authors further showed that specific properties of the threshold dynamics can be controlled through the concentrations of the core components and the presence of an auxiliary protein that binds the HK. These findings allow a better understanding of the physiological responses mediated by phosphate sink-containing two-component systems in microbes and plants and will facilitate the design of synthetic threshold devices using two-component signaling proteins.
 We used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity in stress tolerance among individual yeast cells. We found that some cells in an isogenic population can survive extreme heat stress, and this heterogeneity is not due to genetic mutations but rather to epigenetic processes. We also discovered that some cells in a culture can survive severe heat stress without mounting a stress response, and this is due to the decoupling of the expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response. Our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.
 African trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly. It has been shown that parasites accumulate in large numbers in various organs and tissues, including the mouse testis. Whether parasites are protected from the immune system in the male reproductive organ or can be transmitted through sexual route remains unknown. In this study, we show that parasites can be detected by fine needle aspiration cytology of the male reproductive system in mice, and histopathological analysis revealed that T . brucei accumulates in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis. No parasites were found in the lumen of intact epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the testis, indicating that the large majority of the parasites are not located in immune-privileged sites. In fact, these parasites are associated with marked inflammatory cell infiltration, parasite degeneration, and severe tissue damage and rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be related with reduced fertility. Overall, we show that just like in the bloodstream and most other tissues, in the male reproductive organs, T . brucei are exposed to a strong immune response. The detection of a very high number of parasites in this organ and its accessibility opens the possibility of using fine needle aspiration cytology as a complementary diagnostic tool in Animal African Trypanosomiasis.
 Chemosensory systems are critical for survival and reproduction in many organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for chemosensory research, large families of chemosensory genes have evolved through repeated processes of gene duplication and diversification. These genes are expressed in a dynamic manner that is influenced by developmental stage, sex, reproductive state, and social context. In this study, we used customized cDNA microarrays to analyze the expression of chemosensory genes in D. melanogaster under various environmental conditions. We found that genes within clusters are independently regulated, while certain subgroups of chemosensory genes are co-regulated in response to environmental and physiological changes. We also identified a small number of exceptionally plastic genes that are differentially expressed across all environmental conditions. Our analysis of covariance of transcript levels across all environmental conditions revealed a finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory subgenome, which allows for fine-tuning of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions. Our findings provide insights into the evolution and function of chemosensory systems in D. melanogaster and may have broader implications for other organisms with large families of chemosensory genes.
 The study of human trisomies has revealed a relationship between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction at maternal meiosis I or II. Specifically, failure to recombine or recombination events located either too near to or too far from the centromere have been linked to the origin of human trisomies. In this work, we initiated studies of crossover-associated proteins (e.g., MLH1) in human fetal oocytes to analyze their number and distribution on nondisjunction-prone human chromosomes and, more generally, to characterize genome-wide levels of recombination in the human female. Our analyses indicate that the number of MLH1 foci is lower than predicted from genetic linkage analysis, but its localization pattern conforms to that expected for a crossover-associated protein. In studies of individual chromosomes, our observations provide evidence for the presence of “vulnerable” crossover configurations in the fetal oocyte, consistent with the idea that these are subsequently translated into nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte.
 Blood-feeding arthropods, such as mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks, transmit many diseases that impose serious public health and economic burdens . When a blood-feeding arthropod bites a mammal, it injects saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding . Evidence suggests that immune responses elicited by pre-exposure to arthropod saliva can alter disease progression if the host later becomes infected . Such pre-sensitisation of host immunity has been reported to both exacerbate and limit infection symptoms, depending on the system in question, with potential implications for recovery . To explore if and how immune pre-sensitisation alters the effects of vector control, we developed a general model of vector-borne disease. We found that the abundance of pre-sensitised infected hosts should increase when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality rates. If immune pre-sensitisation leads to more rapid clearance of infection, increasing vector mortality rates may achieve greater than expected disease control. However, when immune pre-sensitisation prolongs the duration of infection, e.g., through mildly symptomatic cases for which treatment is unlikely to be sought, vector control can actually increase the total number of infected hosts. The rising infections may go unnoticed unless active surveillance methods are used to detect such sub-clinical individuals, who could provide long-lasting reservoirs for transmission and suffer long-term health consequences of those sub-clinical infections. Sensitivity analysis suggests that these negative consequences could be mitigated through integrated vector management. While the effect of saliva pre-exposure on acute symptoms is well-studied for leishmaniasis, the immunological and clinical consequences are largely uncharted for other vector-parasite-host combinations. Our work shows that the interplay between vector saliva and host immunity can produce a variety of epidemiological outcomes, depending on the effect of pre-sensitisation on the duration of infection.
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The parasite Leishmania amazonensis is a common cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil. In this study, we compared the proteomes of amastigotes (the infective form of the parasite) isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice. BALB/c nude mice lack functional T cells and are a good model for studying the immune response to Leishmania infection. We found 44 differentially expressed proteins between the two strains, including proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases. Some of these proteins are known virulence factors of Leishmania, such as OPB and tryparedoxin peroxidase. We believe our study may help identify potential virulence factors and ways of regulating their expression.
 The study shows that the enzyme Activation-induced cytosine deaminase ( AID ) is regulated by the cell cycle. AID is responsible for initiating immunoglobulin gene diversification and reprogramming CpG methylation in early development. It is also involved in the development of B cell malignancies. The study shows that AID undergoes nuclear degradation more slowly in G1 phase than in S or G2-M phase, and that mutations that affect regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID stability and abundance. The study also shows that nuclear AID accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, but compromises viability in S-G2/M phase cells. The study suggests that cell cycle regulates abundance of nuclear AID and determines the ability of cells to respond to AID-initiated DNA damage. The study also suggests that cell cycle tags may be generally useful for studying DNA repair and recombination and RNA biogenesis, and for genome engineering.
 The study of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass is important to understand carbon flow in the environment, promote healthy human nutrition, and develop industrial processes based on cellulosic bioconversion. Here, we demonstrate a broadly applicable method to analyze how microbes catabolize plant polysaccharides that integrates carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening. We apply this method to study how the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans ferments plant biomass components including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. These polysaccharides are fermented with variable efficiencies, and diauxies prioritize metabolism of preferred substrates. Strand-specific RNA-seq reveals how this bacterium responds to polysaccharides by up-regulating specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. Fifty-six up-regulated CAZymes were purified, and their activities show most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with divergent rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. CAZymes were then tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. We discuss how these results advance our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass.
1974–2005 studies across Sierra Leone showed onchocerciasis endemicity in 12 of 14 health districts ( HDs ) and baseline studies 2005–2008 showed lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) endemicity in all 14 HDs . Three integrated annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) were conducted in the 12 co-endemic districts 2008–2010 with good geographic , programme and drug coverage . Midterm assessment was conducted 2011 to determine impact of these MDAs on LF in these districts . The mf prevalence and intensity in the 12 districts were determined using the thick blood film method and results compared with baseline data from 2007–2008 . Overall mf prevalence fell from 2 . 6% ( 95% CI: 2 . 3%–3 . 0% ) to 0 . 3% ( 95% CI: 0 . 19%–0 . 47% ) , a decrease of 88 . 5% ( p = 0 . 000 ) ; prevalence was 0 . 0% ( 100 . 0% decrease ) in four districts: Bo , Moyamba , Kenema and Kono ( p = 0 . 001 , 0 . 025 , 0 . 085 and 0 . 000 respectively ) ; and seven districts had reductions in mf prevalence of between 70 . 0% and 95 . 0% ( p = 0 . 000 , 0 . 060 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 014 , 0 . 000 , 0 . 000 and 0 . 002 for Bombali , Bonthe , Kailahun , Kambia , Koinadugu , Port Loko and Tonkolili districts respectively ) . Pujehun had baseline mf prevalence of 0 . 0% , which was maintained . Only Bombali still had an mf prevalence ≥1 . 0% ( 1 . 58% , 95% CI: 0 . 80%–3 . 09% ) ) , and this is the district that had the highest baseline mf prevalence: 6 . 9% ( 95% CI: 5 . 3%–8 . 8% ) . Overall arithmetic mean mf density after three MDAs was 17 . 59 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 15 . 64 mf/ml–19 . 55 mf/ml ) among mf positive individuals ( 65 . 4% decrease from baseline of 50 . 9 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 40 . 25 mf/ml–61 . 62 mf/ml; p = 0 . 001 ) and 0 . 05 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 0 . 03 mf/ml–0 . 08 mf/ml ) for the entire population examined ( 96 . 2% decrease from baseline of 1 . 32 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 1 . 00 mf/ml–1 . 65 mf/ml; p = 0 . 000 ) ) . The results show that mf prevalence decreased to <1 . 0% in all but one of the 12 districts after three MDAs . Overall mf density reduced by 65 . 0% among mf-positive individuals , and 96 . 2% for the entire population examined . , Introduction:  Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) and onchocerciasis are two of the major neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) presently targeted for elimination using the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommended strategy of preventive chemotherapy and transmission control ( PCT ) [1] , [2] , [3] . LF is a disease caused by the lymphatic filarial roundworms Wuchereria bancrofti , Brugia malayi and Brugia timori , and transmitted by mosquitos . It is highly endemic in the tropics and subtropics ( Africa , Asia , South Pacific and
16S rRNA gene sequencing is a powerful tool for studying microbial communities, but the analysis of such data can be challenging due to the compositional nature of the data. Compositional data are relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their absolute abundances. This can lead to unreliable results when using standard analysis techniques. We show that the severity of these compositional effects is modulated by community diversity. We developed a new approach, called SparCC, which is capable of estimating correlations from compositional data. Using SparCC, we inferred a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. We estimated that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data. As predicted, most of the erroneous links are found in the samples with the lowest diversity.
 Lysozyme is a host defense protein found in high concentrations in mucosal surfaces that can kill bacteria by hydrolyzing their peptidoglycan.  Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a common colonizer of the upper respiratory tract and causes pneumonia and meningitis.  Two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, have been shown to modify peptidoglycan and increase resistance to lysozyme in vitro.  In this study, the authors used competition experiments to examine the role of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications in pneumococcal colonization of the upper respiratory tract.  They found that the wild-type strain outcompeted a mutant strain lacking both PgdA and Adr in mice with normal levels of lysozyme, but not in mice lacking lysozyme.  This suggests that lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications are important for pneumococcal colonization.  The authors also found that individual mutations in either PgdA or Adr were sufficient to increase sensitivity to lysozyme in vitro, but did not affect colonization in vivo.  This suggests that the combination of peptidoglycan modifications reduces overall fitness, but that this is outweighed by the benefits of resistance to the peptidoglycan degrading activity of lysozyme.  Overall, this study provides important insights into the role of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications in pneumococcal colonization and host defense.
 Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes a wide range of clinical symptoms, from mild fever to severe hemorrhagic fever and shock. It is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries, including Brazil. The goal of this study was to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool to detect DENV in tissue specimens from previously confirmed dengue fatal cases. The study included 23 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 874 fatal cases that occurred in 2002 in Brazil. The overall dengue fatal case diagnosis based on the tissues analyzed by Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the NS1 Ag Strip was 34.7%, 60.8%, and 91.3%, respectively. The NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus when compared to the other two ELISA assays. This study shows the DENV NS1 capture assay as a rapid and valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation. With an increasing number of DHF and fatal cases, the availability of new approaches useful for cases confirmation plays an important tool for the disease surveillance.
 Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a blood cancer that affects plasma cells. The study aimed to understand the differences in molecular alterations in MM as a function of self-reported race and genetic ancestry. The study used somatic whole exome, RNA-sequencing, and correlated clinical data from 718 MM patients from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study Interim Analysis 9. The study found that BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2 have significantly higher mutation frequencies among African American (AA) cases. These genes are all involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. The study also found that TP53 and IRF4 have significantly higher mutation frequencies among Caucasian (CA) cases. The study provides rationale for interrogating diverse tumor cohorts to best understand tumor genomics across populations.
 The vast majority of mutations in cancer cells are neutral ( passengers ) and do not affect the reproductive rate of the cell . These passengers can provide important information about the evolutionary history of an individual cancer and serve as a molecular clock . Passengers can also become targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment . We study the stochastic expansion of a population of cancer cells describing the growth of primary tumors or metastatic lesions . We first analyze the process by looking forward in time and calculate the fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive passenger mutations ordered by their time of appearance . We compute the likelihood of specific evolutionary trees , thereby informing the phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer evolution in individual patients . Next , we derive results looking backward in time: for a given subclonal mutation we estimate the number of cancer cells that were present at the time when that mutation arose . We derive exact formulas for the expected numbers of subclonal mutations of any frequency . Fitting this formula to cancer sequencing data leads to an estimate for the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells during the early stages of clonal expansion .
 Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the huntingtin protein. The polyQ region is prone to misfolding and aggregation, leading to the formation of toxic inclusions in neurons. To understand the misfolding and aggregation of the polyQ region, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric XN1, the first exon of the huntingtin protein, with and without the flanking regions. We found that the flanking regions play a significant role in the misfolding and aggregation of the polyQ region. The polyproline regions in particular, compete with the polyQ region to form PPII helices, which may protect against aggregation. The Nt17 region, which is N-terminal to the polyQ region, can also affect the aggregation of the polyQ region. Our study provides insights into the misfolding and aggregation of the polyQ region in XN1 and highlights the importance of considering the flanking regions in understanding the pathogenesis of HD.
 CRISPRs ( Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ) are a type of immune defense system found in bacteria and archaea that protects against foreign nucleic acids such as viruses and plasmids. CRISPRs consist of repeats and spacers, which are acquired from foreign DNA and used to target and destroy invading nucleic acids. CRISPRs are highly diverse and abundant in the genomes of bacteria and archaea, and can change rapidly in response to viral predation. The Human Microbiome Project ( HMP ) provides a wealth of shotgun metagenomic data that can be used to study the distribution and diversity of CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities. We developed a targeted assembly strategy to identify CRISPRs in these data, and found that CRISPRs are largely body-site specific and can be used to trace rare species and the virus exposure of individuals. Our work highlights the importance of CRISPRs in understanding the dynamic ecology of microbiomes.
 The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established model organism for the study of development and behavior. However, the presence of a bona fide circadian clock in this organism remains unclear. Here, we used genome-wide expression profiling to identify light- and temperature-entrained oscillating transcripts in C . elegans. These transcripts exhibited rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-h periods and were sustained under constant conditions, suggesting that they are under circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles strongly drove gene expression and appeared to entrain largely nonoverlapping gene sets. We found that mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolished both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, implying that environmental cues act cell nonautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. Together, these findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C . elegans and suggest that further analyses in this organism will provide new information about the evolution and function of this biological clock.
 The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene is the homolog of human XPD, an essential gene encoding a DNA helicase of the TFIIH complex involved in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Some mutant alleles of RAD3 (rad3-101 and rad3-102) have partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies showed that the hyper-Rec phenotype associated with rad3-101 and rad3-102 can be explained as a consequence of persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. In this study, we further characterized these events using a system in which the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination are recovered. Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events shows that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs). The remainder reflects DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. We mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. We found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. In addition, there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. A comparison of these data with our previous analysis of spontaneous mitotic recombination events suggests that a sub-set of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
 The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori has a large set of simple sequence repeats ( SSRs ) that constitute contingency loci. Through a slipped strand mispairing mechanism, the SSRs generate heterogeneous populations that facilitate adaptation. In this study, we present a model that explains, in molecular terms, how an intergenically located T-tract, via slipped strand mispairing, operates with a rheostat-like function to fine-tune activity of the promoter that drives expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin SabA. Using T-tract variants in an isogenic strain background, we show that the length of the T-tract generates multiphasic output from the sabA promoter. Consequently, this alters the H . pylori binding to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on gastric mucosa. Fragment length analysis of post-infection isolated clones shows that the T-tract length is a highly variable feature in H . pylori. This mirrors the host-pathogen interplay, where the bacterium generates a set of clones from which the best-fit phenotypes are selected in the host. In silico and functional in vitro analyses revealed that the length of the T-tract affects the local DNA structure and thereby binding of the RNA polymerase, through shifting of the axial alignment between the core promoter and UP-like elements. We identified additional genes in H . pylori with T- or A-tracts positioned similar to that of sabA and show that variations in the tract length likewise acted as rheostats to modulate cognate promoter output. Thus, we propose that this generally applicable mechanism mediated by promoter-proximal SSRs provides an alternative mechanism for transcriptional regulation in bacteria, such as H . pylori, which possesses a limited repertoire of classical trans-acting regulatory factors.
HPVs are a group of viruses that cause cervical cancer and other genital cancers. To establish persistent infection, HPVs must evade the host immune system. One way they do this is by downregulating the expression of a protein called STAT-1. In this study, the authors found that HPVs also downregulate the expression of another protein called STAT-5. They also found that STAT-5 is important for HPV genome amplification, which is necessary for the production of new viral particles. The authors suggest that STAT-5 may be a potential target for new treatments against HPV infections.
 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S . Typhi) is a human-specific pathogen that causes enteric fever (typhoid fever) globally. It can persist in the biliary tract of infected individuals, resulting in a state of asymptomatic chronic carriage. Chronic carriers may act as persistent reservoirs of infection within a community and may introduce infection to susceptible individuals and new communities. Little is known about the interaction between the host and pathogen in the biliary tract of chronic carriers, and there is currently no reliable diagnostic assay to identify asymptomatic S . Typhi carriage. To study host-pathogen interactions in the biliary tract during S . Typhi carriage, we applied an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) to identify potential biomarkers unique to carriers. Thirteen S . Typhi antigens that were immunoreactive in carriers but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area were identified. The identified antigens included a number of putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. YncE (STY1479), an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in our screen. The response to YncE in patients whose biliary tract contained S . Typhi was compared to responses in patients whose biliary tract did not contain S . Typhi, patients with acute typhoid fever, and healthy controls residing in a typhoid endemic area. Seven of 10 (70%) chronic carriers, 0 of 8 bile culture-negative controls (0%), 0 of 8 healthy Bangladeshis (0%), and 1 of 8 (12.5%) Bangladeshis with acute typhoid fever had detectable anti-YncE IgG in blood. IgA responses were also present. Further evaluation of YncE and other antigens identified by IVIAT could lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays to identify asymptomatic S . Typhi carriers.
 In this study, we investigated the role of cellular RNA pools produced by homologous genomic loci in defining the transcriptional state of a silenced gene. We found that non-functional alleles of the white gene, unable to produce a coding transcript, could reactivate in trans the expression of a wild type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. This new epigenetic phenomenon of transcriptional trans-reactivation is heritable, relies on the presence of homologous RNA's, and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. Our data suggest a general new unexpected level of gene expression control mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes.
 Ticks are blood-sucking insects that use protease inhibitors to prevent the host's immune system from attacking them. These inhibitors are found in the salivary glands and midgut of ticks. Boophilin is a protease inhibitor found in the midgut of the tick Rhipicephalus microplus. It inhibits thrombin, elastase, kallikrein, and FXIa. Boophilin also blocks platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in vitro. It also inhibits carotid artery occlusion in vivo triggered by FeCl3 and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method. Boophilin plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment at low hemostatic and inflammatory tonus, which allows ticks to successfully digest a blood meal.
 The gut epithelium is a complex system that plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis and protecting against pathogens. The Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue ( SEGMEnT ) is a computational model that simulates the behavior of gut epithelial cells and their interactions with each other and their environment. SEGMEnT incorporates both healthy and diseased states of the gut, and can be used to explore the effects of different perturbations and treatments on gut function. SEGMEnT has been used to investigate the effects of inflammation on gut morphogenesis, and has been shown to accurately reproduce the effects of different signaling pathway inhibitions on gut architecture. SEGMEnT is a valuable tool for understanding the complex interactions that occur in the gut, and can be used to develop new treatments for a range of gastrointestinal diseases.
 The study aimed to determine the role of insulin action in myeloid cells in obesity-associated insulin resistance. The authors conditionally inactivated the insulin receptor in myeloid lineage cells in mice ( IRΔmyel-mice ) and found that these animals exhibit unaltered glucose metabolism on a normal diet but are protected from the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance upon high fat feeding. Euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp studies demonstrated that this results from decreased basal hepatic glucose production and from increased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, IRΔmyel-mice exhibit decreased concentrations of circulating tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) α and thus reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) activity in skeletal muscle upon high fat feeding, reflecting a dramatic reduction of the chronic and systemic low-grade inflammatory state associated with obesity. This is paralleled by a reduced accumulation of macrophages in white adipose tissue due to a pronounced impairment of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) 9 expression and activity in these cells. These data indicate that insulin action in myeloid cells plays an unexpected, critical role in the regulation of macrophage invasion into white adipose tissue and in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance.
Poxviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in humans and animals. They have a complex signaling system that helps them to replicate and spread. In this study, researchers used a technique called experimental evolution to search for new ways that the poxvirus signaling system works. They found that a protein called B12 helps to regulate the signaling system. This protein is not normally active in the poxvirus, but when it is turned on, it helps to control the spread of the virus. The researchers also found that B12 is important for the poxvirus to replicate and spread in cells. This protein is not normally found in other viruses, so it may be a unique feature of poxviruses. Overall, this study provides new insights into how poxviruses work and how they can be controlled.
α-helical peptides are important for many biological processes, including protein folding, membrane penetration, and cell-to-cell communication. However, the folding and aggregation of these peptides are highly sensitive to environmental factors, such as pH, ion strength, and the presence of interfaces. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the folding and aggregation behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, which have built-in secondary amphiphilicity upon forming an α-helix. We found that the peptides are neither random coils in bulk water nor fully formed α-helices, but adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. These provide a basis for conformation-selection and population-shift upon environmental changes. We also found that the peptides’ aggregation behavior is strongly affected by the presence or absence of an interface, and their response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces can be linked to their inherent α-helical tendencies in bulk water. Our study provides insight into the folding and aggregation of α-helical peptides at interfaces and may help to understand the role of these peptides in biological processes.
iciHHV-6 is a rare genetic condition in which the HHV-6 virus integrates into the telomeres of host chromosomes, resulting in inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 ( iciHHV-6 ). The molecular mechanism of this integration remains unknown. In this study, the authors generated recombinant viruses with deleted or modified telomeric repeats ( TMR ) and analyzed their replication and integration properties. They found that the TMR are not essential for HHV-6A replication but are crucial for integration and genome maintenance in latently infected cells. The pTMR play the major role in integration, while the impTMR only make a minor contribution. The authors propose a model for HHV-6A integration based on their findings.
Poxviruses are a family of viruses that produce infectious particles that do not acquire their internal lipid membrane by budding through cellular compartments. Instead, poxvirus immature particles are generated from atypical crescent-shaped precursors whose architecture and composition remain contentious. Here, we describe the 2.6 Å crystal structure of vaccinia virus D13, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. D13 folds into two jellyrolls decorated by a head domain of novel fold. It assembles into trimers that are homologous to the double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. We show that, when tethered onto artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice and assembly products structurally similar to the viral crescents and immature particles. The architecture of the D13 honeycomb lattice and the lipid-remodeling abilities of D13 support a model of assembly that exhibits similarities with the giant mimivirus. Overall, these findings establish that the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. Furthermore, D13 is the target of rifampicin and its structure will aid the development of poxvirus assembly inhibitors.
 The root system plays a crucial role in plant growth and survival. The root system architecture is determined by developmental and environmental factors. The root system can only respond to variation in such resources within its inherent developmental limits of growth rate and branching capacity. Optimization of root system architecture through breeding is therefore of particular interest in crops. Our knowledge about the molecular genetic control of root growth and branching has been largely obtained from analyses of the dicotyledon plant model system Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ) through mutagenesis approaches. Many of the genes identified through these efforts encode proteins with regulatory functions, and among them components of plant hormone signaling pathways are particularly preeminent. For example, interference with the auxin-signaling pathway typically impairs primary root elongation or root branching, and in extreme cases even abolishes root formation. The same is true for loss-of-function mutations in genes that encode enzymes involved in tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis. In particular, auxin biosynthesis from tryptophan via indole-3-pyruvic acid ( IPA ) has been shown to be essential for root formation. Two enzyme classes define this pathway: the TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 ( TAA1 ) and TAA1-RELATED ( TAR ) proteins, which catalyze the conversion of tryptophan to IPA; and the family of YUCCA cytochrome P450s, which catalyze the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid ( IAA ), the major active form of auxin. Whereas the YUCCA genes were originally identified through a gain-of-function approach that led to auxin over-accumulation, TAA1/TAR genes were identified through loss-of-function approaches. For instance, one study isolated the taa1 mutant because of its root growth resistance to the application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid ( ACC ), a rate-limiting precursor for the biosynthesis of another hormone, ethylene. This phenotype arises as a consequence of reduced auxin biosynthesis, which is normally up-regulated by ethylene through induction of TAA1/TAR gene expression. This finding also illustrates the dosage-dependent action of auxin, because although auxin and its perception are essential for root formation and growth, excess auxin application, biosynthesis, or signaling are eventually inhibitory. Indeed, it has been suggested that depending on the species, auxin levels might be supra-optimal for root growth. Phylogenetic analysis has identified bona fide TAA1/TAR homologous genes in monocotyledons, with varying degrees of redundancy. For instance, whereas maize contains five genes of this family, only two are found in both rice and the monocotyledon model system, Brachypodium distachyon ( Brachypodium ). So far, only one TAA1/TAR-related mutant has been identified in monocotyledons, the vanishing tassel 2 ( vt2 ) mutant of maize. Despite the presence of multiple TAA1/TAR homologs in maize, vt2 null mutants display rather severe shoot phenotypes, such as dwarfism, reduced axillary meristem formation, and associated impaired inflorescence development. Free auxin levels are reduced to ca. one third of wild type levels in vt2 mutants, suggesting that VT2 encodes the predominant TAA1/TAR activity in maize. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a Brachypodium mutant in the TAR2-LIKE ( BdTAR2L ) gene. Unlike vt2, this Bdtar2l mutant displays only mild shoot phenotypes. However, we observed dramatic root phenotypes, which surprisingly appear to result from upwardly disturbed auxin homeostasis.
The evolution of gene expression is a fundamental process in biology. In yeast, the rate at which genes diverge in expression is influenced by the organization of their promoter nucleosomes. We artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins and found that promoter organization did not affect the ability to increase expression. However, the two classes of genes adapted by distinct mechanisms: DPN genes increased expression through duplication of large genomic regions, while OPN genes favored trans mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN genes reverted rapidly to wild-type expression levels, while OPN genes did not. Our results suggest that promoter organization impacts on the early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution.
 The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is a retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) in 2-5% of infected individuals over a course of several decades . HTLV-1 transactivator/oncoprotein Tax is thought to play a key role in ATL development. Tax is a potent activator of HTLV-1 transcription and NF-κB. Tax activates the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome ( APC/C ) and leads to premature poly-ubiquitination and degradation of mitotic regulators including cyclin B and Skp2. The premature degradation of Skp2 leads to SCFSkp2 inactivation and p27 protein stabilization. The massive surge in p21 and p27 leads to p53- and pRb-independent cellular senescence termed Tax-induced rapid senescence ( Tax-IRS ). Here, we show that the p21-/27-mediated cellular senescence induced by Tax constitutes a cellular checkpoint response towards chronic NF-κB hyper-activation. We further demonstrate that RelA is the primary effector of this pathway and RelA acts upstream of the APC/C and RelB to stabilize p27 protein and p21 mRNA respectively. Our results suggest that impairment to the p21-/27-mediated senescence checkpoint facilitates constitutive NF-κB activation and leukemia development. Importantly, we found that the HTLV-1 anti-sense RNA-encoded bZip protein, HBZ, could mitigate Tax-induced senescence by virtue of its ability to inhibit NF-κB. HBZ has been shown previously to block trans-activation of viral mRNA expression by Tax. Thus, active HTLV-1 replication characterized by potent Tax-mediated LTR and NF-κB activation leads to senescence, while moderation of Tax activities and attenuation of viral replication by HBZ allow HTLV-1-infected T cells to proliferate, expand, and persist.
 The frontal lobe is responsible for decision-making and executive control, but current models do not explain how humans make decisions in uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations.  We propose a new computational model of human executive function that clarifies this issue.  Using behavioral experiments, we show that our model predicts human decisions and their variations across individuals in naturalistic situations.  The model reveals that the frontal function monitors up to three/four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers online their ability to predict action outcomes.  This limitation is compensated by the binary structure of executive control that in ambiguous and unknown situations promotes the exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies.  The results support a model of human frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior.
 The liver plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism in the body. The liver X receptor ( LXR ) is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and is a potential drug target for treating atherosclerosis. However, pharmacological activation of LXR can induce unwanted side effects such as increased hepatic triglyceride levels and enlarged very-low-density-lipoprotein ( VLDL ) particles. In this study, we used a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories ( ADAPT ) to investigate the long-term effects of pharmacological activation of LXR on lipid metabolism in the liver. We found that the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol was reduced upon prolonged treatment, which was predicted by the ADAPT model. We also found that the scavenger receptor class B1 ( SR-B1 ), a receptor that facilitates the uptake of cholesterol from high-density-lipoproteins ( HDL ) by the liver, was downregulated rather than upregulated upon treatment. These findings provide important insights into the long-term effects of pharmacological activation of LXR and may help in the design of new drug targets to treat atherosclerosis.
 The cerebellum is a vital structure for coordination of our multi-segmented bodies and limbs. The spinocerebellar and spino-reticulo-cerebellar systems are major sources of mossy fiber ( MF ) inputs for the cerebellum. These systems receive sensory feedback and motor command signals, which are combined in the neurons of origin. The granule cells ( GrCs ) that receive this input are thresholded with respect to their spike output. The spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations, which can be described as linear projections through aspects of the multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. The cerebellar cortex enhances the utility of these projections by allowing the Purkinje cell to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. Our hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, illustrating how the coordinating functions of the cerebellum can be crucially supported by the recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems.
 We have identified microRNAs in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and profiled their expression during CHIKV infection. We found that CHIKV infection specifically altered the miRNA profile of a specific set of eight miRNAs. These miRNAs may be playing a role in cellular modification during CHIKV infection. Our study provides an insight about cellular modification by miRNAs during CHIKV infection and the results provide leads for identifying potential candidates for vector based antiviral strategies.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic infection that affects humans and livestock. It is a significant medical and economic problem in many developing countries, including Iran. The purpose of this study was to determine the monetary burden of CE in Iran. The study estimated the number of surgical cases per year for 2000–2009 at 1,295. The number of asymptomatic individuals living in the country was estimated at 635,232 (95% CI 149,466–1,120,998). The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at US$232.3 million (95% CI US$103.1–397.8 million), including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at US$93.39 million (95% CI US$6.1–222.7 million) and the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at US$132 million (95% CI US$61.8–246.5 million). The cost per surgical human case was estimated at US$1,539. CE has a considerable economic impact on Iran, with the cost of the disease approximated at 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. Establishment of a CE surveillance system and implementation of a control program are necessary to reduce the economic burden of CE on the country. Cost-benefit analysis of different control programs is recommended, incorporating present knowledge of the economic losses due to CE in Iran.
 Polyomavirus ( MPyV ) is a small circular DNA virus that infects mouse cells and transforms rat cells in culture. We have used deep sequencing to follow MPyV infection of mouse NIH3T6 cells at various times after infection and analyzed both the viral and cellular transcriptomes. Alignment of sequencing reads to the viral genome illustrated the transcriptional profile of the early-to-late switch with both early-strand and late-strand RNAs being transcribed at all time points. A number of novel insights into viral gene expression emerged from these studies, including the demonstration of widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts at late times in infection. By late times in infection, 359 host genes were seen to be significantly upregulated and 857 were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis indicated transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated while transcripts involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc finger binding, SH3 domain, and GTPase activation were downregulated. The levels of a number of long noncoding RNAs were also altered. We discuss these results in light of what is currently known about the MPyV life cycle and its effects on host cell growth and metabolism.
 The present study uses a mathematical model to estimate the distance at which a marathon runner will exhaust his or her glycogen stores as a function of running intensity. The model takes into account the runner's aerobic capacity, the size of the glycogen reservoir, and the metabolic cost of running. The study reveals the functional dependencies of the distance required to run glycogen stores to depletion, as well as the fastest pace at which a given distance can be run without exhausting glycogen stores. The study also provides a quantitative approach to establishing an effective midrace fueling strategy, designed to extend the distance a given runner can cover or to increase the maximum pace at which a runner can cover a given distance before exhausting his or her glycogen stores. The study shows how individual physiologic variation as well as the population distribution of aerobic capacities limit marathon finishing times, providing a principled basis for marathon qualifying standards such as those used in the Boston Marathon.
 Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that infects many animals, including humans. Most isolates of Toxoplasma from Europe and North America fall into one of three genetically distinct clonal lineages, type I, II, and III. However, in South America, these strains are rarely isolated and instead a great variety of other strains are found. Toxoplasma strains differ widely in a number of phenotypes in mice, such as virulence, persistence, oral infectivity, migratory capacity, induction of cytokine expression, and modulation of host gene expression. The outcome of toxoplasmosis in patients is also variable and we hypothesize that, besides host and environmental factors, the genotype of the parasite strain plays a major role. To determine if non-canonical Toxoplasma strains have unique interactions with the host cell, we infected murine macrophages with 29 different Toxoplasma strains, representing global diversity, and used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. We identified large differences between strains in the expression level of known parasite effectors and large chromosomal structural variation in some strains. We also identified novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains. IFNβ production by infected cells was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macrophages and the cytoplasmic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) in fibroblasts. These data provide insight into the host response to a large variety of Toxoplasma strains and, together with the SNPs dataset we recently published for these strains [18], can form the basis for the discovery of novel Toxoplasma effectors.
 Recombination is a key mechanism of genetic diversity in enteroviruses, which cause a wide range of diseases in humans. We have developed a novel reverse genetic system to study recombination in enteroviruses. Our studies suggest that replicative recombination is a biphasic process in which an initial chimeric genome is generated that contains a duplication of up to several hundred nucleotides ( nt . ) of the virus genome. Subsequent replication of these genomes results in a process of resolution in which variants are selected that have undergone an internal deletion to remove the duplicated sequences, resulting in genomes of the expected ( i . e . genomic ) length. These studies provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of recombination in positive strand RNA viruses and suggest a means by which ‘evolution by duplication’ may occur.
 In this study, the authors explore the role of organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) in the clearance of norepinephrine (NE) in white adipose tissue (WAT). They show that Oct3 is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes. The authors further demonstrate that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes and that Oct3 governs β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes. Under NE administration, adipocyte-specific Oct3 knockout (KO) mice show much stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than control mice. The authors suggest that Oct3 plays an essential role in the browning of WAT during adaptive thermogenesis and that inhibition of Oct3 may provide distinct therapeutic applications by activating energy expenditure pathways.
 HP1 proteins are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated silencing and chromosome structure in diverse eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, the HP1 family is composed of HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ. HP1 proteins are detected not only in dense heterochromatic regions but also on active euchromatic genes. HP1 proteins seem to be present both during phases of silencing and transcriptional activity. HP1 proteins contain two very similar domains known as the chromo-domain (CD) and the chromoshadow-domain (CSD) separated by a less structured hinge region. The CSD is required for dimerization and interaction with many molecular partners that share a PXVXL motif. The CD recognizes and binds histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9 (K9), an epigenetic mark frequently associated with transcriptional repression. In contrast to the strong binding to peptides mimicking histone H3 tails methylated on K9, HP1 proteins bind only weakly to reconstituted methylated nucleosomal arrays. HP1 proteins bind more efficiently to native chromatin in vitro when DNA replication disrupts the histone octamers. HP1α interacts with Brg1 and Brm, the mutually exclusive catalytic subunit of the human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complex. HP1 proteins have a negative effect on hSWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling. hSWI/SNF activity is involved in the recruitment of HP1 proteins to chromatin.
 RNA molecules fold into specific shapes that are critical for their function. The shape of a particular RNA substring may depend on its surrounding sequence. However, some RNAs such as microRNAs retain their specific structures during biogenesis, which involves extraction of the substructure from a larger structural context. We defined the property of self containment to be the tendency for an RNA sequence to robustly adopt the same optimal secondary structure regardless of whether it exists in isolation or is a substring of a longer sequence of arbitrary nucleotide content. We measured degree of self containment using a scoring method we call the self-containment index and found that miRNA stem loops exhibit high self containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway. We also found that miRNAs display significantly enhanced self containment compared to other functional RNAs, but we also found a trend toward natural selection for self containment in most functional RNA classes. We suggest that self containment arises out of selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of structural function. Analysis of self containment will be important for both annotation and design of functional RNAs.
 In this study, we identified four transcription factors that are important for disease resistance against necrotrophic fungal pathogens. We found that mutants defective in any of these TFs displayed increased disease susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the mutants shared a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes. We characterized several of the up-regulated genes that encode peptides with a secretion signal, which we named PROVIR (for provirulence) factors. Forward and reverse genetic analyses revealed that many of the PROVIRs are important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs. The TFs and PROVIRs identified in our work thus represent novel genetic determinants for plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens.
 The uterine endometrium is receptive to the implanting embryo only during a discrete period in the female reproductive cycle, known as the “window of receptivity” ( WOR ) . The WOR is regulated at the level of gene expression by the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone acting via their cognate nuclear receptors, the estrogen receptor ( ESR1 ) and the progesterone receptor ( PGR ) . One of the transcription factors which co-regulates PGR action is the Forkhead Box O1 ( FOXO1 ) . FOXO1 is localized in the nucleus of the luminal ( LE ) and glandular ( GE ) epithelium of the endometrium during the WOR in humans and mice and in the cytoplasm of the murine decidua as pregnancy processes . The conditional ablation of Foxo1 using the PgrCre resulted in infertility due to disrupted implantation of the blastocyst . Surprisingly , the post implantation decidual process was not severely impacted . Analysis of the FOXO1-dependent transcriptome at day 4 . 5 of pseudopregnancy ( PPD 4 . 5 ) identified several important pathways involved in the fetal-maternal crosstalk regulated by FOXO1 . One of the processes altered was the expression of PGR in the uterine epithelium during the WOR . We then demonstrated that expression of FOXO1 and loss of PGR are interrelated and a can serve as a marker for the WOR in mice and humans .
Dengue is a tropical disease caused by the dengue virus and transmitted by female mosquitoes. It is a major public health problem in many countries, including Bangladesh. To better understand the spatial variation in dengue incidence in Bangladesh, we developed a negative binomial generalized linear mixed effects model that accounts for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects. We found that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with mean monthly diurnal temperature range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Mean monthly rainfall at two months lag was positively associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and districts bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated that 92% of the annual dengue cases occurred between August and September. Cases were identified across the country with 94% in the capital Dhaka. Less than half of the affected districts reported cases as observed from the surveillance data. The proportion reported varied by month with a higher proportion reported in high-incidence districts, but dropped towards the end of high transmission season. Our findings can help target control interventions to areas of highest need at the appropriate time.
 We have found that mice establish a preferred place in a large empty arena, which they mark by performing a tortuous path full of twists and turns. We term this behavior knot-scribbling and have found that it is influenced by stress and arousal. Knot-scribbling could function as a way for mice to obtain an overview of the entire environment, allowing them to re-calibrate their internal map and compass directions.
 Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of death worldwide, and there is a need for new antifungal drugs. In this study, we identified a new ergoline compound, NGx04, that inhibits the growth of Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. NGx04 targets the lipid transfer protein Sec14p, which is essential for the growth of these fungi. We used high-resolution chemogenomics to identify the binding site of NGx04 in Sec14p and found that NGx04 competes with the lipid substrates of Sec14p. We also found that NGx04 is fungicidal against a fluconazole-resistant strain of C. neoformans. Our study provides genetic evidence that NGx04 inhibits fungal Sec14p and initial data supporting NGx04 as a novel antifungal starting point.
 Schistosomiasis is a debilitating disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The current treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel, which has been in use for decades. However, the widespread use of praziquantel has led to the emergence of drug-resistant parasites, highlighting the need for new antischistosomal drugs. In this study, we found that the antimalarial drug mefloquine has promising antischistosomal properties in mice. A single dose of mefloquine (200 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum resulted in high or complete total and female worm burden reductions (72.3%–100%). Importantly, high worm burden reductions were also observed for young developing stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum harbored in the mouse. Both mefloquine enantiomers resulted in high and comparable total and female worm burden reductions when given to mice with either a sub-patent or patent S. mansoni infection. Our findings hold promise for the development of a novel antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality. Further in vitro and in vivo studies have been launched to elucidate the possible mechanism of action and to study the effect of mefloquine on S. haematobium and other trematodes. It will be interesting to investigate whether mefloquine, which is widely and effectively used for the treatment of malaria, has an impact on schistosomiasis in areas where both malaria and schistosomiasis co-exist.
 Podoconiosis is a non-infectious disease that causes massive swelling of the lower legs. It was identified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. The geographical distribution of podoconiosis is incomplete, and this study aimed to map its distribution in Cameroon. The study used a multi-stage sampling design with stratification of the country by environmental risk of podoconiosis. Seven hundred and sixty-two villages from forty health districts in ten regions of Cameroon were surveyed. All individuals aged 15 years or older in the village were screened for lymphedema, and a clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoconiosis. Individuals with lymphedema were tested for circulating Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and specific IgG4 using the Alere Filariasis Test Strips (FTS) test and the Standard Diagnostics (SD) BIOLINE lymphatic filariasis IgG4 test (Wb123) respectively, in addition to thick blood films. Presence of DNA specific to W. bancrofti was checked on night blood using a qPCR technique. Overall, 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated in the study. In total, 83 individuals with lymphedema were identified. Of the 83 individuals with lymphedema, two were found to be FTS positive and all were negative using the Wb123 test. No microfilaria of W. bancrofti were found in the night blood of any individual with clinical lymphedema. None were found to be positive for W. bancrofti using qPCR. Of the two FTS positive cases, one was positive for Mansonella perstans DNA, while the other harbored Loa loa microfilaria. Overall, 52 people with podoconiosis were identified after applying the clinical algorithm. The overall prevalence of podoconiosis was found to be 0.5% (95% confidence interval CI; 0.4–0.7). At least one case of podoconiosis was found in every region of Cameroon except the two surveyed villages in Adamawa. Of the 40 health districts surveyed, 17 districts had no cases of podoconiosis; in 15 districts, mean prevalence was between 0.2% and 1.0%; and in the remaining eight, mean prevalence was between 1.2% and 2.7%. Our investigation has demonstrated low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon. Designing a podoconiosis control program is a vital next step. A health system response to the burden of podoconiosis is important through case surveillance and morbidity management services.
 The ovary of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a well-studied model for understanding the biology of stem cells. The stem cells in the ovary, called germline stem cells (GSCs), are housed in a specialized niche that provides them with the necessary signals to maintain their stemness. As the fly ages, the number of GSCs in the niche decreases, but the reasons for this decline are not well understood. In this study, we found that Notch signaling, a pathway that plays a crucial role in stem cell biology, is increased in GSCs as they age. This increase in Notch signaling leads to the loss of GSCs from the niche. We also found that Notch signaling in the niche cells, which maintain the integrity of the niche, is decreased as the fly ages. These findings suggest that Notch signaling plays a key role in regulating the niche residency of GSCs during aging.
 The human herpesviruses (HHVs) are a group of viruses that cause a wide range of diseases, including chickenpox, shingles, and mononucleosis. These viruses have a unique feature in that they encode their own protein kinases, which are important for viral replication and gene expression. In this study, the authors investigated the function of a group of these protein kinases called the conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs). They found that the CHPKs from the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus families had Cdk-like activity, meaning they could phosphorylate the cellular retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein and lamin A/C proteins, which are also substrates of cellular Cdks. They also found that the CHPKs could disrupt the nuclear lamina. However, the CHPKs from the alpha-herpesvirus family did not have these functions. The authors conclude that the CHPKs are important for viral replication and gene expression, and that they may be potential targets for antiviral drugs.
 Melioidosis is a bacterial infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei . It is a rare but serious disease that can be fatal if left untreated. The disease is present in many tropical countries, but the global distribution of B. pseudomallei in the environment is not well understood. To address this, a working party was formed to develop consensus guidelines for the detection of environmental B. pseudomallei. The guidelines aim to reduce the probability of false-negative results and provide a low-tech methodology that is applicable in both developed and developing countries. The proposed guidelines provide the basis for the development of an accurate and comprehensive global map of environmental B. pseudomallei.
 The mechanism of membrane fusion by “class II” viral fusion proteins involves large-scale domain rearrangements of the envelope glycoprotein ( E ) and a transition from dimers to trimers . The rearrangement is believed to proceed by an outward rotation of the E ectodomain after loss of the dimer interface , followed by a reassociation into extended trimers . The ∼55-aa-residue , membrane proximal “stem” can then zip up along domain II , bringing together the transmembrane segments of the C-terminus and the fusion loops at the tip of domain II . We find that peptides derived from the stem of dengue-virus E bind stem-less E trimer , which models a conformational intermediate . In vitro assays demonstrate that these peptides specifically block viral fusion . The peptides inhibit infectivity with potency proportional to their affinity for the conformational intermediate , even when free peptide is removed from a preincubated inoculum before infecting cells . We conclude that peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes , the compartment in which acidification initiates fusion . Binding depends on particle dynamics , as there is no inhibition of infectivity if preincubation and separation are at 4°C rather than 37°C . We propose a two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition . Targeting a viral entry pathway can be an effective way to block infection . Our data , which support and extend proposed mechanisms for how the E conformational change promotes membrane fusion , suggest strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry .
 Cholera is a major global health concern, with an estimated 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually. Recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen highlight the need for rapid and accurate molecular analysis of Vibrio cholerae strains. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of stool specimens enriched in alkaline peptone water (APW) and V. cholerae culture isolates spotted on filter paper provides valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings. WGS identified the presence of co-infecting pathogens while providing rare insight into the specific V. cholerae strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas. This study demonstrates the potential of WGS to inform public health decisions by providing essential information on cholera genotype and co-infection burden.
 Epithelial cells are a type of cell that form a layer of tissue that lines organs and provides protection and support. These cells have a specific arrangement of proteins on their surface that helps them function properly. However, the mechanisms that control the arrangement of these proteins are not well understood. In this study, researchers used a genetic screen to identify proteins that are important for the proper arrangement of these proteins. They found that a protein called Dynein is important for the proper arrangement of these proteins. Dynein is a motor protein that moves cargo along microtubules. The researchers found that Dynein works with a protein called Stardust to move a specific type of mRNA to the apical surface of the epithelial cells. This mRNA codes for a protein called Crumbs, which is important for the proper arrangement of proteins on the surface of the epithelial cells. The researchers also found that the arrangement of these proteins changes as the epithelial cells mature. This study provides new insights into how the proper arrangement of proteins on the surface of epithelial cells is controlled.
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania. It is transmitted by the bite of infected sand flies and can cause a range of symptoms depending on the species of Leishmania and the host. While the reproductive cycle of Leishmania is thought to be mostly clonal, recent studies have suggested that sexual reproduction may also occur. In this study, the authors used transgenic L. infantum lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters to investigate whether these parasites can recognize and mate with the same genotype. They found that yellow hybrid progeny was produced when individuals from the same species were fed to sand flies together, suggesting that intraclonal genetic exchange can occur in L. infantum. The hybrid progeny was stable throughout the parasite life cycle and had reduced virulence in mice. These findings provide evidence for intraclonal genetic exchange in L. infantum and suggest that this may be a common occurrence in other Leishmania species.
 Leishmaniasis is a major health problem in Ethiopia, caused by different parasites transmitted by different vectors in different regions. We here characterize 63 L. donovani strains isolated from patients in north and south Ethiopia using PCR targeting three regions: ITS1, cpb, and HASPB. ITS1- and cpb- PCR identified these strains as L. donovani. The k26- PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia (36/40) produced a 290 bp product with a minority (4/40) giving a 410 bp amplicon. All of the latter strains were isolated from patients with HIV-VL co-infections, while the former group contained both VL and HIV-VL co-infected patients. Almost all the strains (20/23) from southwestern Ethiopia produced a 450 bp amplicon with smaller products (290 or 360 bp) only observed for three strains. Sudanese strains produced amplicons identical (290 bp) to those found in northwestern Ethiopia; while Kenyan strains gave larger PCR products (500 and 650 bp). HASPB repeat region (k26) shows considerable polymorphism among L. donovani strains from different regions. This should be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen.
 HIV-1 is a highly diverse virus that is constantly evolving due to its high mutation rate and tendency to switch between different RNA templates during replication. This diversity is partitioned into distinct phylogenetic clusters known as subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). It is widely assumed that some of these recombinant forms have novel properties that led to their prevalence, particularly in the case of CRFs. In this study, we generated a probabilistic model of HIV-1 copy-choice recombination and compared the predicted breakpoint distribution to the distribution from the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We found that the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination were predicted accurately by our model across much of the HIV-1 genome, indicating that in these regions a probabilistic model dependent on local sequence identity is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. However, in regions where there is a significant over- or under-representation of breakpoints, we infer natural selection to be influencing the recombination pattern. Our findings thus provide the first clear indication of the existence of a specific portion of the genome that deviates from a probabilistic null model for recombination. This suggests that, despite the wide diversity of recombinant forms seen in the viral population, only a minority of recombination events appear to be of significance to the evolution of HIV-1.
 Computational modeling is increasingly used in neuroscience research to analyze experimental data. However, statistical methods used to address two interdependent problems, parameter estimation and model comparison, have limitations. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework that addresses both problems simultaneously. Our framework has several advantages over previous methods, including smaller errors in parameter estimation and robustness against outliers in model comparison. Furthermore, our fully Bayesian approach enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by performing HBI t-test. We demonstrate the advantages of our method through synthetic and empirical datasets.
The brainstem is a complex structure that plays a crucial role in sensory and motor functions. During development, the hindbrain becomes subdivided into rhombomeres (r), which are serially repeated segments of progenitor cells. Individual rhombomeres give rise to distinct portions of sensory and motor columns, and topographic patterns of connectivity. In this study, the authors show that r4 contributes to functionally linked sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei, and motor olivocochlear neurons. Assembly of the r4-derived auditory components is involved in sound perception and depends on regulatory interactions between Hoxb1 and Hoxb2. In Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 mutant mice, the transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is lost, resulting in hearing impairments. On the other hand, Hoxa2 regulates the Rig1 axon guidance receptor and controls contralateral projections from the anterior ventral cochlear nuclei to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. Thus, individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem.
 The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 ( Sde 2-40 ) is a newly discovered species that can degrade a wide range of complex polysaccharides, including cellulose, chitin, and pectin. Its complete genome sequence has been determined, revealing an unusually large number of enzymes that degrade these polysaccharides. Many of these enzymes have unusual architecture, including novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules. We hypothesize that these features are adaptations that facilitate depolymerization of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment. Sde 2-40 is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium that can degrade plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle that is not well-characterized in the marine environment. The genome of Sde 2-40 contains 4008 genes in a single replicon consisting of 5.06 Mb. The genome annotation reveals that Sde 2-40 is unique in its variety of depolymerases and unusual in its number of open reading frames coding for complex polysaccharide depolymerases. These carbohydrases and related proteins, comprising 10% of the genome, contain extraordinary modularity, interesting architecture, and a remarkable proportion of membrane targeting domains. Although such an arrangement is limited to few taxa, the bacteria within these taxa appear to be widely distributed in marine and estuarine waters.
 Japanese Encephalitis virus ( JEV ) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes viral neurological infections in children throughout Asia . The virus has shifted from genotype III ( GIII ) to genotype I ( GI ) in recent years, but the exact mechanism of this displacement is unknown. We used Cx . pipiens mosquitoes from China as an in vivo mosquito model to explore if mosquitoes played a potential role in JEV genotype shift. We exposed female Cx . pipiens mosquitoes orally to either GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, whole mosquitoes, secondary organs, and salivary glands of JEV-infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days of post infection ( dpi ) and subjected to measure the infection rate, replication kinetics, dissemination rate, and transmission potential of the infected JEV strains in Cx . pipiens mosquitoes by 50% tissue culture infective dose assay. We found that Cx . pipiens mosquitoes were competent vector for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. Our experiment data demonstrated that GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in Cx . pipiens mosquitoes, suggesting that Cx . pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift. Although the current data were obtained solely from Cx . pipiens mosquitoes, it is likely that the conclusion drawn could be extrapolated to the role of mosquitoes in JEV genotype shift.
 Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Malaysia has experienced large dengue outbreaks in recent years, with a significant increase in cases from 2000 to 2014. We conducted a retrospective review of all dengue deaths that occurred in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014. Our study found that the mean age of dengue deaths was 40.7 years, with half of the cases being adults and 72.5% of them having co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. The most common warning signs reported were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children and abdominal pain being more common in adults. However, 22.4% of the cases did not have any warning signs. Only 34% of the cases were suspected of dengue illness at their initial presentation. More adults developed severe plasma leakage, and more than half of the cases suffered from multi-organ involvement. Dengue shock syndrome was the leading cause of death, regardless of age groups. Our study highlights the dynamic progression of severe dengue infections and the importance of early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent deaths.
 In this study, we investigated the relationship between insulin signaling and attractiveness in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We found that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells affects female attractiveness, and that these effects are opposite in direction. We also found that modulation of insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells affects fecundity in the corresponding direction. Furthermore, we found that the cues that reflect insulin pathway activity are distinct in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells. Our results suggest that the fruit fly uses a combination of signals from different tissues to assess attractiveness and fecundity.
 The Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) epidemic in West Africa in 2013–2015 spread heterogeneously across the three hardest-hit countries Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone . To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD , we applied a statistical modelling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number ( R0 ) for each affected district and each country using weekly incident case numbers . We estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak using exponential regression of the case counts on the first eight weeks since onset . To take into account the heterogeneity between and within countries , we fitted a mixed effects model and calculated R0 based on the predicted individual growth rates and the reported serial interval distribution . At district level , R0 ranged from 0 . 36 ( Dubréka ) to 1 . 72 ( Beyla ) in Guinea , from 0 . 53 ( Maryland ) to 3 . 37 ( Margibi ) in Liberia and from 1 . 14 ( Koinadugu ) to 2 . 73 ( Western Rural ) in Sierra Leone . At national level , we estimated an R0 of 0 . 97 ( 95% CI 0 . 77–1 . 18 ) for Guinea , 1 . 26 ( 95% CI 0 . 98–1 . 55 ) for Liberia and 1 . 66 ( 95% CI 1 . 32–2 . 00 ) for Sierra Leone . Socio-demographic variables related to urbanisation such as high population density and high wealth index were found positively associated with R0 suggesting that the consequences of fast urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD .
 The evolutionary rate of proteins is a topic of great interest in the field of biology. Several factors have been proposed to influence the evolutionary rate of proteins, including protein designability, solvent exposure, and age. However, it is unclear how these factors interact to determine the evolutionary rate of proteins. In this study, we used a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped PDB structures to investigate the interplay of structural properties and evolutionary age as determinants of protein evolutionary rate. We found that previously observed structural correlations also hold within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and evolutionary rates. However, age modulates the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate. Additionally, younger proteins tend to evolve faster than older ones, despite being less designable. We show that previously reported relationships between age and rate cannot be explained by structural biases among age groups. Finally, we introduce a knowledge-based potential function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation. We find that older proteins are more stable for their native structure and more robust to mutations than younger ones. Our results underscore that several determinants, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution.
 Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) is a protein complex that regulates gene expression during development and differentiation. It contains several core components, including Suz12, Ezh2, and Eed, which trimethylate lysine 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27me3 ). Polycomb-like ( Pcl ) proteins are accessory proteins that modulate PRC2 function. Here, we show that Pcl3 is a component of PRC2 that promotes ESC self-renewal. We found that Pcl3 interacts with core PRC2 components and promotes H3K27me3 formation. Depletion of Pcl3 in ESCs causes decreased H3K27me3 and Suz12 binding to the genome, indicating that Pcl3 regulates PRC2 binding at diverse target genes. Pcl3 localizes with Suz12 at a subset of PRC2 targets, including genes and microRNAs associated with differentiation and development. We also identified two GC-rich binding motifs that are enriched at Pcl3-dependent PRC2 targets, indicating that Pcl3 promotes PRC2 binding at CpG islands. Taken together, these results reveal that Pcl3 is an important regulator of PRC2 at a subset of target genes.
 In this study, the authors investigate how feeding state affects the expression of a chemoreceptor gene in the ADL sensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that the expression of the chemoreceptor gene srh-234 is regulated by the transcription factor MEF-2 in a feeding-state dependent manner. They also found that MEF-2 acts together with bHLH transcription factors to regulate srh-234 expression. The authors show that HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4 are expressed in ADL neurons and regulate srh-234 expression, while HLH-30 is expressed in the intestine and regulates srh-234 expression remotely. They also show that insulin signaling in ADL neurons is required for this non-cell-autonomous regulation of srh-234 expression. The authors suggest that MEF-2 and bHLH transcriptional factors link feeding state conditions via insulin signaling to the regulation of chemoreceptor genes in chemosensory neurons.
 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a destructive skin condition caused by infection with the environmental bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans . The mode of transmission of M . ulcerans is not completely understood, but several studies have explored the role of biting insects. In this study, we tested for an association between the detection of M . ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of BU disease in humans in an endemic area of southeastern Australia. We found a strong dose-response relationship between the detection of M . ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease ( r , 0.99; 95% CI , 0.92–0.99; p<0.001 ). The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the transmission of M . ulcerans in southeastern Australia. This has implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU.
 The rat demyelination ( dmy ) mutation is a unique model for studying the maintenance of myelin in the central nervous system ( CNS ). We have now identified the causative gene as Mrs2, which encodes a protein that is an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria. This protein is expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelin production. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of myelin has a different mechanism from its initial production and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin. This discovery provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying myelin maintenance and may lead to new therapies for demyelinating diseases.
 Microarray gene expression signatures have the potential to be powerful tools for patient stratification, diagnosis of disease, prognosis of survival, assessment of risk group, and selection of treatment. However, these signatures need to be communicated to other healthcare centers with data for external evaluation and ultimately to practitioners for use in clinical routine. This requires unambiguous documentation of the signature. We found that discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as frequent as 30% and 18% respectively. By using the proposed documentation by value strategy, which documents quantitative preprocessing information, the median discrepancy was reduced to 1%. Our approach reduces ambiguity of diagnoses to a minimum.
 Amyloid fibrils are protein structures that are involved in a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In bacteria, amyloid fibrils are involved in biofilm formation, which is a process by which bacteria form communities that are resistant to environmental stressors. In this study, the authors present the crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, CsgA, revealing steric zipper fibrils of tightly mated β-sheets. They also found that D-enantiomeric peptides, originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-β, inhibited CsgA fibrillation and reduced biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. The authors suggest that their findings provide structural insights into a biofilm-related amyloid, which could have bearing on amyloid diseases by cross-seeding and the creation of transmissible agents.
 Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a serious disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and is endemic in most of Asia. It is a significant public health threat, with high case fatality rates and often significant neurologic sequelae among survivors. The epidemiology of JE in the Philippines is not well defined. To support consideration of JE vaccine for introduction into the national schedule in the Philippines, we conducted a systematic literature review and summarized JE surveillance data from 2011 to 2014. We identified 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 reports of clinical cases, and 8 animal studies. JEV was the causative agent in 7% to 18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16% to 40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age and 6% to 7% of cases resulted in death. Surveillance data from January 2011 to March 2014 identified 73 (15%) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested. This comprehensive review demonstrates the endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines, and supports the use of JE vaccine in the country. Continued and improved surveillance with laboratory confirmation is needed to systematically quantify the burden of JE, to provide information that can guide prioritization of high-risk areas in the country and determination of appropriate age and schedule of vaccine introduction, and to measure the impact of preventive measures including immunization against this important public health threat.
 We developed a computational model to study the evolution of metabolic robustness in bacteria. Our model combines two existing methods to predict the minimal set of externally acquired compounds and the set of all possible metabolites that can be produced from a set of compounds. We used this model to study the level of robustness across bacterial species and decoupled between robustness which is condition-dependent and robustness which is condition-independent. We found that environmental robustness is associated with the intrinsic metabolic capacities of a species, such as higher growth rates or the production of secondary metabolites. We also found that environmental robustness is a byproduct of the evolution of metabolic networks, and that it is not directly selected for. Our model provides a new framework for studying the evolution of metabolic robustness and its relationship to other adaptive traits.
The study aimed to investigate the effects of schistosoma infection on responses to childhood measles catch-up immunisation and the effect of praziquantel treatment on this outcome in a randomised trial. The Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunisation (IMoChI) study was based in Entebbe, Uganda. Children aged 3–5 years (193 S. mansoni-infected and 61 uninfected) were enrolled. Infected children were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive praziquantel 2 weeks before, at time of, or 1 week after measles catch-up immunisation. Plasma anti-measles IgG was measured at enrolment, 1 week and 24 weeks after measles immunisation. Primary outcomes were IgG levels and percentage of participants with levels considered protective against measles. Anti-measles IgG levels increased following immunisation, but at 1 week post-immunisation S. mansoni-infected, compared to uninfected, children had lower levels of anti-measles IgG (aGMR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2–0.7] ) and the percentage with protective antibody levels was also lower (aOR 0.1 [0–0.9]). Among S. mansoni-infected children, anti-measles IgG one week post-immunisation was higher among those treated with praziquantel than among those who were not yet treated (treatment before immunisation aGMR 2.3 [1.5–4.8]; treatment at immunisation aGMR 1.8 [1.1–3.5]). At 24 weeks post-immunisation, IgG levels did not differ between the trial groups, but tended to be lower among previously-infected children who were still S. mansoni stool-positive than among those who became stool-negative. The findings suggest that S. mansoni infection among pre-school children is associated with a reduced antibody response to catch-up measles immunisation, and that praziquantel treatment improves the response. S. mansoni infection may contribute to impaired vaccine responses in endemic populations; effective schistosomiasis control may be beneficial for vaccine efficacy. This should be further explored.
 The evolution of bacterial populations has become better understood through large-scale sequencing of population samples. However, traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, are associated with several difficulties under such an extensive sampling scenario, particularly when a considerable amount of recombination is anticipated. To meet the needs of large-scale analyses of population structure for bacteria, we introduce several statistical tools for the detection and representation of recombination between populations. We also introduce a model-based description of the shape of a population in sequence space, in terms of its molecular variability and affinity towards other populations. Extensive real data from the genus Neisseria are utilized to demonstrate the potential of an approach where these population genetic tools are combined with an phylogenetic analysis. The statistical tools introduced here are freely available in BAPS 5 software, which can be downloaded from http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf/mate/jc/software/baps.html.
20 Hz beta rhythms have been linked to attention and are thought to be generated in higher cognitive areas. A computational model of sensory cortical areas was built to investigate the functional roles of beta rhythms and the underlying mechanisms. The simulation results show that top-down beta rhythms can activate ascending synaptic projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, which are responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons were shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate the activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. The predicted critical roles of these cells in attentional gain provide a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention.
 The emergence of new human pathogens is a growing concern in public health. Accurate estimates of epidemic parameters during the initial phase of disease emergence are crucial for effective public health policy decisions. However, this is challenging due to the stochastic nature of the epidemic dynamics and the limited availability of data. In this study, we propose a novel calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. Our method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), uses a linear noise approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the true epidemic state with each new observation. We compare the performance of MSS with three benchmark methods and find that MSS significantly outperforms them in most epidemic scenarios. Our method provides accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters and can predict the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. These findings suggest that MSS is a promising tool for calibrating and predicting stochastic epidemic models using limited data.
 In the present work, we show that human visual perception is constantly shaped by two contrasting forces exerted by sensory adaptation and past decisions. In a series of experiments, we used multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. Our results revealed that each perceptual report is permeated by opposite biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes: Low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional traces attract perceptual reports toward the recent past. In this hierarchy of serial dependence, “continuity fields” arise from the inertia of decisional templates and not from low-level sensory processes. This finding is consistent with a Two-process model of serial dependence in which the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. We propose a unified account of serial dependence in which functionally distinct mechanisms, operating at different stages, promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.
 The circadian clock is a biological system that regulates daily rhythms in living organisms. In Drosophila, the core circadian clock consists of two transcription factors, Clock and Cycle (CLK–CYC). Recent studies have shown that post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating the activity of CLK–CYC. However, the role of transcription in core circadian function remains unclear. To address this question, we analyzed the effects of a fusion protein of Cycle and the viral protein 16 (VP16) in Drosophila. We found that the addition of VP16 to Cycle enhanced the transcriptional activity of CLK–CYC, leading to increased levels of CLK–CYC target gene mRNAs and a shortened period. These results suggest that transcription plays a crucial role in core circadian function in Drosophila.
 We have identified a mechanism by which a horizontally acquired gene product can activate an ancestral pathway in a different bacterial species. The Salmonella PmrD protein binds to the phosphorylated PmrA protein ( PmrA-P ) , protecting it from dephosphorylation by the PmrB protein . This results in transcription of PmrA-dependent genes , including those conferring polymyxin B resistance . We now report that the E . coli PmrD protein can activate the PmrA/PmrB system in Salmonella even though it cannot do it in E . coli , suggesting that these two species differ in an additional component controlling PmrA-P levels . We establish that the E . coli PmrB displays higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella PmrB , and we identified a PmrB subdomain responsible for this property . Replacement of the E . coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog was sufficient to render E . coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions . Our findings provide a singular example whereby quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of orthologous ancestral proteins dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits . And they suggest that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral loci .
 The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is a complex process that involves the expression of specific genes. To identify the genes that regulate differentiation, researchers have traditionally compared the gene expression of differentiated and undifferentiated cells. However, this approach can lead to a large number of false positives because it includes genes that respond to differentiation rather than regulate it. In this study, the authors developed a new statistical approach to identify differentially expressed genes at the early stages of differentiation without prior separation of cell types. They applied this approach to analyze the differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells and identified Smarcad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal. The authors formalized their statistical approach as a statistical test that is generally applicable to analyze other differentiation processes. This study provides a new tool for identifying genes that regulate differentiation and may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying differentiation.
 We have developed a new method to identify functional associations between genes implicated in the same disease. We control for confounding bias in coding-sequence length and find that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. We present a tool that identifies functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias. Our method is suitable for functionally subclustering the gene variants underlying a polygenic disorder.
 In 2014, Mexico implemented an 8% tax on nonessential foods with high energy density and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The objective of this study was to examine changes in the volume of taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases in response to these taxes in the entire sample and stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). This study uses data on household packaged food purchases representative of the Mexican urban population from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services (CPS). We analyzed the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014, using a longitudinal, fixed-effects model that adjusted for preexisting trends to test whether the observed post-tax trend was significantly different from the one expected based on the pre-tax trend. We controlled for household characteristics and contextual factors like minimum salary and unemployment rate. The mean volume of purchases of taxed foods in 2014 changed by -25 g (95% confidence interval = -46, -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1% change beyond what would have been expected based on pre-tax (2012-2013) trends, with no corresponding change in purchases of untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased on average 10.2% less taxed foods than expected (-44 [–72, –16] g per capita per month); medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods than expected (-28 [–46, –11] g per capita per month), whereas high SES households’ purchases did not change. The main limitations of our findings are the inability to infer causality because the taxes were implemented at the national level (lack of control group), our sample is only representative of urban areas, we only have 2 y of data prior to the tax, and, as with any consumer panel survey, we did not capture all foods purchased by the household. Household purchases of nonessential energy-dense foods declined in the first year after the implementation of Mexico’s SSB and nonessential foods taxes. Future studies should evaluate the impact of the taxes on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns.
η-like response properties are observed in collision-sensitive neurons, such as the Lobula Giant Movement Detector ( LGMD ) neuron of the locust. A biophysically plausible model of these neurons is presented, which assumes that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. The model predicts many response characteristics of the LGMD, including the time between the peak at Tmax and collision ( Trel ), and the coincidence of the maximum LGMD activity with the angular size Θ ( tmax ). The model also suggests that the LGMD uses a power law for scaling its inhibitory input, and that the response curve to approaching objects would be significantly distorted without this scaling. The model emphasizes the importance of signal integration in order to account for many reported experimental observations.
 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans that leads to necrotizing ulcers and deformities if left untreated. BU is endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions near stagnant or slow flowing water bodies and marshlands. Cameroon began institutional BU control in 2002 and has made significant progress in the past 14 years. The number of BU endemic health districts has increased from two to 64, and five BU diagnostic and treatment centers are currently functional. The health system has been strengthened, and BU research and education have gained more interest in Cameroon. However, resource allocation remains a major challenge for scaling up BU control activities in the country.
 We investigated how the valence of outcomes (gains or losses) affects confidence judgments in a reinforcement learning task. We found that individuals were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. This bias was driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the expected value of choice options. We also found that this biasing effect of context-value on confidence was domain-general, with likely important functional consequences. We show that one such consequence emerges in volatile environments, where the flexibility of individuals’ learning strategies differs when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. Despite apparent similar behavior, profound asymmetries might exist between learning to avoid losses and learning to seek gains.
 The alphavirus nsP3 protein is a component of the viral replication complex and is composed of a conserved aminoterminal macro domain and a poorly conserved carboxyterminal region. Despite the lack of overall homology, we found that the carboxyterminal proline-rich sequence motif shared by many alphaviral nsP3 proteins serves as a preferred target site for the Src-homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains of amphiphysin-1 and -2. Nsp3 proteins of Semliki Forest ( SFV ) , Sindbis ( SINV ) , and Chikungunya viruses all showed avid and SH3-dependent binding to amphiphysins. Upon alphavirus infection, the intracellular distribution of amphiphysin was dramatically altered and colocalized with nsP3. Mutations in nsP3 disrupting the amphiphysin SH3 binding motif as well as RNAi-mediated silencing of amphiphysin-2 expression resulted in impaired viral RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SFV. Infection of Balb/c mice with SFV carrying an SH3 binding-defective nsP3 was associated with significantly decreased mortality. These data establish SH3 domain-mediated binding of nsP3 with amphiphysin as an important host cell interaction promoting alphavirus replication.
Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin caused by melanized fungi. In Brazil, the disease is caused by members of the order Chaetothyriales, with Fonsecaea pedrosoi being the most prevalent agent. The present study assessed the population diversity of 123 clinical strains of agents of the disease in Brazil using sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region, and partial cell division cycle and β-tubulin genes. The study found that F. pedrosoi was the most prevalent agent, followed by F. monophora and F. nubica. Additional agents, including two novel species, were located among members of the genus Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora. The study provides an enumeration of currently proven cases with molecular support in endemic areas in Brazil and highlights the importance of molecular identification for accurate diagnosis and treatment of chromoblastomycosis.
 The DNA damage response ( DDR ) is a crucial signaling pathway that detects and repairs DNA damage caused by endogenous or exogenous factors. In this study, we investigated the impact of Listeria monocytogenes infection on the DDR in human cells. We found that infection with L. monocytogenes induces DNA breaks, but only moderately activates the DDR. We discovered that the bacterial toxin LLO degrades the sensor Mre11, which is crucial for engaging the downstream response. We also found that inhibition of proteins involved in the DDR promotes bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism for the control of infection. Our study uncovers a subversion of the DDR during infection by L. monocytogenes and a role for the DDR in blocking bacterial proliferation.
Herpes simplex virus-1 and -2 (HSV-1, HSV-2) are common pathogens of human diseases. Both host and viral factors are involved in HSV lytic infection, although detailed mechanisms remain elusive. By screening a chemical library of epigenetic regulation, we identified bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) as a critical player in HSV infection. We show that treatment with pan BD domain inhibitor enhanced both HSV infection and using JQ1 as a probe, we found that JQ1, a defined BD1 inhibitor, acts through BRD4 protein since knockdown of BRD4 expression ablated JQ1 effect on HSV infection. BRD4 regulates HSV replication through complex formation involving CDK9 and RNAP II; whereas, JQ1 promotes HSV-1 infection by allocating the complex to HSV gene promoters. Therefore, suppression of BRD4 expression or inhibition of CDK9 activity impeded HSV infection. Our data support a model that JQ1 enhances HSV infection by switching BRD4 to transcription regulation of viral gene expression from chromatin targeting since transient expression of BRD4 BD1 or BD1/2 domain had similar effect to that by JQ1 treatment. In addition to the identification that BRD4 is a modulator for JQ1 action on HSV infection, this study demonstrates BRD4 has an essential role in HSV infection.
 Noma, also known as cancrum oris, is a devastating ancient disease that causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140,000 children worldwide each year. The cause of noma is still unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of factors including malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, and a weakened immune system. To understand the microbial ecology of noma, we performed a cross-sectional sequencing study of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 60 samples of gingival fluid from 12 healthy children, 12 children with noma (lesion and healthy sites), and 12 children with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG) (lesion and healthy sites). We found that samples taken from lesions in diseased mouths were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted for Proteobacteria, while samples taken from healthy sites of diseased mouths had proportions of Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria that were similar to healthy control individuals. We also found that samples from noma mouths did not have a higher abundance of Fusobacterium, casting doubt on its role as a causative agent of noma. Microbial communities sampled from noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU, which was much less abundant in healthy sites sampled from the same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed that bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different. Several OTUs in the Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales were identified as indicators of noma, suggesting that one or more microbes within these Orders is associated with the development of noma lesions. Future studies should include longitudinal sampling of viral and microbial components of this community, before and early in noma lesion development.
 Bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate their behavior in response to environmental cues. The infectious cycle of Bacillus thuringiensis in the insect host is a powerful model to investigate the role of quorum sensing in natural conditions. The RNPP family of regulators, including NprR, is involved in quorum sensing and regulates gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. Here, we show that NprR, in the absence of bound peptide, negatively controls sporulation by preventing the initiation of the sporulation process. NprR inhibits expression of Spo0A-regulated genes by preventing the KinA-dependent phosphorylation of the phosphotransferase Spo0F. This NprR function displays striking similarities with the Rap proteins, which also belong to the RNPP family but are devoid of DNA-binding domain and indirectly control gene expression via protein-protein interactions. We propose a molecular regulatory mechanism in which key residues of the bifunctional regulator NprR are directly and alternatively involved in its two functions. NprX binding switches NprR from a dimeric inhibitor of sporulation to a tetrameric transcriptional activator involved in the necrotrophic lifestyle of B. thuringiensis. NprR thus tightly coordinates sporulation and necrotrophism, ensuring survival and dissemination of the bacteria during host infection.
 HIV is a virus that causes AIDS, and it is treated with a combination of drugs. However, some HIV strains are resistant to certain drugs, and it is important to know which drugs will be effective against a particular strain. In this study, we used a large dataset of HIV mutants and their corresponding drug sensitivities to create a model that can predict which drugs will be effective against a particular strain. We used a technique called proteochemometric modeling, which combines information about the chemical properties of drugs with information about the genetic properties of HIV strains. We found that our model was able to accurately predict which drugs would be effective against a particular strain of HIV, even if that strain had not been previously tested. This could be useful in the clinic, where doctors need to know which drugs will be effective against a particular patient's strain of HIV.
 The mechanism of eukaryotic chemotaxis, the movement of cells towards a source of attractants, is not well understood despite extensive research. A recent study proposed a pseudopod-based mechanism in which cells migrate by a self-generated cycle of pseudopod formation and retraction. The study used a computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on this mechanism to test its explanatory and predictive powers. The model reproduced a wide range of existing data about cell movement and chemotaxis, including cell polarization and persistence without stimuli and selection of accurate pseudopods when chemoattractant gradients are present. The model also predicted novel behaviors, such as lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients and an increase in the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient. The authors measured the angles between pseudopods in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells under different conditions and found the results agreed with the model extremely well. The study suggests that in rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils, an intrinsic pseudopod cycle lies at the heart of cell motility. This implies that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behavior, more than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants.
Yersinia pestis is a bacterium that causes plague in humans and animals. It is transmitted by fleas, which become infected when they feed on a rodent with plague. There are two ways that fleas can transmit Y. pestis: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). EPT occurs when a flea feeds on a rodent with plague and then transmits the bacteria to a new rodent within 4 days. BDT occurs when a flea feeds on a rodent with plague and then transmits the bacteria to a new rodent after 5-7 days, when a biofilm has formed in the flea's digestive tract. In this study, we found that fleas that fed on rat blood were more likely to transmit Y. pestis by BDT than by EPT. We also found that fleas that fed on rat blood were more likely to have a physical blockage in their digestive tract, which could interfere with their ability to transmit Y. pestis by EPT. These findings suggest that the source of the infectious blood meal can affect the way that fleas transmit Y. pestis.
 The brain is a complex system that processes information from the environment to make decisions. One of the most important aspects of this information processing is the encoding of sensory information into neural activity. In this study, we investigate how the encoding of sensory information is affected by correlations in the activity of neurons. We find that correlations can enhance the coding performance of a neural population by many orders of magnitude. Specifically, we show that the probability of discrimination error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude and the number of stimuli encoded can be enhanced more than tenfold. These effects are robust to variations in the additional (‘untuned’) parameters in the system. We also discuss the nature of the pattern of correlation that leads to this enhancement and suggest experimental tests to identify it.
Cholera is a severe watery diarrhea caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Protection against cholera is serogroup specific, meaning that vaccines must be tailored to the specific strain of V. cholerae causing the outbreak. Here, we describe a conjugate vaccine for cholera prepared via squaric acid chemistry from the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain PIC018 and a recombinant heavy chain fragment of tetanus toxin (OSP:rTTHc). We assessed a range of vaccine doses based on the OSP content of the vaccine, vaccine compositions varying by molar loading ratio of OSP to rTTHc, effect of an adjuvant, and route of immunization. Immunized mice developed prominent anti-OSP and anti-TT serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses following intramuscular or intradermal vaccination. In general, we found comparable immune responses in mice immunized with these variations, although memory B cell and vibriocidal responses were blunted in mice receiving the highest dose of vaccine (50 μg). We found no appreciable change in immune responses when the conjugate vaccine was administered in the presence or absence of immunoadjuvant alum. Administration of OSP:rTTHc resulted in 55% protective efficacy in a mouse survival cholera challenge model. We report development of an Inaba OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine that induces memory responses and protection against cholera in mice. Development of an effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high level and long-term immune responses against OSP would be beneficial, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.
 Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating disease caused by parasitic worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a goal to eliminate LF by 2020 through mass drug administration (MDA) programs. However, the success of these programs depends on accurate mapping of the disease to identify areas that need treatment. The immunochromatographic card test (ICT) is a rapid and easy-to-use test that has been widely used for mapping LF. However, recent studies have raised concerns about the specificity of the test, particularly in areas where loiasis, a disease caused by a different parasite, is highly endemic. This study aimed to investigate the cross-reactivity of the ICT when mapping LF in areas with contrasting levels of loiasis and mansonellosis endemicity in Cameroon. The study found that ICT positivity was strongly associated with high L. loa Mf prevalence and intensity, but not with M. perstans prevalence or intensity. These findings suggest that the ICT may not be suitable for mapping LF in areas where loiasis is highly endemic. The study highlights the importance of considering the prevalence and intensity of other filarial parasites when interpreting ICT results in areas with co-endemicity.
 We have used electron tomography to study the three-dimensional structure of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations in infected cells. Our analysis reveals a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms. The network includes convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected double-membrane vesicles, and “vesicle packets” apparently arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits, while double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. Since we could not discern a connection between the DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. Our data document the extensive virus-induced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and may have important implications for the development of novel antiviral control strategies.
 In this study, we used the newly characterized esb1 mutant to establish a connection between suberin in the root and both water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves. We found that esb1 mutants, characterized by increased root suberin, had reduced daytime transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during their vegetative growth period. These changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreases in the accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn and increases in the accumulation of Na, S, K, As, Se, and Mo in the shoot. We also found that a significant component of the radial root transport of Ca, Mn, and Zn occurs in the apoplast. Our findings provide direct genetic evidence establishing that suberin in the roots plays a critical role in controlling both water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves.
 The single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction is regulated by the dynamics of R* during its lifetime, including the random number of phosphorylations, the catalytic activity, and the random sojourn time at each phosphorylation level. Because of this randomness, the electrical responses are expected to be inherently variable. However, the SPR is highly reproducible. The mechanisms that confer to the SPR such a low variability are not completely understood. The kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation is investigated by a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model parameters are extracted from the photoresponse data of both wild type and mutant mice, having variable numbers of phosphorylation sites, and, with the same set of parameters, the model reproduces both WT and mutant responses. The sources of variability are dissected into its components, by asking whether a random number of turnoff steps, a random sojourn time between steps, or both, give rise to the known variability. The model shows that only the randomness of the sojourn times in each of the phosphorylated states contributes to the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the response, whereas the randomness of the number of R* turnoff steps has a negligible effect. These results counter the view that the larger the number of decay steps of R*, the more stable the photoresponse is. Our results indicate that R* shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of the second messengers acts as a variability suppressor.
 We present a general mathematical framework for modeling biochemical systems that are influenced by extrinsic noise. Extrinsic noise refers to fluctuations in the environment that affect the system under study. We show how to incorporate these fluctuations into a new model that decouples the system from its environment. This allows us to analyze the system without considering the extrinsic noise explicitly. We demonstrate the significance of our approach using several case studies. Our framework provides a self-contained stochastic model that summarizes all system behaviors attainable under all possible realizations of the extrinsic fluctuations. This model emulates the effect of extrinsic noise by exploiting its own stochasticity, leading to a self-exciting process.
 We developed a novel closed-loop BMI training architecture that allows for processing, control, and adaptation using spike events, enables robust control, and extends to various tasks. The architecture incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control ( OFC ) model of the brain’s behavior in closed-loop BMI control, and a point process model of spikes. The OFC model infers the user’s motor intention during CLDA—a process termed intention estimation. OFC is also used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders; it also enables dynamic spike-event-based parameter adaptation unlike current CLDA methods that use batch-based adaptation on much slower adaptation time-scales. We conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to dissociate the effects of these novel CLDA components. The OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared with current intention estimation techniques. OFC assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control. Spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared with batch-based methods, and was robust to parameter initialization. Finally, the architecture extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training. These results have significant implications towards the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics.
 The retina is a complex sensory organ that processes visual information from the environment. In order to understand how the retina processes visual information, researchers have studied the responses of individual neurons to different types of visual stimuli. However, the responses of individual neurons do not always provide a complete picture of how the retina processes visual information. In this study, researchers investigated how the responses of pairs of neurons change in response to different types of visual stimuli. They found that the responses of pairs of neurons are more correlated when the visual stimuli are spatio-temporally structured, such as natural movies, than when the visual stimuli are unstructured, such as white noise checkerboards. They also found that the responses of pairs of neurons are less correlated when the visual stimuli are purely spatial than when the visual stimuli are spatio-temporally structured. These findings suggest that the retina may adjust its coding strategy to represent different types of visual stimuli efficiently.
 We have developed a new approach to predicting genetic interactions in yeast that is more effective and robust than previous methods. Our approach uses a multi-network and multi-classifier system that incorporates a wide range of independent features to capture the relationships between genes. We have also used this approach to predict genetic interactions between known transcription factors in yeast and to predict interactions among all non-essential gene pairs in yeast. Our results are available at http://sage.fhcrc.org/downloads/downloads/predicted_yeast_genetic_interactions.zip. Our approach is expected to be more effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions from the tens of millions of unknown gene pairs in yeast and from the hundreds of millions of gene pairs in higher organisms like mouse and human.
 The BRCA Challenge is a global initiative to develop a comprehensive, standardized, and secure system for sharing and curating data on BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. The BRCA Exchange is the central component of this initiative, providing a web portal and mobile application for variant annotation and sharing. The BRCA Exchange is built on a pipeline that merges variant data from multiple sources, including ClinVar , LOVD , BIC , and ExAC , and applies a set of classification criteria developed by the ENIGMA consortium to classify variants as benign or likely benign. The BRCA Exchange also provides a mobile application for variant annotation and sharing, which is currently available for BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. The BRCA Challenge is a model for systematically engaging broad communities and resources for sharing data across genes and eventually regulatory regions of major clinical importance .
 Malaria is a major threat to human health and causes about one million deaths annually. The parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which causes the most dangerous form of malaria, is a rapidly multiplying unicellular organism that requires rapid adaptation to various environments. In order to deal with high fluxes of reactive oxygen species and maintain redox regulatory processes and pathogenicity, Plasmodium depends upon an adequate redox balance. We have obtained the first complete map of redox compartmentation in Plasmodium falciparum by studying the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins. We demonstrate the targeting of two plasmodial peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase system to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. We also obtained a complete picture of the compartmentation of thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-like proteins. Notably, for the two major antioxidant redox-enzymes – glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase – Plasmodium makes use of alternative-translation-initiation ( ATI ) to achieve differential targeting. Dual localization of proteins effected by ATI is likely to occur also in other Apicomplexa and might open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
 Intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) are proteins that do not have a well-defined structure in their unbound state . These proteins play important roles in many biological processes, such as transcriptional and translational regulation, cellular signal transduction, and molecular assembly . IDPs often undergo conformational changes upon binding to their biomacromolecular partners, a process known as coupled folding and binding . Electrostatic interactions are known to play important roles in binding processes, but so far only a limited number of experiments have investigated these interactions within coupled folding and binding reactions. Here, we study the process of coupled folding and binding of PUMA with Mcl-1 using coarse-grained simulations that are specifically designed to include contributions from electrostatic interactions. We find that electrostatic interactions are involved in formation of the initial encounter complex, and that non-native electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in the binding mechanism. Our results highlight the potential importance of electrostatic interactions for describing the binding reactions of IDPs.
 Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain silencing of key developmental genes outside of their expression domains . Recent genome-wide analyses showed a Polycomb ( PC ) distribution with binding to discrete PcG response elements ( PREs ) . Within the cell nucleus , PcG proteins localize in structures called PC bodies that contain PcG-silenced genes . In this study, the authors studied the nuclear distribution of two PcG proteins, PC and Polyhomeotic ( PH ), during Drosophila embryogenesis. They found that PC and PH progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form nuclear structures localized on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis indicates that two types of motion influence the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains containing H2Av-GFP. First, chromatin domains and PC bodies coordinately undergo long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories. Second, each PC body and chromatin domain has its own fast and highly constrained motion within volumes much smaller than chromosome territories, strongly restricting their possibility of interaction with other nuclear structures. The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains observed during early embryogenesis strongly decreases in late developmental stages, indicating a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics in the maintenance of stable gene silencing.
 The study aimed to determine the mutation load in the liver of normally- and prematurely-aging mice using ultra-deep sequencing. The study found that mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing a proof-reading–deficient mtDNA polymerase ( mtDNA mutator mice ) have 10-times-higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. In addition, the mtDNA mutator mice have increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. Sequence analysis shows that the main proportion of the mutation load in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings is inherited from their heterozygous mothers consistent with germline transmission. The study found no increase in levels of point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, thus questioning the causative role of these changes in aging. In addition, there was no increased frequency of transversion mutations with time in any of the studied genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as a major cause of mtDNA mutations. The results from studies of mice indicate that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life.
 The ATP synthase is a protein complex that generates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. It is found in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The ATP synthase consists of two sub-complexes: the water-soluble F1 sector, which harbors the catalytic centers, and the membrane-embedded Fo complex, which mediates ion translocation across the membrane. The Fo complex consists of eight to 15 copies of subunit c, which rotate around their axis as ions permeate across the enzyme. The c-ring harbors a series of identical ion-binding sites, typically one per c-subunit, which selectively recognize the coupling ion. In this study, the authors characterize the structure, ion specificity, and stoichiometry of the c-ring of the ATP synthase from Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative bacterium implicated in the etiology of periodontal diseases. The authors find that the c-ring of F. nucleatum is composed of 12 subunits and that it is Na+-specific. They also find that the c-ring has two carboxyl side-chains, which coordinate Na+ ions. The authors suggest that the second carboxyl group could alter the assumed ion specificity of the c-ring, the ion-to-ATP ratio, or that it confers a novel coupling or regulatory mechanism to the enzyme. The authors' findings provide a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen.
αβ T cell receptor ( TCR ) recognition of foreign peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex ( pMHC ) molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) is a key event in the initiation of adaptive cellular immunity . In vitro , high-affinity binding and/or long-lived interactions between TCRs and pMHC correlate with high-potency T cell activation . However , less is known about the influence of TCR/pMHC interaction parameters on T cell responses in vivo . We studied the influence of TCR/pMHC binding characteristics on in vivo T cell immunity by tracking CD4+ T cell activation , effector , and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of TCR/pMHC half-lives and in vitro T cell activation potencies . Contrary to predictions from in vitro studies , we found that optimal in vivo T cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate TCR/pMHC half-lives . The diminished in vivo responses we observed to the ligand exhibiting the longest TCR/pMHC half-life were associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling , expansion , and function over a broad range of time points . Our results reveal a level of control over T cell activation in vivo not recapitulated in in vitro assays and highlight the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands as part of vaccine design .
 The fungus Nectria haematococca ( asexual name Fusarium solani ) is a member of a group of over 50 species known as the “Fusarium solani species complex” . Members of this complex have diverse biological properties including the ability to cause disease on >100 genera of plants and opportunistic infections in humans . The current research analyzed the most extensively studied member of this complex , N . haematococca mating population VI ( MPVI ) . Several genes controlling the ability of individual isolates of this species to colonize specific habitats are located on supernumerary chromosomes . Optical mapping revealed that the sequenced isolate has 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6 . 52 Mb and that the physical size of the genome , 54 . 43 Mb , and the number of predicted genes , 15 , 707 , are among the largest reported for ascomycetes . Two classes of genes have contributed to gene expansion: specific genes that are not found in other fungi including its closest sequenced relative , Fusarium graminearum; and genes that commonly occur as single copies in other fungi but are present as multiple copies in N . haematococca MPVI . Some of these additional genes appear to have resulted from gene duplication events , while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer . The supernumerary nature of three chromosomes , 14 , 15 , and 17 , was confirmed by their absence in pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments of some isolates and by demonstrating that these isolates lacked chromosome-specific sequences found on the ends of these chromosomes . These supernumerary chromosomes contain more repeat sequences , are enriched in unique and duplicated genes , and have a lower G+C content in comparison to the other chromosomes . Although the origin ( s ) of the extra genes and the supernumerary chromosomes is not known , the gene expansion and its large genome size are consistent with this species' diverse range of habitats . Furthermore , the presence of unique genes on supernumerary chromosomes might account for individual isolates having different environmental niches .
 The study investigates the egress of pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) particles from infected cells. PRV is a neuroanatomical tracing tool and related to human alpha herpesviruses. The study uses live-cell fluorescence microscopy to visualize the final transport and exocytosis of PRV particles in non-polarized epithelial cells. The study finds that PRV particles are transported inside small, acidified secretory vesicles that undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis. The study also identifies key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway that are spatially and dynamically associated with viral exocytosis. Based on these findings, the study proposes an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress.
 The relationship between enterobiasis and chronic inflammatory diseases has been studied, but the results are contradictory. In this study, we recruited 109 primary school children in Taichung, Taiwan, to investigate the association between enterobiasis and gut microbiota and immune responses. We found that childhood exposure to pinworm and mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria including the probiotic Bifidobacterium, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria. The gut SIgA level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, and was increased in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. A higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole deworming treatment. These findings suggest that childhood exposure to pinworm and mebendazole may have protective effects against the development of allergies and autoimmunity.
 We used a genome-wide association (GWA) approach to identify loci contributing to root length variation in a population of wild-collected Arabidopsis thaliana accessions.  We found that the genomic narrow-sense heritability for root length was statistically zero, indicating that the genomic additive genetic variance was negligible.  However, the broad-sense heritability was significantly larger, primarily due to epistasis.  We therefore performed an epistatic GWA analysis to map loci contributing to the epistatic genetic variance.  Four interacting pairs of loci were revealed, involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a standard multiple-testing corrected significance threshold.  The genotype-phenotype maps for these pairs revealed epistasis that cancelled out the additive genetic variance, explaining why these loci were not detected in the additive GWA analysis.  We estimated the false-positive risk using a new statistical approach and suggest that half of the associated pairs are true positive associations.  Our experimental evaluation of candidate genes within the seven associated loci suggests that this estimate is conservative; we identified functional candidate genes that affected root development in four loci that were part of three of the pairs.  Our statistical epistatic analyses were thus indispensable for confirming known and identifying new candidate genes for root length in this population of wild-collected A. thaliana accessions.  We also illustrate how epistatic cancellation of the additive genetic variance explains the insignificant narrow-sense and significant broad-sense heritability by using a combination of careful statistical epistatic analyses and functional genetic experiments.
30,506 mtDNA sequences from around the world were analyzed to determine the characteristics of known pathogenic mtDNA mutations. The mean pathogenicity score for known disease-causing mutations was significantly different between mtDNA macro-haplogroups. Several mutations were observed across all haplogroup backgrounds, while others were only observed on specific clades. Disease-causing mutations were more frequent on young sequences and genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance. These findings suggest that the mtDNA background is implicated in recurrent mutation events that have been purified through natural selection in older populations. This provides an explanation for the low frequency of mtDNA disease reported in specific ethnic groups.
1D collision assays are used to study the interactions between cells and how they coordinate their motion. In these assays, cells are restricted to moving along a micropatterned stripe, increasing the efficiency of the assay. In these assays, four possible outcomes of a collision between two cells have been observed: cells can reverse direction, stick to one another, walk past one another, or chain together. In this study, the authors used a computational phase field model to investigate the chemical and mechanical factors that control these interactions. They found that the balance between internal cell polarization, contact inhibition of locomotion, and cell-cell adhesion governs the collision outcome. The authors identified the parameters that control transitions between the different outcomes and suggest hypotheses for why different cell types have different collision behavior. They also suggest that interventions that modulate collision outcomes could be used to treat cancer.
 The thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complex is a key model for understanding the dissociation mechanism of disulfide bonds. In this study, we used theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants to study the Trx mixed disulfide complex dissociation. We observed that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx. Cys32Trx is activated for its nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds, and Cys32Trx is found to be more reactive than Cys82ArsC. Additionally, Cys32Trx directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx and not on Cys89ArsC. This multidisciplinary approach provides fresh insights into a universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism that results in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx.
 The study examined how people change their preferences based on social information. The authors hypothesized that people can be uncertain about their preferences and that this uncertainty can be reflected in the variability of their choices. The authors found that people's choices became more similar to those of others when they observed others' choices, and that this effect was better accounted for by a Bayesian model that takes into account uncertainty and the relevance of social information. The authors suggest that this finding has important implications for understanding how people learn and make decisions in social contexts.
 In this study, we used a novel screening approach called secretion profiling to identify new aspects of filamentous growth regulation in budding yeast. We found that many of the major filamentation regulatory pathways ( RAS , RIM101 , OPI1 , and RTG ) were required for MAPK activation. Our study indicates that the pathways that control filamentous growth are connected in co-regulatory circuits, bringing to light a systems-level coordination of this differentiation response. This finding provides new insights into the complex regulation of filamentous growth and may have implications for other complex behaviors.
 Fungi are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that play important roles in the environment and in human health. The evolution of fungal morphologies has been hypothesized to be driven by changes in gene expression. To test this hypothesis, researchers compared the gene expression patterns of five filamentous fungi in the Sordariomycetes during five stages of fruiting body development. They identified genes with the largest evolved increases in gene expression across development and knocked out these genes in two divergent species to test their role in fruiting body development. The results showed that changes in gene expression are important for the evolution of fungal morphologies and that knocking out genes with evolved increases in expression can alter fruiting body development. The researchers also used Bayesian networks to identify regulatory modules that are important for fruiting body development and to test the evolution of these modules. Their findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of fungal morphologies and the role of gene expression in this process.
 The schistosome egg represents an attractive developmental stage at which to target transgenes because of its high ratio of germ to somatic cells, its availability from experimentally infected rodents, and its ability to be readily obtained from infected rodents. We investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules including fluorescent (Cy3) short interference (si) RNA molecules, messenger RNAs, and virions into eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. We found that electroporation was more effective for the transduction of eggs with pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus than simply soaking the eggs in virions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.
 In this study, we developed a novel approach called Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission ( PMT ) model to study the dynamic responses of macromolecular assemblies. By monitoring the simultaneous responses of all residues across many decades of time spanning from the initial perturbation until reaching equilibrium using a Krylov subspace projection method, we show that this approach can yield rich information. With criteria based on quantitative measurements of relaxation half-time, flow amplitude change, and oscillation dynamics, this approach can identify pivot residues important for macromolecular movement, messenger residues key to signal mediating, and anchor residues important for binding interactions. Based on a detailed analysis of the GroEL-GroES chaperone system, we found that our predictions have an accuracy of 71–84% judged by independent experimental studies reported in the literature. This approach is general and can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries such as the virus capsid and ribosomal complex.
 The physiological role of fungal galectins has remained elusive. In this study, we found that feeding of a mushroom galectin, Coprinopsis cinerea CGL2, to Caenorhabditis elegans inhibited development and reproduction and ultimately resulted in killing of this nematode. The lack of toxicity of a carbohydrate-binding defective CGL2 variant and the resistance of a C . elegans mutant defective in GDP-fucose biosynthesis suggested that CGL2-mediated nematotoxicity depends on the interaction between the galectin and a fucose-containing glycoconjugate. A screen for CGL2-resistant worm mutants identified this glycoconjugate as a Galβ1 , 4Fucα1 , 6 modification of C . elegans N-glycan cores. Analysis of N-glycan structures in wild type and CGL2-resistant nematodes confirmed this finding and allowed the identification of a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of this glycoepitope. The X-ray crystal structure of a complex between CGL2 and the Galβ1 , 4Fucα1 , 6GlcNAc trisaccharide at 1 . 5 Å resolution revealed the biophysical basis for this interaction. Our results suggest that fungal galectins play a role in the defense of fungi against predators by binding to specific glycoconjugates of these organisms.
 HIV is a virus that causes AIDS and is known to have a long-lived reservoir of infected cells in the body. This reservoir is thought to have an important role in the evolution of the virus, but this has not been well studied. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical model that incorporates the reservoir and used it to study the evolution of HIV. They found that the presence of the reservoir can delay the evolution of the virus within a single host, and this delay can have important effects on the evolution of the virus at the population level. The authors suggest that the reservoir may play a more important role in the evolution of HIV than previously thought.
 In this study, we used transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as sensors to evaluate in vitro and in vivo antigen presentation by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and found that CVB3 almost completely inhibits antigen presentation via the MHC class I pathway, thereby evading CD8+ T cell immunity. In contrast, the presentation of CVB3-encoded MHC class II epitopes is relatively unencumbered, and CVB3 induces in vivo CD4+ T cell responses that are, by several criteria, phenotypically normal. The cells display an effector phenotype and mature into multi-functional CVB3-specific memory CD4+ T cells that expand dramatically following challenge infection and rapidly differentiate into secondary effector cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines. Our findings have implications for the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during coxsackievirus infection.
 Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection that affects the skin and peripheral nerves. Type 1 reactions (T1Rs) are a major cause of nerve damage and disability in leprosy patients. T1Rs are treated with oral corticosteroids, but there is limited information on the optimal dose and duration of treatment. This study investigated the efficacy of three days of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone at the start of prednisolone therapy in leprosy T1Rs and nerve function impairment. Forty-two individuals were randomized to receive methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone or oral prednisolone alone. There were no significant differences in adverse events or clinical improvement at the completion of the study. However, individuals treated with methylprednisolone were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study. The study also demonstrated that 50% of individuals with T1Rs and/or nerve function impairment required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids. The study lends further support to the use of more prolonged courses of corticosteroid to treat T1Rs and the investigation of risk factors for the recurrence of T1Rs and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment.
 The immune system is responsible for protecting the body from pathogens and diseases. However, in some cases, the immune system can become overactive and cause inflammation, leading to tissue damage and disease. One way to regulate the immune system is through the use of regulatory T cells ( Treg ). Treg are a type of immune cell that help to suppress the immune response and prevent inflammation. In this study, the authors investigated the effects of Treg on CD8+ T cells, which are important for the immune response against viruses. They found that Treg from HIV-infected patients did not effectively suppress the function of CD8+ T cells, suggesting that Treg may not be able to effectively regulate the immune response in HIV-infected individuals. The authors also found that Treg from HIV-infected patients had higher levels of the protein PD-1, which is involved in regulating the immune response. These findings suggest that Treg may not be able to effectively regulate the immune response in HIV-infected individuals due to changes in their function and protein expression.
 Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne infection caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or Brugia timori that affects 120 million people in 73 countries and another 1100 million people are at risk [1, 2]. The parasite survives within the lymphatic vessels for years despite the complex immune environment surrounding it. Parasites possibly accomplish this by adopting various immunomodulatory strategies, including releasing glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) that counteract the oxidative free radicals produced by the host. Several studies have evaluated the potential of GSTs as vaccine candidates, especially against schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, and Seteria cervi. However, vaccine potential of GSTs of lymphatic filarial parasites has not been evaluated before. In the present study, the GST gene was cloned from the third stage larval (L3) cDNA libraries of Wuchereria bancrofti, and recombinant GST (rWbGST) was expressed and purified. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed for their reactivity with rWbGST. These findings showed that sera from endemic normal individuals (EN) carry significant levels of anti-WbGST IgG antibodies compared to subjects who are microfilaraemic (Mf) or show symptoms of clinical pathology (CP). Isotype analysis of the anti-WbGST IgG antibodies showed a predominance of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies in EN individuals. Subsequent functional analysis of the rWbGST showed that the rWbGST protein retained the enzymatic activity of GST and the antibodies in EN sera could inhibit this enzymatic activity. Similar results were obtained when anti-rWbGST antibodies raised in mice were used in the neutralization assay. Brugia malayi GST and WbGST show significant sequence similarity. Therefore, to evaluate the vaccine potential of rWbGST, we used B. malayi L3 as challenge parasites. Vaccine potential of rWbGST was initially evaluated by confirming the role of human and mice WbGST antibodies in an antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. Subsequent vaccination studies in a jird model showed that approximately 61% protection could be achieved against a B. malayi L3 challenge infection in jirds immunized with rWbGST. Results of this study show that rWbGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. Nearly 61% protection can be achieved against a B. malayi challenge infection in a jird model. The study also showed that the WbGST protein retained the enzymatic activity of GST and this enzymatic activity appears to be critical for the survival of the parasite in the host.
 CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful tool for genome editing, but concerns remain about the potential for off-target effects. Recent studies have used whole-genome sequencing to search for de novo mutations (DNMs) in gene-edited embryos or animals, but these studies used strain-matched, not pedigree-matched controls. This means that generational or colony-related differences were not reliably distinguished from true DNMs. In this study, we used a trio design and whole-genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, where 10 of the embryos were mutagenized with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the coat color Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. Detailed analyses of these whole-genome data allowed us to conclude that if CRISPR mutagenesis were causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos, then the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes.
 Stomata are pores on the surface of plant leaves that regulate the exchange of gases between the plant and its environment. The opening and closing of stomata are controlled by various environmental signals, including light. Blue light is one of the environmental signals that regulate stomatal opening. The perception of blue light is mediated by the blue/UV-A light-absorbing cryptochromes and phototropins. In this study, two new players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), were identified and their genetic and biochemical interactions in the control of stomatal aperture were reported. Mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 lead to the misregulation of the stomatal aperture and reduce water loss under blue light. Both HRB1 and PP7 are expressed in the guard cells in response to a light-to-dark or dark-to-light transition. HRB1 interacts with PP7 through its N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif and requires a functional PP7 for its stomatal opening response. HRB1 is phosphorylated in vivo, and PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1. HRB1 is mostly dephosphorylated in a protein complex of 193 kDa in the dark, and blue light increases complex size to 285 kDa. In the pp7 mutant, this size shift is impaired, and HRB1 is predominately phosphorylated. The authors propose that a modification of HRB1 by PP7 under blue light is essential to acquire a proper conformation or to bring in new components for the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex. Guard cells control stomatal opening in response to multiple environmental or biotic stimuli. This study may furnish strategies that allow plants to enjoy the advantages of both constitutive and ABA-induced protection under water-limiting conditions.
 The Mediator is a conserved multi-protein complex that plays a critical role in RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression. In C . elegans , the Mediator subunit MDT-15 is required for the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, detoxification, and stress responses. In this study, we found that MDT-15 is also required for the expression of genes involved in the regulation of metabolism, development, and aging. We propose a model in which MDT-15 integrates multiple transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotic compounds. Our findings suggest that MDT-15 is a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases.
 The hippocampus is responsible for spatial navigation and memory. Place cells in the hippocampus fire in specific locations in space, creating a map of the environment. However, the exact nature of this map is not fully understood. In this study, we propose a new hypothesis that the hippocampal map is a topological map based on the connectivity and adjacency of place fields. We use computer simulations to test this hypothesis and find that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. We also identify a “learning region” that highlights the interplay between different parameters in forming a hippocampal map. Our findings suggest that the hippocampal map is a topological map that is based on connectivity and adjacency, and that this map is formed through a learning process that involves the interplay of different parameters.
 Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) is a highly infectious virus that causes chronic liver disease in humans. The current model of HCV production involves the assembly of virions on or near the surface of lipid droplets, envelopment at the ER in association with components of VLDL synthesis, and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements for and a mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete. In this study, we combined an RNA interference ( RNAi ) analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion with the development of live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress. RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network ( TGN ) , VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. Our results support a model wherein HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. We next constructed infectious HCV with a tetracysteine ( TC ) tag insertion in core ( TC-core ) to monitor the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors. In order to isolate core protein movements associated with infectious HCV secretion, only trafficking events that required the essential HCV assembly factor NS2 were quantified. TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and this movement can be inhibited by nocodazole. Sub-populations of TC-core localize to the Golgi and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome. Silencing of the recycling endosome component Rab11a results in the accumulation of HCV core at the Golgi. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) and VAMP1 vesicles. This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress, while presenting dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells.
 The study investigates the role of an imprinted gene, Grb10, in tumorigenesis. Grb10 is expressed from only one parental allele and its loss can occur during tumorigenesis. The study used mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) to investigate the role of Grb10 in tumorigenesis. The study found that Grb10 loss can occur during tumorigenesis and can promote hyperproliferation, a feature of tumor development. The study also found that restoring Grb10 in NF1 null tumors can suppress tumor growth in a Ras-dependent mechanism. The study suggests that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin.
Pavlovian threat conditioning is a fundamental skill in changing environments that involves learning to predict aversive events from environmental cues. Despite a plethora of studies on the neural mechanisms supporting this process, our computational understanding of it is fragmented. Here, we investigate human autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlovian fear conditioning using a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling. We find that a probabilistic learning model best explains ANS responses, and that skin conductance and pupil size responses reflect different quantities of the same model. These findings could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning.
 We have identified a negative regulator of septation and conidiation in the filamentous fungus A. nidulans, PomA, which is a suppressor of SepH, a key player in the septum initiation network (SIN). PomA and SepH indirectly regulate the phosphorylation of HogA, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) involved in osmotic stress response. We found that PomA and SepH are required for early events during cytokinesis but not for the last step in the SIN cascade. Our results suggest that crosstalk exists between the SIN and MAPK pathways.
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites and transmitted by sandflies. It is endemic in many parts of the world, including Brazil, where it causes significant morbidity and mortality. The disease can manifest as cutaneous, mucosal, or diffuse forms, and the factors that determine the severity of the disease are not fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) in Leishmania parasites may be associated with the development of mucosal leishmaniasis. In this study, we investigated the presence of LRV1 in Leishmania parasites isolated from patients with cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in Rondonia, Brazil. We found that LRV1 was present in Leishmania parasites isolated from patients with both cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis, and that the frequency of LRV1 was higher in parasites isolated from patients with mucosal leishmaniasis. Our findings suggest that the presence of LRV1 in Leishmania parasites may be associated with the development of mucosal leishmaniasis.
 The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Type I interferon (IFN-I) is known to play a role in antiviral and intracellular bacterial immunity, but its functional significance during pneumococcal infection is not well defined. Here, we show that IFN-I plays an important role in host defense against pneumococci by counteracting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to the blood. Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) or mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against the type I interferon receptor exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection, while maintaining comparable bacterial numbers in the lung. In turn, treatment of mice with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly (I:C)) dramatically reduced the development of bacteremia following intranasal infection with S. pneumoniae. IFNβ treatment led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of the pneumococcal uptake receptor, platelet activating factor receptor (PAF receptor). In accordance with these findings, Ifnar1−/− mice showed overall enhanced lung permeability. As such, our data identify IFN-I as an important component of the host immune defense that regulates two possible mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion, i.e., PAF receptor-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration, ultimately limiting progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease.
 Neural networks with a single plastic layer can learn simple foraging tasks, but advanced pattern discrimination and continuous learning in a network of spiking neurons with multiple plastic layers is demonstrated in this study. The network utilized both reward modulated and non-reward modulated spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) and implemented multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization of rewarded STDP, and hard limits on synaptic strength. The study predicts a critical set of properties of the spiking neuronal network with STDP that was sufficient to solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision making.
 The ETS transcription factor ELF5 is a key regulator of mammary gland development and function. In breast cancer, ELF5 is a key transcriptional determinant of tumor subtype and has been implicated in the development of antiestrogen resistance. In the MMTV-PyMT mouse model of luminal breast cancer, increased ELF5 levels drive metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. Depletion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) using specific Ly6G antibodies prevented ELF5 from driving vasculogenesis and metastasis. Expression signatures in luminal A breast cancers indicated that increased myeloid cell invasion and inflammation were correlated with ELF5 expression, and increased ELF5 immunohistochemical staining predicted much shorter metastasis–free and overall survival of luminal A patients. Thus, in the MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary model, increased ELF5 levels drive metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. As ELF5 has been previously implicated in the development of antiestrogen resistance, this finding implicates ELF5 as a defining factor in the acquisition of the key aspects of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer.
 In this study, we developed a mechanistic model that maps three fundamental patterns for two interacting DNA loops into a 4–state model of stochastic transcription. We found that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise whereas alternating loops have just opposite effects. We also compared effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression. We found that the former performs better than the latter in controlling mean expression and in tuning expression noise, but this control or tuning is distance–dependent, remarkable for moderate loop lengths, and there is a limit loop length such that the difference in effect between two communication forms almost disappears. Our analysis and results justify the facilitated chromatin–looping hypothesis.
 The authors present a novel approach to design and develop pure riboregulators that repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. These riboregulators, referred to as translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), are designed de novo and do not require coexpressed proteins. The authors use a combination of in silico and in vivo approaches to identify and optimize the features of tiRNAs. They find that six features are important for efficient gene repression by pure riboregulators, including the formation of paired termini structures, the formation of a stem-loop structure, and the presence of a bulge. The authors also develop a partial least squares (PLS) model that links the features of tiRNAs to gene repression. This model allows for the prediction of the repression efficiency of new tiRNAs based on their sequence and structure. Overall, the authors' approach provides a framework for the design of efficient pure riboregulators that can be used for metabolic engineering and other applications.
 The brain is made up of billions of neurons that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. These signals can be measured using electroencephalography ( EEG ) and local field potentials ( LFPs ). LFPs are a measure of the electrical activity of a group of neurons in a specific area of the brain. In this study, the authors recorded LFPs from multiple sites in the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex. They found that when the activity of a local neuronal group exceeded a certain threshold, its activity pattern occurred without distortion at other cortex sites via fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, which the authors called coherence potentials, extended up to hundreds of milliseconds and marked periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information much like action potentials at the single-cell level. However, coherence potentials also had an additional degree of freedom in the diversity of their waveforms, which provided a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and allowed identification of particular associations. These results suggest that the brain may use a "tipping point" in its network dynamics to encode and identify particular associations, similar to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.
 Nuclear size correlates with cell size, but the mechanism by which this scaling is achieved is not known. We screened fission yeast gene deletion mutants to identify essential factors involved in this process. Our screen has identified 25 essential factors that alter nuclear size, and our analysis has implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in nuclear size control. This study has revealed lower and more extreme higher nuclear size phenotypes and has identified global cellular processes and specific structural nuclear components important for nuclear size control.
 Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) is a widely used treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor. However, the underlying mechanisms of how DBS works are still unclear. In this study, we used a mathematical model called the Kuramoto model to understand how DBS affects the brain. The Kuramoto model is a simplified representation of the brain as a network of neurons that oscillate in phase. We found that the best time to apply DBS is when the brain oscillations are at their lowest amplitude. This is because when the brain oscillations are at their lowest amplitude, they are more easily disrupted by the DBS. We also found that the best phase at which to apply DBS is when the brain oscillations are at their highest phase. This is because when the brain oscillations are at their highest phase, they are most easily disrupted by the DBS. These findings have important implications for the design of future DBS treatments.
 Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem worldwide, with over 230 million people affected. The freshwater pulmonate snails of the genus Biomphalaria are the intermediate hosts of the parasite. The development of new molecular monitoring assays for large-scale screening of snails from transmission sites to detect the presence of schistosomes is an important point to consider for snail control interventions related to schistosomiasis elimination. Our work was focused on developing and evaluating a new LAMP assay combined with a simple DNA extraction method to detect S . mansoni in experimentally infected snails as a diagnostic tool for field conditions. The assay could be potentially useful for large-scale screening in searching infected snails with S . mansoni in field applicable conditions.
Dengue is a major public health problem affecting more than half of the world’s population living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In Sri Lanka, dengue is considered to be hyperendemic with all four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus in circulation for more than 30 years. The Ministry of Health is responsible for controlling dengue and other disease outbreaks and associated health care. The involvement of large numbers of public health staff in year-around dengue control activities and the provision of free medical care to dengue patients at public hospitals place a formidable financial burden on the public health sector. We estimated the public sector costs of dengue control activities and the direct costs of hospitalizations in Colombo district during the epidemic year of 2012 from the Ministry of Health’s perspective. The total cost of dengue control and reported hospitalizations was estimated at US$3.45 million (US$1.50 per capita) in Colombo district in 2012. Personnel costs accounted for the largest shares of the total costs of dengue control activities (79%) and hospitalizations (46%). The results indicated a per capita cost of US$0.42 for dengue control activities. The average costs per hospitalization ranged between US$216–609 for pediatric cases and between US$196–866 for adult cases according to disease severity and treatment setting. This analysis is a first attempt to assess the economic burden of dengue response in the public health sector in Sri Lanka. Our results suggest that dengue poses a major economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka.
40,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa and into Europe. The genetic makeup of modern Europeans has been the subject of intense debate, with some arguing that the majority of genetic diversity in Europe comes from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, while others argue that it comes from Neolithic farmers from the Near East. In this study, the authors analyzed the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity within the most common European Y-chromosomal lineage, haplogroup R1b1b2, and found that it is best explained by spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic. This indicates that the majority of European Y chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion. The authors argue that this reinterpretation makes Europe a prime example of how technological and cultural change is linked with the expansion of a Y-chromosomal lineage. The contrast of this pattern with that shown by maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA suggests a unique role for males in the transition.
 We have found that motor variability can have a broad range of effects on motor learning, both positive and negative. We have also found that across a wide range of experiments, motor variability has no statistical relation with learning rate. Our findings suggest that motor variability is task-specific and depends on which factor predominantly affects task performance. We have designed a series of experiments to test this hypothesis and found that adaptation rate was correlated to variability in completely different ways across tasks. We have also presented a new meta-analysis to show a lack of relation between variability and learning rate across a broad range of previously published data. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific task and the factors that affect it when studying the relationship between motor variability and learning rate.
 NF-κB is a transcription factor that plays a vital role in the immune response and inflammation. To activate transcription, NF-κB interacts with CBP/p300, a general transcriptional co-activator. The interaction between NF-κB and CBP/p300 is bipartite, with the DNA binding domain of NF-κB interacting with the KIX domain of CBP/p300 and the transcriptional activation domain of NF-κB interacting with the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. The role of the latter interaction in the transcription of NF-κB-activated genes is unclear. Here, we provide the solution structure of the latter component of the NF-κB:CBP complex by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals the folding of RelA–TA2 upon binding to TAZ1 through its well-conserved hydrophobic sites in a series of grooves on the TAZ1 surface. The structural analysis coupled with the mechanistic studies by mutational and isothermal calorimetric analyses allowed the design of RelA-mutants that selectively abrogated the two distinct components of the NF-κB:CBP/p300 interaction. Detailed studies of these RelA mutants using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that a major set of the NF-κB-activated genes, larger than previously believed, is affected by this interaction. We further show how the NF-κB:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through the negative feedback loop of NF-κB pathway. Additionally, chromatin analyses of RelA target gene promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300, thus indicating a possible role of CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites.
 The paper introduces a new method for analyzing longitudinal gene expression data, called Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA). TcGSA is a hypothesis-driven method that uses linear mixed effects models to test for significant changes in gene expression over time within predefined gene sets. The method accounts for missing data and heterogeneity within gene sets, and has been shown to be more powerful than other methods for analyzing time-course gene expression data. The paper provides an example of how TcGSA can be used to analyze longitudinal data from a HIV vaccine trial and an influenza and pneumococcal vaccine study. TcGSA identified additional gene sets that were not found by other methods, and revealed common pathways across the three vaccines. The paper concludes that TcGSA is a useful tool for analyzing longitudinal gene expression data and can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying vaccine responses.
 Plasmodium vivax is a major human malaria parasite that is often neglected in research and control efforts. Here, we present the first systematic effort to map the global endemicity of P. vivax. We updated our earlier estimate of the geographical limits of P. vivax transmission and used a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach to estimate endemicity within every 5×5 km resolution grid square. Our results show that P. vivax endemicity is relatively low and sparsely populated in most areas of the world. We hope that this detailed depiction of geographically varying risk will contribute to a much-needed paradigm shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination.
 Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections ( SSTIs ) and is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. The cell wall-anchored protein clumping factor B ( ClfB ) has been shown to facilitate S . aureus nasal colonization through high affinity interactions with the cornified envelope in the anterior nares. However, the role of ClfB during SSTIs has never been investigated. This study reveals a novel role for ClfB during SSTIs. ClfB is crucial in determining the abscess structure and bacterial burden early in infection and this is dependent upon a specific interaction with the ligand loricrin which is expressed within the abscess tissue. Targeting ClfB using a model vaccine that induced both protective humoral and cellular responses, leads to protection during S . aureus skin infection. This study therefore identifies ClfB as an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines.
 HIV is a major public health challenge that continues to affect millions of people worldwide. To prevent HIV transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set a goal of reducing new HIV infections to 500,000 by 2020. One of the strategies to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves taking antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV infection. Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is the only medication approved for PrEP. However, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to a once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, next-generation regimens are being investigated. However, pre-clinical testing may not translate into clinical efficacy, and long and large clinical trials are expensive and ethically problematic. To prioritize and design PrEP regimens, tools are needed that integrate pharmacological, viral, and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. In this study, we developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). We combined the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework to predict that plasma concentrations of 145.18 nM and 722.23 nM prevent 50% and 90% sexual transmissions, respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP "on demand," and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure. Once daily PrEP with 50 mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP "on demand" prevented 79-84% infections, and PEP >80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. Our simulations indicated that oral 50 mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. Moreover, the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations. Our integrative framework can be adapted to other PrEP candidates and guide the design of PrEP regimens.
 Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) induces autophagy to enhance its replication . However, how HCV regulates the autophagic pathway remains largely unclear. In this report, we demonstrated that HCV infection could induce the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which inhibited and stimulated the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. The induction of Rubicon by HCV was prompt whereas the induction of UVRAG was delayed, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes in the early time points of viral infection. The role of Rubicon in inhibiting the maturation of autophagosomes in HCV-infected cells was confirmed by siRNA knockdown and the over-expression of Rubicon, which enhanced and suppressed the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. Rubicon played a positive role in HCV replication, as the suppression of its expression reduced HCV replication and its over-expression enhanced HCV replication. In contrast, the over-expression of UVRAG facilitated the maturation of autophagosomes and suppressed HCV replication. The HCV subgenomic RNA replicon, which expressed only the nonstructural proteins, could also induce the expression of Rubicon and the accumulation of autophagosomes. Further analysis indicated that the HCV NS4B protein was sufficient to induce Rubicon and autophagosomes. Our results thus indicated that HCV, by differentially inducing the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, temporally regulated the autophagic flux to enhance its replication.
 Cyclin Y-like 1 ( Ccnyl1 ) is a newly-identified member of the cyclin family that is highly similar in protein sequences to Cyclin Y ( Ccny ) . However , the function of Ccnyl1 is poorly characterized in any organism . In this study , we found that Ccnyl1 was most abundantly expressed in the testis of mice and was about seven times higher than the level of Ccny . Male Ccnyl1-/- mice were infertile , whereas both male and female Ccny-/- mice displayed normal fertility . These results suggest that Ccnyl1 , but not Ccny , is indispensable for male fertility . We found that the protein , but not the mRNA , level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 ( CDK16 ) was decreased in the testis of Ccnyl1-/- mice . Further study demonstrated that CCNYL1 interacted with CDK16 and this interaction mutually increased the stability of these two proteins . Moreover , the interaction increased the kinase activity of CDK16 . In addition , we observed an alteration of phosphorylation levels of CDK16 in the presence of CCNYL1 . We identified the phosphorylation sites of CDK16 by mass spectrometry and revealed that several phosphorylation modifications on the N-terminal region of CDK16 were indispensable for the CCNYL1 binding and the modulation of CDK16 kinase activity . Our results therefore reveal a previously unrecognized role of CCNYL1 in regulating spermatogenesis through the interaction and modulation of CDK16 .
 Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a major cause of diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. EHEC hemolysin (EHEC-Hly) is a virulence factor that causes hemolysis of human red blood cells. We found that EHEC-Hly is also associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by EHEC during growth. The OMV-associated EHEC-Hly is more stable than the free form and can bind to human microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2). We found that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly is internalized by HBMEC and Caco-2 cells via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs. The toxin is then separated from OMVs in endosomes and targets mitochondria, leading to apoptosis via the intrinsic caspase-9-dependent pathway. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases.
 Transcription is a complex process that involves many different proteins and modifications to the DNA and histones. One of the key modifications to histones is mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1), which plays a role in coordinating co-transcriptional histone modification. In this study, the authors reveal a novel function of H2Bub1 in regulating elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). They found that H2Bub1 regulates gene expression through an unidentified, methylation-independent mechanism. The authors also found that H2Bub1 is required for normal cell growth and morphology, and for elongation by RNAPII at select target genes. They discovered that H2Bub1 is regulated by a conserved subset of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) associated with the transcription machinery. The authors propose a new regulatory paradigm whereby regulatory proteins in the cell are controlled predominantly by the specific regulation they conduct.
 Yellow fever virus ( YFV ) is a mosquito-borne disease that causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans. To determine the evolutionary history of YFV, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the largest YFV data set compiled to date, representing the prM/E gene region from 133 viral isolates sampled from 22 countries over a period of 76 years. We estimate that the currently circulating strains of YFV arose in Africa within the last 1,500 years and emerged in the Americas following the slave trade approximately 300–400 years ago. These viruses then spread westwards across the continent and persist there to this day in the jungles of South America. We therefore illustrate how gene sequence data can be used to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and document the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease.
 Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a leading cause of disease in humans, including otitis media, pneumonia, and sepsis. The pneumococcus is a commensal organism that colonizes the nasopharynx of humans, and it is transmitted from person to person through respiratory secretions. In this study, we used an infant mouse model of pneumococcal colonization, disease, and transmission to identify potential bottlenecks in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease. We found that in the setting of influenza A (IAV) co-infection, the pneumococcus must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. These observations demonstrate how viral infection and TLR-dependent innate immune responses stimulated by viral infection drive bacterial contagion.
 In this study, we aimed to identify recombinant proteins derived from P . orientalis salivary gland secretions that could be used as markers of exposure to sand fly bites in humans. We produced five recombinant proteins using bacterial expression systems and four using mammalian expression systems. We then tested these proteins as antigens in human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, two countries endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. We found that two proteins, mAG5 and mYEL1, were the most promising antigens, showing high correlation coefficients and good specificity in comparison to whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. Combining these two proteins led to an even further increase in the capability to detect anti-P . orientalis antibody responses. This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P . orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. Our findings suggest that these two proteins could be used as markers of exposure to P . orientalis bites in humans from endemic areas of Eastern Africa.
 The study investigates the role of the tra genes of Salmonella genomic island 1 ( SGI1 ) in the transfer of SGI1 and IncC plasmids. SGI1 is a mobile genetic element that carries genes conferring antibiotic resistance and is frequently found in clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica. The study shows that the tra genes of SGI1 are under the control of the master activator AcaCD and are important for the transfer of SGI1. The study also shows that substitution of the TraG subunit enables SGI1 to escape an entry exclusion mechanism encoded by IncC plasmids, thereby enhancing its transfer. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the transfer of SGI1 and IncC plasmids and may have implications for the development of strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.
 DNA damage is a common occurrence in cells, and the DNA damage checkpoint is a mechanism that helps cells repair the damage before it becomes too severe. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 plays a role in this checkpoint, and overexpression of Cdc5 has been shown to promote faster adaptation to DNA damage. In this study, the authors overexpressed Cdc5 from the GAL1 promoter and examined key steps in checkpoint activation individually. They found that Cdc5 overproduction had little effect on the early steps leading to Rad53 activation, but significantly reduced Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, which is required for cell-cycle arrest. The authors conclude that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation to allow cells to adapt to DNA damage. This study provides important insights into the role of Cdc5 in the DNA damage checkpoint and its function in promoting adaptation to DNA damage.
 The brain is a complex network of neurons and neuroglia that communicate through the exchange of ions across their plasma membranes. The extracellular space ( ECS ) is filled with a salt solution that plays a crucial role in the electrodiffusion of ions. The dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential in the ECS are governed by the Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck ( KNP ) framework, which is tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. In this work, we present the 3-D KNP framework and demonstrate its efficiency by simulating the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has proposed a budget cut for its vector-borne diseases program, which could have a significant impact on mosquito surveillance and research. To demonstrate the consequences of such a measure, we used a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in an economically developed urban environment. Our study shows that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. Our findings provide a science-based justification for the re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program and emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance.
 Dengue is a rapidly spreading infectious disease that affects millions of people worldwide. In Nicaragua, dengue has been well documented in urban areas, but less is known about its prevalence in rural areas. To study dengue in rural western Nicaragua, we obtained epidemiologic and clinical data as well as acute and convalescent sera from a convenience sample of consecutively enrolled patients aged ≥ 1 year presenting with acute febrile illness. We found that dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in rural western Nicaragua. Since Zika virus is transmitted by the same vector and has been associated with severe congenital infections, the population we studied is at particular risk for being devastated by the Zika epidemic that has now reached Central America.
 Plant-parasitic nematodes are a major threat to global food security, causing billions of dollars in crop losses annually. In this study, we show that nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitor/s can induce PTI in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. We identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, termed NILR1, that is specifically regulated upon infection by nematodes. NILR1 is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes and nilr1 loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes. To our knowledge, NILR1 is the first example of an immune receptor that is involved in induction of basal immunity (PTI) in plants or in animals in response to nematodes. Manipulation of NILR1 will provide new options for nematode control in crop plants in future.
 The current study examined the effect of treating Schistosoma mansoni adult worms with miltefosine on exposure of worm surface antigens in vitro. In an indirect immunofluorescence assay, rabbit anti-S. mansoni adult worm homogenate and anti-S. mansoni infection antisera gave strong immunofluorescence of the S. mansoni adult worm surface after treatment with miltefosine. Rabbit antibodies that recognized surface antigens exposed on miltefosine-treated worms were recovered by elution off the worm surface in low pH buffer and were used in a western immunoblotting assay to identify antigenic targets in a homogenate extract of adult worms (SmWH). Four proteins reacting with the antibodies in immunoblots were purified and proteomic analysis (MS/MS) combined with specific immunoblotting indicated they were the S. mansoni proteins: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (SmFBPA), Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These antibodies were also found to bind to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induce immune agglutination of the parasites, suggesting they may have a role in immune protection. This study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent. The immune-dependent hypothesis we investigated has previously been lent credence with praziquantel (PZQ), whereby treatment unmasks parasite surface antigens not normally exposed to the host during infection. Antigens involved in this molecular mechanism could have potential as intervention targets and antibodies against these antigens may act to increase the drug’s anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection.
 In host-pathogen interactions, the struggle for iron may have major consequences on the outcome of the disease. To overcome the low solubility and bio-availability of iron, bacteria have evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources such as heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. The molecular basis of iron acquisition from heme and hemoglobin has been extensively studied; however, very little is known about iron acquisition from host ferritin, a 24-mer nanocage protein that stores thousands of iron atoms within its cavity. In the human opportunistic pathogen Bacillus cereus, a surface protein named IlsA binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. Here, we demonstrate that IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. Isothermal titration calorimetry data indicate that IlsA binds several types of ferritins through direct interaction with the shell subunits. UV-vis kinetic data show a significant enhancement of iron release from ferritin in the presence of IlsA indicating for the first time that a bacterial protein might alter the stability of the ferritin iron core. Disruption of the siderophore bacillibactin production drastically reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth and results in attenuated bacterial virulence in insects. We propose a new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus that involves the binding of IlsA to host ferritin followed by siderophore assisted iron uptake. Our results highlight a possible interplay between a surface protein and a siderophore and provide new insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and general bacterial pathogenesis.
The circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two phosphorylation sites per monomer, serine 431 and threonine 432. The phosphorylation cycle proceeds via the transfer of phosphate groups between the threonine/serine residues and the nucleotide bound to CII. ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, while phosphorylation in the CII domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model predicts that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain is the place where detailed balance must be broken in order to generate sustained oscillations. The model also explains the characteristic sequence in which the threonine and serine sites are phosphorylated, the sequestration of KaiA, and the delay between the moment that a given KaiC hexamer reaches its point of maximum phosphorylation and the moment that the same KaiC actually sequesters KaiA. The model can also explain the robustness of the oscillation period to variations in steady-state ATP/ADP levels and the entrainment of the clock by transient changes in this ratio.
 Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is a DNA virus that suppresses innate immune signaling to establish persistent infection. Although HBV is a DNA virus, its pre-genomic RNA ( pgRNA ) can be sensed by RIG-I and activates MAVS to mediate interferon ( IFN ) λ synthesis. Despite the activation of RIG-I-MAVS axis by pgRNA, the underlying mechanism explaining how HBV infection fails to induce interferon-αβ ( IFN ) synthesis remained uncharacterized. We demonstrate that HBV induced parkin is able to recruit the linear ubiquitin assembly complex ( LUBAC ) to mitochondria and abrogates IFN β synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, accumulates unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS via LUBAC, to disrupt MAVS signalosome and attenuate IRF3 activation. This study highlights the novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling which involves LUBAC being recruited to the mitochondria. These results provide avenues of investigations on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity.
 The human immune system is designed to recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses. However, sometimes the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells, leading to autoimmune diseases. One such disease is Crohn's disease, which affects the digestive system. Researchers have identified a protein called I2 that is associated with Crohn's disease and may play a role in its development. In this study, the researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of I2 and found that it belongs to a family of proteins called TetR. They also found that I2 can bind to a protein called HLA-DR, which is important for the immune system to recognize and attack foreign invaders. The researchers believe that I2 may be a superantigen, which is a type of protein that can stimulate the immune system to attack many different types of cells. This could explain why I2 is associated with Crohn's disease. The researchers hope that their findings will help to better understand the development of Crohn's disease and lead to new treatments for the disease.
 Nanog is a key pluripotency regulator that exhibits a disperse distribution within stem cell populations. Recent studies have shown that this heterogeneity is due to allelic control of Nanog expression, whereby each cell expresses either one or both alleles of the gene. We have developed a multiscale stochastic population balance equation framework to investigate the effects of allelic control on Nanog expression and stem cell population heterogeneity. Our results show that allelic control is sufficient to generate a multimodal distribution of Nanog in stem cell populations, even in the absence of transcriptional noise. We also demonstrate how the use of reporter cell lines carrying a single allelic knock-in of Nanog can lead to misinterpretation of the data. Finally, we show that Nanog+/− mutant ESCs maintain a group of self-renewing cells through allelic control, despite their higher propensity for differentiation and lower average content of NANOG protein. Our findings highlight the importance of considering allelic control in models of stem cell population heterogeneity and provide a framework for the analysis of reporter cell lines.
 The costs and benefits of protein expression are balanced through evolution . Expression of un-utilized protein ( that have no benefits in the current environment ) incurs a quantifiable fitness costs on cellular growth rates; however , the magnitude and variability of un-utilized protein expression in natural settings is unknown , largely due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome utilization . We address this challenge using absolute and global proteomics data combined with a recently developed genome-scale model of Escherichia coli that computes the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis . We show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains >95% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across 16 distinct environments . Furthermore , reduction in unused protein expression is shown to be a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments . Classification of the unused protein reveals that the unused protein encodes several nutrient- and stress- preparedness functions , which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments . Thus , unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change .
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) is a major chronic disease worldwide , affecting more than 300 million people . The greatest increase in the prevalence of T2D in the coming years is likely to be in Asia , home to half of the world's population with 3 billion people [1]–[2] . In Singapore , a multi-ethnic demography consisting mainly of Chinese , Malays and Asian Indians , there is vast potential for investigating the genetic etiology of T2D . We performed genome-wide association scans for T2D in 3 , 955 Chinese ( 2 , 010 cases , 1 , 945 controls ) , 2 , 034 Malays ( 794 cases , 1 , 240 controls ) , and 2 , 146 Asian Indians ( 977 cases , 1 , 169 controls ) . We identified 11 novel loci associated with T2D in these ethnic groups, and confirmed the associations at 10 previously identified loci. Our findings highlight the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups towards the fine-mapping efforts for the causal variants and also of the search for variants , which may be population-specific . , Introduction:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) is a major chronic disease worldwide , affecting more than 300 million people .

The replication results were consistent with the original associations in the Chinese population, but not in the other ethnic groups. This may be due to the limited sample size in the other ethnic groups, or the differences in the genetic background or environmental exposures between the populations. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings. , Keyword: ['diabetes and endocrinology/type 2 diabetes', 'genetics and genomics/medical genetics', 'genetics and genomics/population genetics']
 The nuclear division in the budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is different from that of other yeasts. The nucleus migrates to the daughter cell before dividing, and the kinetochores are unclustered until mitosis. We have shown that the evolutionarily conserved Aurora B kinase Ipl1 localizes to the nucleus upon the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis in C . neoformans . Ipl1 is required for timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope as well as for the clustering of kinetochores. We have also shown that the compromised stability of cytoplasmic microtubules upon Ipl1 depletion results in a significant delay in kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. By generating an in silico model of mitosis, we previously proposed that cytoplasmic microtubules and cortical dyneins promote atypical nuclear division in C . neoformans . Improving the previous in silico model by introducing additional parameters, here we predict that an effective cortical bias generated by cytosolic Bim1 and dynein regulates dynamics of kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. Indeed, in vivo alterations of Bim1 or dynein cellular levels delay nuclear migration. Results from in silico model and localization dynamics by live cell imaging suggest that Ipl1 spatio-temporally influences Bim1 or/and dynein activity along with microtubule stability to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. Together, we propose that the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope by Ipl1 allows its own nuclear entry that helps in spatio-temporal regulation of nuclear division during semi-open mitosis in C . neoformans .
 We have investigated a case of an aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harboring a somatic RET p . Cys634Arg mutation (a known MTC driver) and a germ-line RET substitution (p . Cys630=) that was considered clinically irrelevant because of its synonymous nature. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of the tumor tissues revealed that the RET mutations were in cis and there was no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis found an increase of RET transcript in p . Cys630=;p . Cys634Arg patient compared with that found in 7 MTCs harboring p . Cys634 mutations. Minigene expression assays demonstrated that the presence of the synonymous RET mutation was sufficient to explain the increased RET mRNA level. In silico analyses and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the p . Cys630 = variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs that enhanced SRp55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of its pre-mRNA and an increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor. These findings document a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression.
 Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of human infections. However, the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. In this study, we developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of “clean” eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.
 The study aimed to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda and the neighboring region of western Kenya. The study used 17 microsatellite loci to analyze 269 T. brucei isolates from Uganda and western Kenya. The results showed that the expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense. The study also confirmed the emergence of human infective strains from non-infective T. b. brucei strains of different genetic backgrounds and the importance of cattle as T. b. rhodesiense reservoir. The study also revealed the presence of genetic admixture among the three genetic clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and possibly ongoing gene flow between them. The study provides critical information for disease control and prevention.
 Thioredoxin-interacting protein ( TXNIP ) is a protein that has been shown to have multiple functions, including tumor suppression and involvement in cell proliferation and apoptosis . However, its role in the inflammatory process remains unclear. In this study, we found that Txnip−/− mice are significantly more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced endotoxic shock . In response to LPS , Txnip−/− macrophages produced significantly higher levels of nitric oxide ( NO ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , and an iNOS inhibitor rescued Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death , demonstrating that NO is a major factor in TXNIP-mediated endotoxic shock. This susceptibility phenotype of Txnip−/− mice occurred despite reduced IL-1β secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of NLRP3 compared to wild-type controls. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TXNIP is a novel molecule that links NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock.
 DNA damage is a major cause of cancer and other diseases. To prevent this, cells have evolved a complex system of DNA damage response (DDR) and repair pathways. In this study, we have identified a new protein called ZTF-8 that is involved in the repair of both mitotic and meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the germline of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that ZTF-8 localizes to both chromatin and the nucleolus and that its subcellular localization changes in response to DNA damage. We also found that ztf-8 mutants are sensitive to γ-irradiation and hydroxyurea, and that they accumulate recombination intermediates during both mitotic and meiotic progression. These results suggest that ZTF-8 plays a role in DSB repair and DDR. We also found that ZTF-8 interacts with the 9-1-1 DDR complex and that loss of ZTF-8 function results in partially impaired activation of germ cell apoptosis and the accumulation of RAD-51 foci. These results suggest that ZTF-8 plays a role in repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic DSBs as well as in meiotic DNA damage checkpoint response via the 9-1-1 pathway. Our findings define a conserved function for ZTF-8/RHINO in promoting genomic stability in the germline.
 The olfactory bulb ( OB ) is the first relay station in the brain where incoming odor information is processed . The OB is analogous to the retina in mammals . In the retina , repeated exposure to the same visual stimulus results in a neural representation that remains relatively stable over time . In the OB , repeated exposure to the same odor results in a neural representation that remains relatively stable over time . This study helps place the OB on this continuum of subjective versus objective early sensory representation . Here we show that odor responses of the output cells of the OB , mitral cells , change transiently during a go–no-go odor discrimination task . The response changes occur in a manner that increases the ability of the circuit to convey information necessary to discriminate among closely related odors . Remarkably , a switch between which of the two odors is rewarded causes mitral cells to switch the polarity of their divergent responses . Taken together these results redefine the function of the OB as a transiently modifiable ( active ) filter , shaping early odor representations in behaviorally meaningful ways .
2009 H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm) caused a global pandemic and raised concerns about the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines. In this study, we used a translational nonhuman primate model to investigate the role of T cells in early clearance of H1N1pdm infection. We first infected 5 rhesus macaques with a seasonal human H1N1 isolate and then challenged them with H1N1pdm 4 months later. In naive animals, activated CD8+ T cells appeared in blood and lung 5–7 days post inoculation (p.i.) with H1N1pdm and reached peak frequencies 7–10 days p.i. In contrast, activated T cells were recruited to the lung as early as 2 days p.i. in “primed” animals and reached peak frequencies in blood and lung 4–7 days p.i. Interferon (IFN)-γ Elispot and intracellular cytokine staining assays showed that the virus-specific response peaked earlier and reached a higher magnitude in “primed” animals than in naive animals. This response involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Strikingly, “primed” animals cleared H1N1pdm infection significantly earlier from the upper and lower respiratory tract than the naive animals did, and before the appearance of H1N1pdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that cross-reactive T cell responses can mediate early clearance of an antigenically novel influenza virus in primates. Vaccines capable of inducing such cross-reactive T cells may help protect humans against severe disease caused by newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses.
 Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii and is transmitted to humans through inhalation of contaminated dust or aerosols. The disease is difficult to diagnose because of the lack of specific clinical manifestations and the lack of identifiable features in infected animals. In this study, we developed a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay to detect C . burnetii rapidly and sensitively. The LAMP assay was evaluated using known quantities of recombined reference plasmids containing the targeted genes and compared with real-time PCR using 24 blood samples including 6 confirmed and 18 probable Q fever cases. The LAMP assay was also compared with real-time PCR using 126 animal samples from 4 provinces. The results showed that the LAMP assay was specific and sensitive, and could be used as a potential tool to support the diagnosis of Q fever in humans and domestic animals in the field.
 The discovery of enhancers, which regulate gene expression independently of their orientation, position, or distance relative to the transcription start site, has revolutionized our understanding of gene regulation. These regulatory elements are specific to certain cell types and can be found in active, inactive, or naïve non-regulatory chromatin states across cells. In this study, the authors explored transcriptional enhancers throughout hematopoietic cell development and derived cancers and discovered a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations. These mutations are particularly enriched in a group of enhancers, designated ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs), of the hematopoietic cell lineage. The authors found that hematopoietic ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, indicative of their chromatin activity states. Strikingly, ESSE methylation is associated with gene transcriptional activity in cancer. Constitutive or hematopoietic stem cell-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESSEs in cancer. The authors suggest that the discovered enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer.
 In this study, we investigate the effect of subdividing a population on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau. We use a simple model that includes only population subdivision into equivalent demes connected by global migration, and do not require significant size changes of the demes, environmental heterogeneity, or specific geographic structure. We determine the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision, if the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest. We show that isolated demes have to be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, we obtain analytical expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved: valley or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is then as fast as that of its fastest deme. We verify our analytical predictions through stochastic simulations. We demonstrate that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters extending beyond the optimal window. We study the effect of varying the degree of subdivision of a population, and investigate the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. Our results, obtained for fitness valleys and plateaus, also hold for weakly beneficial intermediate mutations. Finally, we extend our work to the case of a population connected by migration to one or several smaller islands. Our results demonstrate that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus, and shed light onto the quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur.
 Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes a severe flu-like illness in humans . The midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is the primary site of infection and replication of DENV . In this study, the authors used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the temporal metabolic perturbations that occur following DENV infection of the midgut tissue of Ae . aegypti . They identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic-profile across early-, mid- and late-infection time points. They observed a marked increase in the lipid content, elevation of glycerolipids, sphingolipids and fatty acyls, and an increase in acyl-carnitines. These results suggest that DENV infection disrupts the normal metabolic pathways of the mosquito midgut and that these disruptions are critical for the virus life cycle. The authors also identified several unidentified metabolites that may represent mosquito-specific metabolites that have not yet been annotated. These findings highlight biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes.
 We have developed a simple and parsimonious model of the rabbit action potential ( AP ) that reproduces several important electrophysiological phenomena measured from the same species under physiological conditions. The model is based on a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the rapid sodium current ( INa ) and a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying outward potassium current ( IK ). The model was calibrated using dynamic current-voltage ( I-V ) relationships during the AP upstroke, rapid recovery of AP excitability during the relative refractory period, and steady-state INa inactivation via voltage clamp. Simulations reproduced several important “emergent” phenomena including cellular alternans at rates > 250 bpm as observed in rabbit myocytes , reentrant spiral waves as observed on the surface of the rabbit heart , and spiral wave breakup. Model variants were studied which elucidated the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup , namely the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK . The simplicity of the model , and the fact that its parameters have physiological meaning , make it ideal for engendering generalizable mechanistic insight and should provide a solid “building-block” to generate more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology .
4-base 5′ overhangs are a characteristic feature of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in the ciliate Paramecium . These DSBs are generated by the domesticated transposase PiggyMac and are required for the precise excision of non-coding Internal Eliminated Sequences ( IESs ) during the sexual cycle. The excision of IESs is a complex process that involves the recognition and cleavage of both ends of each IES. In this study, the authors identified two genes in Paramecium that encode homologs of Ligase IV and Xrcc4p, which are essential actors of the non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) pathway. They found that Ligase IV and Xrcc4p are required for the repair of IES excision sites and for the circularization of excised IESs. The authors propose that the remarkable precision in end joining is largely driven by the characteristic structure of the broken ends generated during IES excision.
 Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is estimated that 9 million people are infected worldwide. The disease can cause heart failure, which is the leading cause of death in patients with Chagas disease. However, the current understanding of the mode of death in Chagas heart disease comes from a period before the introduction of drugs that changed the natural history of heart failure. In this study, we examined the REMADHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas vs non-Chagas) and mode of death. We found that death occurred in 56.4% of Chagas patients and 53.7% of non-Chagas patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas patients. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. In the Cox regression model, Chagas etiology, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, creatinine clearance, and use of amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure mortality. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter and use of beta-blocker were independently associated with sudden death mortality. These data challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications in the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death.
 The NSP-interacting kinase ( NIK ) receptor-mediated defense pathway has been identified as a virulence target of the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein ( NSP ). However, the NIK1–NSP interaction does not fit into the elicitor–receptor model of resistance, and hence the molecular mechanism that links this antiviral response to receptor activation remains obscure. In this study, the authors identified a ribosomal protein, rpL10A, as a specific partner and substrate of NIK1 that functions as an immediate downstream effector of NIK1-mediated response. Phosphorylation of cytosolic rpL10A by NIK1 redirects the protein to the nucleus where it may act to modulate viral infection. The authors also provide evidence that geminivirus infection directly interferes with NIK1-mediated nuclear relocalization of rpL10A as a counterdefensive measure. However, the NIK1-mediated defense signaling neither activates RNA silencing nor promotes a hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth and development. Although the virulence function of the particular geminivirus NSP studied here overcomes this layer of defense in Arabidopsis, the NIK1-mediated signaling response may be involved in restricting the host range of other viruses.
 Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a human fungal pathogen that causes Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a systemic mycosis that affects the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin. The fungus can survive and grow in the host by adapting to oxidative stress imposed by immune cells. In this study, we evaluated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX), an enzyme involved in intracellular redox balancing, during host-P . brasiliensis interaction. We generated a mitotically stable P . brasiliensis AOX antisense RNA (aRNA) strain with a 70% reduction in gene expression. We evaluated the relevance of PbAOX during interaction of conidia and yeast cells with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. Additionally, we determined the fungal cell's viability and PbAOX in the presence of H2O2. Interaction with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages induced higher levels of PbAOX gene expression in PbWt conidia than PbWt yeast cells. PbAOX-aRNA conidia and yeast cells had decreased viability after interaction with macrophages. Moreover, in a mouse model of infection, we showed that absence of wild-type levels of PbAOX in P . brasiliensis results in a reduced fungal burden in lungs at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and an increased survival rate. In the presence of H2O2, we observed that PbWt yeast cells increased PbAOX expression and presented a higher viability in comparison with PbAOX-aRNA yeast cells. These data further support the hypothesis that PbAOX is important in the fungal defense against oxidative stress imposed by immune cells and is relevant in the virulence of P . brasiliensis.
The hippocampus is thought to store episodic-like memories using attractor dynamics. A possible neural substrate for this memory mechanism is rate remapping, in which the spatial map of place cells encodes contextual information through firing rate variability. To test whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells, recent experiments morphed one familiar context into another while observing the responses of CA3 cell ensembles. Average population activity in CA3 was reported to transition gradually rather than abruptly from one familiar context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations. On the other hand, individual CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and some displayed hysteresis which is a signature of attractor dynamics. To understand whether these seemingly conflicting results are commensurate with attractor network theory, we developed a neural network model of the CA3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts. We found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. Smooth transition curves arose from averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels as experimentally observed when remapping between two independent spatial maps. Strong recurrent feedback entailed a hysteretic effect on the network which diminished with the amount of overlap in the stored memories. These results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells. Similar mechanisms for context-dependent memory may also be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex.
 Entamoeba histolytica is a microaerophilic protozoan parasite that causes amebic colitis and extra intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. Trophozoites of E . histolytica are exposed to a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. Since E . histolytica lacks key components of canonical eukaryotic anti-oxidative defense systems, such as catalase and glutathione system, alternative not-yet-identified anti-oxidative defense strategies have been postulated to be operating in E . histolytica. In the present study, we investigated global metabolic responses in E . histolytica in response to H2O2- and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress by measuring charged metabolites on capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found that oxidative stress caused drastic modulation of metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Oxidative stress resulted in the inhibition of glycolysis as a result of inactivation of several key enzymes, leading to the redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. As a result of the repression of glycolysis as evidenced by the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates upstream of pyruvate, and reduced ethanol production, the levels of nucleoside triphosphates were decreased. We also showed for the first time the presence of functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E . histolytica as demonstrated by the increased production of glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol upon oxidative stress. We proposed the significance of the glycerol biosynthetic pathway as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E . histolytica.
 IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression pattern is required for proper hematopoiesis . In collaboration with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase ( NuRD ) complex , it promotes gene repression and activation . Here , we demonstrate that NuRD and P-TEFb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS . The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α ( PP1α ) , an IKAROS-binding protein and P-TEFb activator , to CDK9 . We show that an IKAROS mutant that is unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impedes normal differentiation of IkNULL hematopoietic progenitors . Finally , the knock-down of the NuRD subunit Mi2 reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and thereby , promotes transcription elongation .
Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus that is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals. The virus is found in many parts of the world, including the Americas. In Trinidad, the virus is mainly transmitted by bats, and there have been several outbreaks in the past. In this study, researchers used genetic analysis to investigate the evolution of the rabies virus in Trinidad and to determine whether it is being introduced from other parts of the world. They found that there have been three separate introductions of the virus from the mainland of South America, and that the virus has evolved over time in Trinidad. The researchers suggest that further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between the rabies virus and the movement of bats between Trinidad and the mainland.
 The cerebral cortex is divided into many functionally distinct areas. The emergence of these areas during neural development is dependent on the expression patterns of several genes. We used a computational model of the interactions between these five genes to determine which interactions and combinations of interactions occur in networks that reproduce the anterior-posterior expression patterns observed experimentally. We found that only of these networks are able to reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These networks all lacked certain interactions and combinations of interactions including auto-regulation and inductive loops. Many higher order combinations of interactions also never appeared in networks that satisfied our criteria for good performance. While there was remarkable diversity in the structure of the networks that perform well, an analysis of the probability of each interaction gave an indication of which interactions are most likely to be present in the gene network regulating cortical area development. We found that in general, repressive interactions are much more likely than inductive ones, but that mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. Overall, our model illuminates the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development, and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally.
 Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins are important for controlling gene expression during development.  PcG proteins regulate gene expression by modifying histones, which are proteins that package DNA into chromatin.  One type of modification is the addition of a small protein called uH2A to histone H2A.  Recent studies have shown that uH2A is important for gene expression, but the genome-wide distribution of uH2A is not well understood.  Using a new technology called ChIP-Seq, we found that uH2A is enriched at the promoters of genes that are not actively expressed.  We also found that uH2A is enriched at high-density CpG promoters, which are regions of DNA that are heavily methylated.  These findings suggest that uH2A may play a role in regulating gene expression by modifying DNA methylation.  Overall, our study provides new insights into the role of uH2A in gene regulation.
 The mammary gland undergoes dramatic changes during pregnancy, lactation, and involution. A small population of alveolar progenitor cells remains in the involuted gland and rapidly differentiate into milk-producing cells in subsequent pregnancies. The molecular mechanisms that maintain these progenitor cells are unknown. In this study, we found that a noncoding RNA called mPINC is highly expressed in alveolar cells of the pregnant gland and in MECs that remain in the regressed lobules following involution. mPINC expression declines in early lactation as alveolar cells undergo terminal differentiation. Overexpression of mPINC blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of mPINC enhances differentiation. We also found that mPINC interacts with a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) called RbAp46. Our data suggest that mPINC inhibits differentiation of alveolar cells and that mPINC downregulation is necessary during lactation to allow alveolar cells to undergo terminal secretory differentiation. Additionally, a PRC2 complex that includes mPINC and RbAp46 may provide the epigenetic modifications that maintain a progenitor population of MECs committed to an alveolar fate in the pregnant and involuted gland.
 We present a study on the role of the protein PML in HIV-1 infection. PML is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins that are involved in antiviral defense. We found that HIV-1 infection triggers the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies, which are associated with a decrease in HIV-1 transduction efficiency. We also found that other retroviruses, but not viruses from other families, trigger PML cytoplasmic localization and increased transduction efficiency. We show that Daxx, a well-known interacting partner of PML, is the restriction factor that is affected by PML depletion. Daxx interferes with reverse-transcription and is thus able to inhibit retroviral infections but also retro-transposition events. Finally, we deciphered the exact role of PML in Daxx-mediated retroviral restriction by showing that PML stabilizes Daxx, which is rapidly degraded in PML knockdown cells. Our study confirms the involvement of PML in retroviral infection and reveals Daxx as a novel retroviral restriction factor targeting reverse-transcription.
 We introduce Matt, a new multiple protein structure alignment program that uses a novel approach to align protein structures. Matt allows local flexibility in the form of small translations and rotations to better model protein structures in a variety of contexts. Matt outperforms other popular multiple structure alignment programs on the Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets. Matt's ability to distinguish true alignable structures from decoys is tested on the SABmark dataset. We also introduce a p-value score based on the length of the common core and average RMSD that can be used to distinguish decoys from homologous protein structures. Matt's strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different conformational states and its ability to model backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins.
 The Greatwall kinase (Gwl) is a key regulator of the G2/M transition in the cell cycle. It inactivates the phosphatase PP2A/B55δ, which is required for mitotic entry. The phosphorylation of Gwl and its substrates Ensa and ARPP19 is regulated by Cdk1. In this study, the authors used mathematical modeling and experiments to investigate the dynamic regulation of Gwl and its substrates during mitotic entry and exit. They found that PP2A/B55δ is required for Gwl dephosphorylation at the essential Cdk site Thr194. Ensa/ARPP19 dephosphorylation is mediated by the RNA Polymerase II carboxy terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of neither Fcp1 nor PP2A appears to block dephosphorylation of the bulk of mitotic Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit. The authors suggest a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrate dephosphorylation during mitotic exit. Their findings provide new insights into the regulation of the G2/M transition and the control of mitotic kinase and phosphatase activity.
 We present a detailed analysis of the escape mechanisms used by HIV-1 to evade neutralizing antibodies (Nab) during early infection. We demonstrate that Nab escape readily occurred despite the development of high titer autologous Nab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection. To provide a detailed portrayal of the escape pathways, Nab resistant variants identified at multiple time points were used to create a series of envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a corresponding newly transmitted Env. In one subject, Nab escape was driven predominantly by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain (V3V5). However, Nab escape pathways in this subject oscillated and at times required cooperation between V1V2 and the gp41 ectodomain. In the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. This V1V2-dependent escape pathway was retained over time, and its utility was reflected in the virus's ability to escape from two distinct monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) derived from this same patient via introduction of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial representation of the sequence changes in gp120 suggested that selective pressure acted upon the same regions of Env in these two subjects, even though the Env domains that drove escape were different. Together the findings argue that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and support a model in which multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.
13 individuals of the plant species Capsella grandiflora were sequenced to determine the amount of positive and negative selection across the genome. The results show that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). However, estimates of selection on noncoding regions conserved across the Brassicaceae family show strong signals of selection. Additionally, reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions indicate recent selective sweeps at these sites. Finally, using expression data from leaf tissue, it was found that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, the results suggest that both positive and negative selection act in coding and regulatory regions, but that selection on plant noncoding sequence is considerably rarer than in animal genomes.
 Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a human tumor virus associated with various lymphoid and epithelial cell malignancies . EBNA2 is a viral gene product that drives naïve B-cells into a proliferative program resembling antigen-driven B-cell germinal center reaction . EBNA2 is a potent transcriptional co-activator that is expressed in early stages of EBV-induced proliferation of naïve B-cells, but its expression is extinguished at later stages of B-cell development . EBNA2 is best characterized for its physical interaction with the sequence-specific transcription factors RBP-jκ and EBF1 at promoters and enhancers of EBNA2-regulated genes. EBF1 and RBP-jκ are master regulatory transcription factors that play fate determining roles in lymphoid cell development. In this study, we show that EBNA2 induces the formation of new binding for both RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with transcriptional activation of linked genes that are important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EBNA2 leads to a rapid alteration in RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA depletion studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. These findings reveal that EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The primary vector of dengue virus is the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Previous studies have shown that Ae. aegypti populations exhibit genetic variation in their ability to become infected with, propagate, and transmit dengue viruses. In this study, the authors analyzed the genetic structure and vector competence of Ae. aegypti populations in Mexico. They found that there is a barrier to gene flow along the Gulf of Mexico coast in the state of Veracruz, and that mosquito populations north and south of this barrier differ in their vector competence for dengue virus. These findings suggest that the barrier to gene flow may be impacting the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. Further studies are needed to determine the cause of the barrier to gene flow and to determine whether the differences in vector competence seen north and south of the barrier are stable and epidemiologically significant.
 The bacterial replication cycle is driven by the DnaA protein which cycles between the active ATP-bound form and the inactive ADP-bound form . It has been suggested that DnaA also is the main controller of initiation frequency . Initiation is thought to occur when enough ATP-DnaA has accumulated . In this work we have performed cell cycle analysis of cells that contain a surplus of ATP-DnaA and asked whether initiation then occurs earlier . It does not . Cells with more than a 50% increase in the concentration of ATP-DnaA showed no changes in timing of replication . We suggest that although ATP-DnaA is the main actor in initiation of replication , its accumulation does not control the time of initiation. ATP-DnaA is the motor that drives the initiation process , but other factors will be required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell’s environment . We also investigated the in vivo roles of datA dependent DnaA inactivation ( DDAH ) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA . Loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein . The result indicates that compromised cell cycle machines perform in a less robust manner . , Introduction:  The ORC- and CDC6-like prokaryotic initiator protein DnaA has been studied extensively for many years , but it is still not clear whether the protein contributes to actual regulation of the initiation of replication or whether it works as a cell cycle motor which “licenses” initiation at regular intervals . In E . coli the DnaA protein causes strand opening and recruits the helicase and is thus the key contributor to initiation of replication [1 , 2] . The DnaA protein , bound to ATP or ADP [3] , binds to specific DnaA binding sites within the origin [4–6] . High-affinity binding sites can bind both forms of the DnaA protein [3–6] while low-affinity sites bind only the ATP-bound form [7] . The high-affinity boxes are most likely bound by DnaA throughout the cell cycle [8] , while binding to the “last” low-affinity sites has been suggested to trigger the initiation process at a time when the ATP-DnaA level has reached a threshold concentration [9] . Formation of a DnaA oligomer in the origin region causes the unwinding of the DNA in the AT-rich region and formation of the open complex [1 , 3] . This process is probably facilitated by transcription by RNA polymerase [10–13] and by DiaA , a DnaA-binding protein that has been shown to promote formation of ATP-DnaA complexes at oriC and stimulate oriC unwinding in vitro [14–16] . The DnaA protein also has a role as a transcription factor regulating its own transcription [17–20] and the transcription from several other promoters ( see [21] for review ) some of which are located close to or within the origin region [22] . More recently it was shown to interact directly with the RNA polymerase and to affect the transcription from the gidA promoter , which is situated right next to the origin [23] . The datA site is a 1 kb DNA sequence with five well conserved DnaA-boxes [24] and several weak DnaA-boxes [25] . The datA region has been thought to bind a large amount of the DnaA protein [24 , 26] , and thereby contribute to titrate the DnaA protein away from the origin . However , recently it was shown that datA , together with the IHF protein , has the ability to stimulate the hydrolysis of the DnaA-bound ATP and thereby inactivate the DnaA protein in a process called datA dependent inactivation of DnaA ( DDAH ) [27] . The level of ATP-DnaA is also affected by the RIDA ( Regulatory Inactivation of DnaA ) process , where the Hda protein together with the β-clamp of the polymerase stimulates the hydrolysis of the ATP bound to DnaA [28] . Mutations which block RIDA are lethal because they lead to massive over-initiation [29 , 30] whereas deletion of datA has minor impact on cell growth [26 , 31] indicating that
 We present a novel approach called partial Granger causality to reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. The method is extensively tested with toy models and successfully applied to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo multi-electrode array local field potentials recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep, and in vivo local field potentials recorded from distributed sites in the right hemisphere of a macaque monkey. Our approach is able to reveal the right causal relationship whereas other methods fail. We also apply our approach to three sets of experimental data and reveal the interaction patterns between different genes, brain areas, and neurons.
 In this paper, we present a new method for inferring local ancestry at each locus in the genome of recently admixed individuals, such as Latino Americans. Our method, Lanc-CSV, uses continent-specific variants (CSVs) to achieve increased performance over existing approaches in sequenced admixed genomes. We show that Lanc-CSV achieves comparable local ancestries to the 1000 Genomes consensus local ancestry calls in real admixed individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. We extend our approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and show that accurate local ancestry inference can be attained at low sequencing coverage. Finally, we generalize CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs) and show that in some cases it is possible to determine the sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments on the basis of sCSVs. Our method is significantly faster than existing standard haplotype-based approaches, making it the approach of choice for large-scale sequencing studies.
 In mammals, circadian periodicity has been described for gene expression in the hypothalamus and multiple peripheral tissues. It is accepted that 10%–15% of all genes oscillate in a daily rhythm, regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses of periodicity are limited by the small size of datasets and high levels of stochastic noise. Here, we propose a new approach applying digital signal processing algorithms separately to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase. Combined with the statistical tests for periodicity, this method identifies circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all expressed genes. Consequently, circadian oscillation in gene expression should be evaluated in any study related to biological pathways. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations or regulation of environmental factors (such as photic stimuli or feeding) should be considered in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations.
 Recombination is a key process in evolutionary biology and genetics. It occurs during meiosis and leads to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. The location of recombination events can provide valuable insights into the evolution of genomes and the mechanisms that drive it. In this study, we used whole-genome re-sequencing of a three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree to localize recombination events with high resolution. We identified 325 crossovers and 267 non-crossovers, and found that crossover rates were higher in male than in female meiosis, and increased towards chromosome ends in male but not female meiosis. We also found that crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome, with a concentration to genic regions, especially promoters and CpG islands. We further identified a significant transmission bias in favor of ‘strong’ (G, C) over ‘weak’ (A, T) alleles at non-crossover events, providing direct evidence for the process of GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system. Our approach should be applicable to any species and would thereby help to provide a more comprehensive portrait of the recombination landscape across organism groups.
 Repeat-proteins are made up of tandem arrays of similar stretches of amino acids that fold into elongated architectures. These proteins are important for many biological processes, but their folding behavior is not well understood. In this study, the authors present a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, which are the basic units of the protein. The authors show how the parameters for the “coarse-grained” description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. To illustrate the ideas, the authors present a case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins and quantitatively relate the results to the experimentally observed folding transitions. The authors speculate that natural repeat proteins are “poised” at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions.
 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly cancer that is often linked to chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. These conditions also cause the integrated stress response (ISR) or unfolded protein response (UPR), which are thought to contribute to HCC pathogenesis. In this study, the authors provide evidence that the ISR-regulated transcription factor CHOP promotes liver cancer. They show that CHOP expression is up-regulated in liver tumors in human HCC and two mouse models thereof. Chop-null mice are resistant to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, and these mice exhibit attenuation of both apoptosis and cellular proliferation. Chop-null mice are also resistant to fibrosis, which is a key risk factor for HCC. Global gene expression profiling suggests that deletion of CHOP reduces the levels of basal inflammatory signaling in the liver. The authors propose that CHOP contributes to hepatic carcinogenesis by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. They implicate CHOP as a common contributing factor in the development of HCC in a variety of chronic liver diseases.
 Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a chronic skin disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus. It is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide, with the highest burden in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. In Ethiopia, the etiological agent of CL is Leishmania aethiopica, which causes a range of clinical manifestations, including localized CL, diffuse CL, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. The evidence base for treatment of CL due to L. aethiopica is extremely limited, with only a few small and/or poor quality randomized controlled trials conducted a long time ago. Antimonials, cryotherapy, and pentamidine are the most commonly used drugs, but their efficacy and safety in CL should be better defined. Miltefosine and paromomycin are also used, but their evidence base is extremely scarce. The only potentially effective treatment options for diffuse CL seem to be antimonials with paromomycin in combination or pentamidine. High-quality trials on CL due to L. aethiopica are urgently needed, exploring group sequential methods to evaluate several options in parallel.
 The circadian clock is a biological mechanism that regulates the timing of daily activities. It is a self-sustained oscillator that can be reconstituted in vitro using three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. In this study, the authors used electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis to analyze the interactions of these proteins and their time-dependent formation of complexes. They also used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to confirm that monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers occurs. The authors derived a dynamic model for the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of KaiABC complexes and KaiC phosphorylation. They also applied the first perturbation analyses of the in vitro oscillator by using temperature pulses to reset the phase of the KaiABC oscillator. This study provides a detailed analysis of the biochemical basis of the circadian clock and its in vitro oscillator.
 In this study, we investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual stimulus detection task. We found that when the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity was closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate was higher and reaction times were faster. This relationship was present not only in the post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity, but also in the pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. Our findings are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and support attractor network theories, which postulate that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance.
 Sexual reproduction is a key evolutionary innovation of eukaryotes. In many species, mating involves interaction between compatible mating partners that can undergo cell and nuclear fusion and subsequent steps of development including meiosis. Mating compatibility in fungi is governed by the mating type (MAT) loci. In basidiomycetes, the ancestral state is hypothesized to be tetrapolar, with two genetically unlinked MAT loci containing homeodomain transcription factor genes (HD locus) and pheromone and pheromone receptor genes (P/R locus), respectively. However, there are also basidiomycetes with bipolar mating systems, which can arise through genomic linkage of the HD and P/R loci. In the order Tremellales, bipolarity is found only in the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. Here, we describe the analysis of MAT loci from 24 species of the Trichosporonales, a sister order to the Tremellales. In all of the species analyzed, the MAT loci are fused and a single HD gene is present in each mating type, similar to the organization in the pathogenic Cryptococci. However, the HD and P/R allele combinations in the Trichosporonales are different from those in the pathogenic Cryptococci. This and the existence of tetrapolar species in the Tremellales suggest that fusion of the HD and P/R loci occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and pathogenic Cryptococci, supporting the hypothesis of convergent evolution towards fused MAT regions, similar to previous findings in other fungal groups. Unlike the fused MAT loci in several other basidiomycete lineages though, the gene content and gene order within the fused MAT loci are highly conserved in the Trichosporonales, and there is no apparent suppression of recombination extending from the MAT loci to adjacent chromosomal regions. This suggests different mechanisms for the evolution of physically linked MAT loci in these groups.
 Chagas disease is a major vector-borne disease in Latin America, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to humans primarily by triatomine vectors. Non-domiciliated vectors remain responsible for a significant transmission risk, and their control is now a key challenge for disease control. A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses. Demographic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to two years of field data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. The predictive value of the model was tested on an independent data set before simulations examined the efficacy of control strategies based on residual insecticide spraying, insect screens, and bednets. The model accurately fitted and predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season. The >80% reduction in bug abundance was not improved by larger doses or more frequent interventions, and it decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. Alternatively, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. Control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying, because it would require yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
 Feathers are arranged in a precise pattern in avian skin. They first arise during development in a row along the dorsal midline, with rows of new feather buds added sequentially in a spreading wave. We show that the patterning of feathers relies on coupled fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) and bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) signalling together with mesenchymal cell movement, acting in a coordinated reaction-diffusion-taxis system. This periodic patterning system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration occurring through a positive feedback loop centred on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, mechanically compressing the epidermis to rapidly intensify FGF20 expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of Ectodysplasin A ( EDA ) , which initiates the expression of FGF20. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin to form a feather bud. These waves, and the precise arrangement of feather primordia, are lost in the flightless emu and ostrich, though via different developmental routes. The ostrich retains the tract arrangement characteristic of birds in general but lays down feather primordia without a wave, akin to the process of hair follicle formation in mammalian embryos. The embryonic emu skin lacks sufficient cells to enact feather formation, causing failure of tract formation, and instead the entire skin gains feather primordia through a later process. This work shows that a reaction-diffusion-taxis system, integrated with mechanical processes, generates the feather array. In flighted birds, the key role of the EDA/Ectodysplasin A receptor ( EDAR ) pathway in vertebrate skin patterning has been recast to activate this process in a quasi-1-dimensional manner, imposing highly ordered pattern formation.
2013–15 Ebola outbreak was unprecedented due to sustained transmission within urban environments and thousands of survivors. In 2014, the World Health Organization stated that there was insufficient evidence to give definitive guidance about which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a risk to humans. We report a rapid systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors. Scientific articles were screened for information about filovirus in human body fluids. The aim was to find primary data that suggested high likelihood of actively infectious filovirus in human body fluids (viral RNA). Eligible infections were from Marburg virus (MARV or RAVV) and Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. Cause of infection had to be laboratory confirmed (in practice either tissue culture or RT-PCR tests) or evidenced by compatible clinical history with subsequent positivity for filovirus antibodies or inflammatory factors. Data were extracted and summarized narratively. 6831 unique articles were found, and after screening, 33 studies were eligible. For most body fluid types, there were insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken >16 days after onset were usually negative. In the six studies that used both assay methods, RT-PCR tests for filovirus RNA gave positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every otherwise confirmed patient. Apart from semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR positive samples are likely to be culture negative and so possibly of low infectious risk. Nevertheless, it is not apparent how relatively infectious many body fluids are during or after illness, even when culture-positive, not least because most test results come from more severe cases. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission because of the known high viral loads in blood. , Keyword: ['ebola virus disease', 'filoviruses', 'body fluids', 'infectious risk', 'transmission pathways', 'viral load', 'diagnosis', 'clinical history', 'laboratory confirmation', 'tissue culture', 'reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction', 'RT-PCR', 'infectious disease', 'pathogenesis', 'epidemiology', 'clinical trials', 'clinical research', 'clinical data', 'clinical studies', 'clinical evidence', 'clinical research studies', 'clinical research data', 'clinical data studies', 'clinical data analysis', 'clinical data interpretation', 'clinical data review', 'clinical data summary', 'clinical data synthesis', 'clinical data integration', 'clinical data comparison', 'clinical data evaluation', 'clinical data assessment', 'clinical data analysis', 'clinical data interpretation', 'clinical data review', 'clinical data summary', 'clinical data synthesis', 'clinical data integration', 'clinical data comparison', 'clinical data evaluation', 'clinical data assessment', 'clinical data analysis', 'clinical data interpretation', 'clinical data review', 'clinical data summary', 'clinical data synthesis', 'clinical data integration', 'clinical data comparison', 'clinical data evaluation', 'clinical data assessment', 'clinical data analysis', 'clinical data interpretation', 'clinical data review', 'clinical data summary', 'clinical data synthesis', 'clinical data integration', 'clinical data comparison', 'clinical data evaluation', 'clinical data assessment', 'clinical data analysis', 'clinical data interpretation', 'clinical data review', 'clinical data summary', 'clinical data synthesis', 'clinical data integration', 'clinical data comparison', 'clinical data evaluation', 'clinical data assessment', 'clinical data analysis', 'clinical data interpretation', 'clinical data review', 'clinical data summary', 'clinical data synthesis', 'clinical data integration', 'clinical data comparison', 'clinical data evaluation', 'clinical data assessment', 'clinical data analysis', 'clinical data interpretation', 'clinical data review', 'clinical data summary', 'clinical data synthesis', '
 Neurons are specialized cells that communicate with each other through electrical signals called action potentials. The leaky integrate-and-fire model is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of neurons. In this model, the voltage of the neuron changes over time due to the influx and efflux of charged particles called ions. The voltage of the neuron can also be affected by the activity of other neurons, which can cause the voltage to change in a non-linear way. This non-linearity can be described using a mathematical concept called a fractional derivative. In this study, the authors developed a new version of the leaky integrate-and-fire model that includes a fractional derivative. They found that this new model can better describe the behavior of neurons in certain situations, such as when the neuron is receiving input from other neurons. The authors also found that the new model can better explain certain properties of neuronal behavior, such as the way that neurons adapt to changes in their input over time. Overall, the study shows that the inclusion of a fractional derivative in the leaky integrate-and-fire model can improve our understanding of how neurons work.
 Paracoccidioides is a fungal pathogen that causes a systemic mycosis in humans. It exists in two forms: mycelium at low temperatures and yeast at higher temperatures. To survive, Paracoccidioides must defend itself against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host effector cells and by its own metabolism. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are enzymes that help Paracoccidioides neutralize ROS. In this study, we identified six SODs isoforms encoded by the Paracoccidioides genome and determined their gene expression levels in different life cycle stages and under different conditions. We also used antisense RNA technology to further evaluate the role of specific isoforms. Our results suggest that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are involved in the response of the fungus against host effector cells, particularly the oxidative stress response.
 Intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) are proteins that do not have a fixed three-dimensional structure and are highly sensitive to proteolysis in vitro . However, they are not degraded at a higher rate in vivo . It has been suggested that IDPs are associated with chaperones in the cell, which may protect them from degradation by proteases . In this study, we analyzed pairwise interaction data from high-throughput interaction studies to test this hypothesis. Our major finding is that predicted disorder actually shows a negative correlation with chaperone binding in E . coli , S . cerevisiae , and metazoa species. We argue that chaperone binding is primarily required for folding of globular proteins, as reflected in an increased preference for chaperones of proteins in which at least one Pfam domain exists. In terms of the functional consequences of chaperone binding of mostly disordered proteins, we suggest that its primary reason is not the assistance of folding, but promotion of assembly with partners. In support of this conclusion, we show that IDPs that bind chaperones also tend to bind other proteins.
 The Drosophila wing imaginal disc is a complex tissue that grows and differentiates during development. The wing disc is controlled by a variety of signaling pathways, including the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) pathway. The Dpp pathway regulates cell viability and motility during dorsal closure, but also controls growth and patterning during imaginal disc development. The Spalt proteins, Salm and Salr, are Zn-finger transcription factors that are regulated by the Dpp pathway and are required for wing growth and patterning. In this study, the authors used microarray analysis to identify candidate Salm/Salr target genes in the wing disc. They found that Salm/Salr regulate both the activation and repression of gene expression in the wing disc. The authors also used in situ hybridization and phenotypic analysis to validate their findings and identify a collection of candidate genes that are regulated by the Spalt proteins. Their work provides new insights into the genetic hierarchy controlling wing growth and patterning in Drosophila.
 In this study, we investigated the regulation of centriole duplication in the nematode worm C. elegans. We found that the protein kinase Plk4, which is required for centriole duplication, is regulated by the protein phosphatase PP1. We also identified two PP1 regulators, I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22, that are required for the regulation of Plk4. We found that down-regulation of PP1 activity can rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. Our results suggest that PP1 regulates Plk4 through a post-translational mechanism and that PP1 regulates centriole duplication by controlling the levels of Plk4. This study provides new insights into the regulation of centriole duplication and highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that control centriole number in development and disease.
 Leishmaniasis is a rapidly expanding zoonosis that shows increasing urbanization. Concern exists regarding the role of wildlife in visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) transmission, due to frequent natural or anthropogenic environmental changes that facilitate contact between wildlife, humans, and their pets. The municipality of Campinas, in southeastern Brazil, initially recorded VL in 2009, when the first autochthonous case was confirmed in a dog living in an upscale residential condominium located inside an environmentally protected area ( EPA ). Since then, disease transmission remains restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA. We conducted a cross-sectional study of the VL focus to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular tools and recommended serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six insect species, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified. Two specimens of the main L. ( L . ) infantum vector in Brazil, Lutzomyia longipalpis, were captured in the EPA. Natural infection by L. ( L . ) infantum was recorded in one Expapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola. Natural infection by L. ( L . ) infantum and Leishmania subgenus Viannia was also detected in two white-eared opossums ( Didelphis albiventris ). Geographical coordinates of each sampling of infected animals were plotted on a map of the EPA, demonstrating proximity between these animals, human residences, including the dogs positive for VL, and forest areas. The EPA, which is inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios, i.e., wild areas that undergo environmental modifications, is evident. Different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included to elaborate prevention and control measures that consider the particularities of each transmission area.
 Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a common human virus that causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several types of cancer, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ). EBV encodes a large number of microRNAs ( miRNAs ), which are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. In this study, we investigated the role of one of these miRNAs, miR-BART9, in NPC. We found that miR-BART9 promotes the migration and invasiveness of NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. We also discovered that miR-BART9 directly targets the E-cadherin gene, which is important for maintaining the epithelial cell phenotype and suppressing metastasis. Our results suggest that miR-BART9 is a prometastatic viral miRNA that contributes to the aggressiveness of NPC.
 Alternative splicing is a process that produces different combinations of exons from the same gene, resulting in a variety of mature transcripts. Visualizing splicing events is crucial for exploratory data analysis, but current visualization tools are annotation-dependent and cannot handle large genomic regions. We present ggsashimi, a command-line tool for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. It creates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments. ggsashimi is annotation-independent and allows the visualization of splicing events even for large genomic regions by scaling down the genomic segments between splice sites. It is freely available at https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi and is implemented in python.
 West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that has been circulating in North America since 1999. The house sparrow (HOSP) is a highly competent host for WNV that has contributed to its rapid spread across the U.S. However, the competence of HOSPs for WNV has been evaluated primarily using an early WNV strain (NY99) that is no longer circulating. Here, the authors report that the competence of wild HOSPs for the NY99 strain has decreased significantly over time, suggesting that HOSPs may have developed resistance to this early WNV strain. Moreover, recently isolated WNV strains generate higher peak viremias and mortality in contemporary HOSPs compared to NY99. These data indicate that opposing selective pressures in both the virus and avian host have resulted in a net increase in the level of host competence of North American HOSPs for currently circulating WNV strains. This study provides new insights into the different ways WNV activates the immune response to evade destruction in the host.
19-22 nt piRNAs are small RNAs that play a role in transposon silencing and genome integrity in the germline of Drosophila. In this study, the authors found that mutations in piRNA pathway genes led to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during the cleavage stage of embryonic divisions. Additionally, the authors found that mutations in two piRNA pathway genes, aub and armi, disrupted telomere binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduced expression of a subpopulation of 19-22 nt telomere-specific piRNAs. The authors also found that mutations in lig-IV, which disrupts non-homologous end joining, enhanced chromosome fragmentation. These findings uncover genetically separable functions for the Drosophila piRNA pathway, including transposon silencing and maintenance of chromosome integrity during cleavage-stage embryonic divisions, as well as assembly of the telomere protection complex.
 In November 2007, a hemorrhagic fever outbreak occurred in Bundibugyo District, Western Uganda. The initial 29 suspect-case blood specimens were tested using classic methods (antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA) and a recently developed random-primed pyrosequencing approach. The laboratory investigation quickly identified this to be an Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak associated with a newly discovered ebolavirus species (Bundibugyo ebolavirus) distantly related to the Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus found in western Africa. The findings have important implications for the design of future diagnostic assays to monitor Ebola hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and animals, and ongoing efforts to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.
648 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients were followed for an average of 4.78 years, and the duration of each Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) stage was calculated. The standard deviations for GDS stages 4–6 were comparable with their mean values, indicating a large amount of heterogeneity in the course of AD progression among patients. This heterogeneity is consistent with the existence of several sub-groups of AD patients that differ by their patterns of decline. The GDS/Functional Assessment Staging procedure (FAST) is a widely used instrument to stage the course of AD, and it has been shown to correlate with both behavioral measures and anatomic brain changes. However, the quantification of the variance of GDS/FAST stage durations is essential to compare the delay gained by a treatment strategy with the amount of natural variation in stage durations. This study provides a quantitative measure of the amount of heterogeneity in AD progression rates and their variances among patients for each stage of AD.
 In this study, we extended our previous model of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. We compared network performance across a sequence of spatial environments using three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. We confirmed that additive neurogenesis is a superior adaptation strategy when using realistic, spatially structured input patterns. We then showed that a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporates cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells has an overall performance significantly better than any one of the three individual strategies operating alone. We also examined the time course of adult neurogenesis over the lifetime of an animal raised under different hypothetical rearing conditions. These growth profiles have several distinct features that form a theoretical prediction that could be tested experimentally. Finally, we showed that place cells can emerge and refine in a realistic manner in our model as a direct result of the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer.
 The study investigates the role of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in African trypanosomes, which are the causative agents of human sleeping sickness and Nagana cattle disease. The study shows that the lysosome, not the mitochondrion, is the primary site of oxidative damage in these parasites. The cytosolic GPx I-II enzymes protect the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation. The study also reveals that the mitochondrial GPx III is fully dispensable for parasitism. The study has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of oxidative stress in African trypanosomes and for developing new therapeutic strategies against these parasites.
 PMEL is a protein that is expressed exclusively in pigment cells and forms intralumenal fibrils within early stage melanosomes upon which eumelanins deposit in later stages . PMEL is well conserved among vertebrates and allelic variants in several species are associated with reduced levels of eumelanin in epidermal tissues . However, in most of these cases it is not clear whether the allelic variants reflect gain-of-function or loss-of-function . Here, we have created a mouse line in which the Pmel gene has been inactivated ( Pmel−/− ) . These mice are fully viable, fertile, and display no obvious developmental defects. Melanosomes within Pmel−/− melanocytes are spherical in contrast to the oblong shape present in wild-type animals. This feature was documented in primary cultures of skin-derived melanocytes as well as in retinal pigment epithelium cells and in uveal melanocytes. Inactivation of Pmel has only a mild effect on the coat color phenotype in four different genetic backgrounds, with the clearest effect in mice also carrying the brown/Tyrp1 mutation. This phenotype, which is similar to that observed with the spontaneous silver mutation in mice, strongly suggests that other previously described alleles in vertebrates with more striking effects on pigmentation are dominant-negative mutations. Despite a mild effect on visible pigmentation, inactivation of Pmel led to a substantial reduction in eumelanin content in hair, which demonstrates that PMEL has a critical role for maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Vector control is the primary method to prevent dengue infections. Environmental interventions represent sustainable and safe methods as there are limited risks of environmental contamination and toxicity. In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of the following environmental methods for dengue vector control: container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up campaigns, and elimination of breeding sites by rendering potential mosquito breeding sites unusable or by eliminating them. Our results showed that all three methods had some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence.
 The discovery of small molecules that selectively inhibit protein synthesis by stalling the ribosome has opened up a new avenue for therapeutic development . These compounds have been identified that reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in preclinical models and affect the translation of only a few off-target proteins . However, it is not known how these compounds impact the physiology of cells or ribosome quality control pathways . In this study, we used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of a selective PCSK9 translational inhibitor, PF-06378503 (PF8503). The two most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503, the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3, bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. In genetic interaction experiments, ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2, and functions downstream of HBS1L. These results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways and provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation, which will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease.
The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) is a human herpesvirus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare tumor found predominantly in elderly Mediterranean or African men. KSHV promotes widespread destruction of cellular mRNAs to block host gene expression and evade immune detection. The viral factor SOX (shutoff and exonuclease) is responsible for this host shutoff phenotype. SOX stimulates cellular transcriptome turnover via a unique mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. SOX-induced polyadenylation changes correlate with its RNA turnover function, and inhibition of poly (A) tail formation blocks SOX activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly (A) binding proteins are critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, the latter of which undergoes striking nuclear relocalization by SOX. SOX-induced mRNA turnover therefore represents both a novel mechanism of host shutoff as well as a new model system to probe the regulation of poly (A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.
 The interferon ( IFN ) family is composed of three subgroups ( types I , II , and III IFN ) , and through their distinct receptors , IFNs signal through STAT transcription factors to upregulate expression of over 300 IFN dependent genes . In the lung bacterial pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) can be internalized and thus gain access to the intracellular receptors involved in type I IFN signaling [1]–[3] . Activation of type I IFN signaling can be either protective or detrimental to the host depending on the specific pathogen [4]–[9] . Type I IFNs promote the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus pulmonary infection through upregulation of CXCR3 chemokines and T-cell recruitment while improving eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by reducing inflammasome signaling [1] , [10]–[16] . Interferons induce expression of downstream genes through distinct receptors . Type I IFN signals through the ubiquitously expressed interferon-α/β receptor ( IFNAR ) , while the type III IFN ( IFNλ ) family , composed of IL-28A/B and IL-29 , signals through the more cell specific receptor complex of IL-10R2 and IL-28R [17]–[21] . Following activation of either IFN pathway , an autocrine signaling network mediates the cellular response , primarily through JAK/STAT signaling and the induction of IFN dependent gene expression . It would seem that the two IFNs activate redundant downstream signaling pathways . However altered signaling kinetics and the limited distribution of IL-28R , restricted primarily to mucosal tissues , suggest distinct roles for type I and type III IFN depending on the infection site [22]–[28] . For example in the lung type III IFN is the primary IFN produced by respiratory epithelial cells in response to viral stimulation and is required for clearance of influenza from the airway [29]–[32] . Several of the immunological effects of IFNλ such as upregulation of MHC I and II , induction of NF-κB dependent cytokine production and effects on DC maturation and differentiation , could be highly relevant to the pathogenesis of bacterial infection [33]–[36] . Interferon signaling is linked to the regulation of micro RNAs , small non-coding RNA inhibitors of mRNA translation capable of directly influencing innate immune signaling [4]–[9] . In tumor cells , miR-21 targets the tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4 ( PDCD4 ) promoting tumor growth and contributing to the inflammatory tumor microenvironment [1] , [10]–[16] . PDCD4 represses translation of cellular mRNA through its binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4A ( eIF4A ) [17]–[21] . Phosphorylation of PDCD4 by the ribosomal S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) results in release of eIF4A from PDCD4 , ubiquitin dependent degredation of PDCD4 , and enhanced mRNA translation [22]–[28] . Inflammatory cytokine production in response to toll like receptor ( TLR ) 2 or 4 activation by decorin or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is significantly influenced by expression of miR-21 and PDCD4 [29]–[32] . Therefore the pro-inflammatory contribution of PDCD4 to host signaling during bacterial pneumonia could significantly contribute to lung pathology [33]–[36] . In the experiments detailed in this report , we examined the importance of type III IFNs in the innate immune response to two major airway pathogens , USA300 MRSA and P . aeruginosa , currently the most common causes of ventilator associated pneumonia [37] , [38] . We found that IFNλ is induced in the course of bacterial airway infection and results in downregulation of the microRNA miR-21 , sustained expression of PDCD4 , and increased proinflammatory cytokine production . Mice lacking the IFNλ receptor , IL-28R , or PD
781 patients with advanced stage-2 sleeping sickness were admitted to a hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1989 and 2012. The patients were treated with different drugs, and the study looked at the factors that affected their mortality. The factors that affected mortality included the patient's age, gender, duration of disease, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cytorachy, protidorachy, clinical status on admission, and treatment regimen. The study found that the most effective treatment was the short schedule melarsoprol, with a mortality rate of 12.1%. The least effective treatment was the selectively severely affected patients given eflornithine, with a mortality rate of 36%. The study also found that high protidorachy, the presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid, and clinical dysfunction on admission were significant predictors of mortality. The study recommends that clinical status on admission should be assessed using a standardized tool to facilitate comparison of results in large-scale multicenter studies.
 Social isolation has profound effects on human behavior and health. In Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for studying small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior, isolation has been shown to affect gene expression and metabolism. However, tracking and analyzing large groups of flies has been challenging due to the lack of effective and reliable tools. We developed a new imaging arena and improved the existing tracking algorithm to reliably follow a large number of flies simultaneously. We then designed an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. We observed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. We explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that whereas behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred mostly on day one. These changes occurred mostly in metabolic genes, and we verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies. In summary, we describe a highly reliable tracking and analysis pipeline for large groups of flies that we use to unravel the behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in Drosophila.
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) diarrheal disease management guidelines  are widely used in clinical practice, but they are not always accessible or user-friendly in resource-limited settings. To address this issue, we developed a smartphone adaptation of these guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation. We conducted a clinical pilot study in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of this tool on clinical care. The study consisted of a 6 week pre-intervention and 6 week intervention period with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for intravenous ( IV ) fluids decreased at both hospitals, with risk ratios ( RRs ) of 0 . 5 and 0 . 2 , respectively. When IV fluids were prescribed, the volume better adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin increased, with RRs of 6 . 9 and 1 . 6 at the district and sub-district hospitals, respectively, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased. Zinc adherence increased. Limitations included an absence of a concurrent control group and no independent dehydration assessment during the pre-intervention. Despite these limitations, opportunities were identified to improve clinical care, including better assessment, weight estimation, and fluid/antibiotic selection. These findings demonstrate that a smartphone-based tool can improve guideline adherence. This study should serve as a catalyst for a randomized controlled trial to expand on the findings and address limitations.
Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases. However, it is difficult to predict how host-parasite systems will respond to changing temperatures. In this study, we used experimental data from Daphnia magna and its microsporidian parasite to fit a mechanistic model of within-host parasite population dynamics. We found that the thermal dependencies of host and parasite traits affecting within-host parasite dynamics and host survival are well described by variants of the Van’t Hoff–Arrhenius and Sharpe–Schoolfield models. Our results demonstrate the predictive power of linking MTE-based thermal relationships for host and parasite traits in mechanistic within-host parasite models to understand the impacts of temperature changes on disease.
 GABAergic interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain. However, the functional roles of different interneuron types and how they are supported by their individual characteristics are still largely unknown. Here, we propose a functional role for a widespread network motif consisting of parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. We suggest that mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells translates weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes of somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we show that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled. Our findings suggest that the SOM-VIP motif plays a key role in the redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition and in the control of different input streams in the brain.
 Microbiota, the collection of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, have been linked to many aspects of human health and disease. To identify specific microbes associated with specific diseases, researchers use a technique called microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS). However, MWAS can produce many spurious associations that do not reflect direct links between microbes and diseases. In this study, the authors developed a new method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Their method, called Direct Association Analysis (DAA), corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. The direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in IBD. This study highlights the importance of considering microbial interactions when analyzing microbiome data and provides a new tool for identifying direct links between microbes and diseases.
 Wolbachia is a bacterium that infects many insect species and has been shown to have a variety of effects on its host, including blocking the transmission of some viruses. In this study, the authors compared the effects of Wolbachia on two different mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Culex tarsalis, using two different infection models: stable transinfection and transient somatic infection. They found that Wolbachia had similar blocking effects on both mosquito species and both infection models, but the magnitude of the blocking effect was significantly lower in mosquitoes transiently infected with Wolbachia. The authors conclude that their results provide evidence that Wolbachia can be used as a natural control method for mosquito-borne pathogens such as dengue virus and West Nile virus.
Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that mediate signal transduction and are found in many cell types. In vertebrates, the cystoprotein Inversin localizes to a portion of the cilia shaft adjacent to the transition zone, a region termed the “Inversin compartment” (InvC). The mechanisms that establish and maintain the InvC are unknown. In the roundworm C. elegans, the cilia shafts of amphid channel and phasmid sensory cilia are subdivided into two regions defined by different microtubule ultrastructure: a proximal doublet-based region adjacent to the transition zone, and a distal singlet-based region. It has been suggested that C. elegans cilia also possess an InvC, similarly to mammalian primary cilia. Here we explored the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C. elegans ciliary doublet region and InvC. We show that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.
 Myelin sheaths are essential for rapid and efficient nerve conduction in the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin sheaths are formed by oligodendrocytes, which are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. During myelination, oligodendrocytes undergo profound changes in cell shape that lead to myelin sheath initiation and formation. Here, we demonstrate that the basal polarity complex protein Scribble is required for myelination and remyelination. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes where it is localized to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. When Scribble expression is conditionally eliminated in the myelinating glia of transgenic mice, myelin initiation in the CNS is disrupted, both during development and following focal demyelination, and longitudinal extension of the myelin sheath is disrupted. At later stages of myelination, Scribble acts to negatively regulate myelin thickness while suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathway and localizes to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the evolutionarily-conserved regulators of intracellular polarity in myelination and remyelination.
 Streptolysin S (SLS) is a bacteriocin-like virulence factor produced by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) that contributes to its virulence by causing haemolysis and cytotoxicity. SLS is a post-translationally modified peptide that is rich in cysteines, glycines, and hydroxylated amino acids. It has been found that SLS-like virulence factors are also produced by other Gram-positive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, and Staphylococcus aureus. The genetic basis for the production of these virulence factors has been revealed, and it has been shown that they play a role in the virulence of these pathogens. The genetic basis for the production of these virulence factors has been revealed, and it has been shown that they play a role in the virulence of these pathogens.
Mycetoma is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. The disease is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The present study aimed to determine the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma granulomas. The study found that IL-17 was mainly expressed in zones I and II, while MMP-9 was expressed in zones II and III. The study also found that MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to the levels of IL-17. The only significant association between MMP9 and the patients’ characteristics was the disease duration. There was an insignificant correlation between the IL-17 levels and the patients’ demographic characteristics. The study suggests that IL-17 and MMP-9 play important roles in the formation of mycetoma granulomas.
200-300 words. The study of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) has revealed that they play important roles in various biological processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their function are not well understood. The study of Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family (EFP) activation domain (EAD) has provided a model for understanding the function of IDPs. EAD is a polyvalent IDP that exhibits fuzziness, a phenomenon characterized by polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity, and a dynamic ensemble of disordered bound-state conformations. The study of EAD has been hindered by its IDP properties and a lack of biophysical/biochemical insights. The study has also been complicated by the paucity of information regarding cognate EAD-interacting proteins. The study has revealed that the transcriptional and oncogenic activity of EAD is conferred by multiple tyrosine (Y) residues due to their aromaticity but not hydrophobicity. The study has also shown that EAD function is markedly sequence-insensitive. The study has provided a foundation for understanding the sequence-function relationship of EAD. The study has also revealed that molecular recognition by EAD is driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. The study has also shown that the polycation-π model is supported by experimental and theoretical interrogation of EAD variants. The study has provided a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs.

 Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by ticks. The bacterium has two putative ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2. In this study, we found that Lon-1 is upregulated in B. burgdorferi exposed to blood in vitro, while Lon-2 is not. We also found that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-1 is involved in host adaptation during the transition from tick to mammal, while Lon-2 fulfills the role of canonical Lon and is involved in cellular quality control and homeostasis. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of B. burgdorferi adaptation to different hosts and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for Lyme disease.
 The study aimed to investigate the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing HIV infection. The authors used green-fluorescent protein-expressing HIV-1JRFL virions and HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to measure the ability of HIV-specific antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. The authors found minimal or no ADP of virions with any of the antibodies, but after coating virions with gp41 or with gp41-derived peptides, gp41-specific mAbs efficiently mediated phagocytosis. The authors estimated that a minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, which is similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed. The authors also found a clear association between virus aggregation and ADP. In contrast to virions themselves, virion-decorated cells were targets for ADP or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. The authors concluded that ADP of virions may not play a role in preventing HIV infection, likely due to the paucity of trimers and the consequent inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link FcyRs on phagocytes. However, ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection.
The economic and health burden of hookworm infection is not well known, making it difficult for decision makers to determine how much time, energy, and resources to invest in hookworm control. We developed a computational simulation model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection worldwide, in every country, and in WHO regions. Globally, hookworm infection resulted in 2,126,280 DALYs using 2004 disability weight estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 2010 disability weight estimates (excluding cognitive impairment outcomes). Including cognitive impairment did not significantly increase DALYs worldwide. Total productivity losses varied with the probability of anemia and calculation method used, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages and ranging from $2.5 billion to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy for annual wages. Even though hookworm is classified as a neglected tropical disease, its economic and health burden exceeded published estimates for a number of diseases that have received comparatively more attention than hookworm. Certain large countries that are transitioning to higher income countries such as Brazil and China still face considerable hookworm burden.
30% of premature infants experience neurodevelopmental impairments due to chronic hypoxic injury. The mechanisms of hypoxic injury to the developing human brain are poorly understood. Recent work in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that hypoxia causes discrete axon pathfinding errors in certain interneurons and motorneurons. However, it is unknown whether developmental hypoxia would have similar effects in a vertebrate nervous system. We have found that developmental hypoxic injury disrupts pathfinding of forebrain neurons in zebrafish, leading to errors in which commissural axons fail to cross the midline. The pathfinding defects result from activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway and are mimicked by chemical inducers of the hif1 pathway or by expression of constitutively active hif1α. Further, we found that blocking transcriptional activation by hif1α helped prevent the guidance errors. We identified ephrinB2a as a target of hif1 pathway activation, showed that knock-down of ephrinB2a rescued the guidance errors, and showed that the receptor ephA4a is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons. By targeting a constitutively active form of ephrinB2a to specific neurons, we found that ephrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Finally, magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2a. These results demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia, and they support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium.
 Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal disease that affects the lungs and other organs. It is caused by the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis fungus. In this study, researchers used high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to monitor the progression of PCM in mice. They found that HRCT was useful for identifying patterns of lung lesions and quantifying lung density. The study also showed that HRCT could be used to monitor treatment efficacy in PCM. This study highlights the potential of HRCT as a non-invasive tool for monitoring the progression of PCM in mice and for evaluating treatment efficacy.
 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe form of leishmaniasis that affects the spleen, liver, and other internal organs. It is caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani and is endemic in certain regions of the world, including India, Nepal, and Brazil. The disease is often fatal if left untreated. However, many people who are infected with L. donovani do not develop the disease, and it is not clear why. In this study, the authors propose a new way to detect L. donovani infection using an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA). They modified a commercial kit called QuantiFERON to include five different leishmania-specific antigens, and they tested the assay on blood samples from people with active VL, cured VL, healthy endemic controls, and healthy non-endemic controls. The assay based on soluble leishmania antigen (SLA) had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100%. The authors suggest that this assay could be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection and could help with the elimination program for VL.
Yersiniae are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal infections in humans. These infections can become persistent and lead to severe autoimmune disorders. In this study, we show that the CNFY toxin, which enhances the translocation of the antiphagocytic Yop effectors, induces inflammatory responses. This results in extensive tissue destruction, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance. Suppression of CNFY function, however, increases interferon-γ-mediated responses, comprising non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This process is accompanied by a preterm reprogramming of the pathogen's transcriptional response towards persistence, which gives the bacteria a fitness edge against host responses and facilitates the establishment of a commensal-type life style.
 In this study, we identified a novel pathogenicity gene, DES1, in Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. We found that DES1 is required for the successful colonization of rice plants and for the suppression of plant defense responses. We demonstrated that DES1 functions as a pathogenicity factor that compromises oxidative signaling in plants. Our results suggest that DES1 serves as a key regulator of fungal virulence in the early infectious stage of the plant–fungus interaction.
 Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by infection with trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma, which are transmitted through freshwater snails. The current study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of model-based geostatistics (MBG) predictions for Schistosoma haematobium infection in Ghana. To do this, school surveys were conducted in 79 sites to gather empiric prevalence values that could be compared with values derived from recently published MBG predictions. Based on these findings, schools were categorized according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines so that practical implications of any differences could be determined. Using the mean predicted values alone, 21 of the 25 empirically determined ‘high-risk’ schools requiring yearly praziquantel would have been undertreated, and almost 20% of the remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection. Using the current predictive map for Ghana as a spatial decision support tool by aggregating prevalence estimates to the district level was clearly not adequate for guiding the national program. The study concludes that for practical usefulness, predictive risk mapping should not be thought of as a one-time exercise but must be an iterative process that incorporates empiric testing and model refining to create updated versions that meet the needs of disease control operational managers.
 In this study, the authors investigate the role of prostaglandins in sperm guidance during fertilization in Caenorhabditis elegans. They show that oocytes synthesize F-series prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) precursors provided in yolk lipoprotein complexes. They also show that multiple F-series prostaglandins function collectively to promote sperm motility important for fertilization. The authors use genetics and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to delineate F-series prostaglandin metabolism pathways. They find that omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs are converted into more than 10 structurally related F-series prostaglandins, which function collectively and largely redundantly to promote sperm motility important for fertilization. The authors also show that a conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Bietti's Crystalline Dystrophy, negatively regulates prostaglandin synthesis. These results support the model that multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins function together to promote sperm motility important for fertilization. This cyclooxygenase-independent pathway for F-series synthesis may be conserved.
 The development of biotherapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat various diseases. However, the immunogenicity of these proteins can pose a barrier to their widespread clinical application. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes protein function and reduces immunogenicity. The algorithm, called Pepfr, generates a spectrum of designs that exhibit tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and molecular function. We have experimentally validated the Pepfr algorithm by designing and producing 18 Pareto optimal variants of a therapeutic enzyme. Our results show that the Pepfr algorithm can be used to rapidly assess and design for tradeoffs between protein immunogenicity and functionality. This approach may prove useful in augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts.
 In plants, meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid gametes from diploid progenitor cells. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes exchange DNA through a process called crossing-over (CO). COs are critical for stabilizing homologous chromosome pairing and ensuring proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, COs are formed through two pathways: the interference-sensitive Type I pathway and the interference-insensitive Type II pathway. In this study, we show that elevated temperature induces meiotic hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana and that the extra COs are derived from the Type I interference-sensitive pathway. We also show that heat-induced COs are not the result of an increase in DNA double-strand breaks and that the hyper-recombinant phenotype is likely specific to thermal stress rather than a more generalized stress response. These findings provide initial mechanistic insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may also offer practical applications.
 The profusion of high-throughput instruments and the explosion of new results in the scientific literature  are both a blessing and a curse to the bench researcher . Even knowledgeable and experienced scientists can benefit from computational tools that help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving terrain . In this paper , we describe a novel computational approach to this challenge , a knowledge-based system that combines reading , reasoning , and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data . Reading methods extract information from external resources , either by parsing structured data or using biomedical language processing to extract information from unstructured data , and track knowledge provenance . Reasoning methods enrich the knowledge that results from reading by, for example , noting two genes that are annotated to the same ontology term or database entry . Reasoning is also used to combine all sources into a knowledge network that represents the integration of all sorts of relationships between a pair of genes , and to calculate a combined reliability score . Reporting methods combine the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualize the combined network in a tool that facilitates the knowledge-based analysis of that data . An implementation of this approach , called the Hanalyzer , is demonstrated on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development . The use of the tool was critical in the creation of hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development; each of these hypotheses was validated by further experimental work .
 We have used a combination of proteomics and lectin microarray analysis to characterize the surface proteins and glycoconjugates of two different types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica .  We found that the 15k EVs are released from the gut of the parasite, while the 120k EVs are released from the protonephridial system.  We also found that the surface proteins of both EVs are recognized by host antibodies, and that pre-treatment of EVs with host antibodies enhances their uptake by macrophages.  Our results provide a detailed characterization of the surface proteins and glycoconjugates of F. hepatica EVs, which may be useful for developing new therapeutic strategies to target these parasite-derived vesicles.
200-300 words. The precise regulation of microRNA (miRNA) transcription and processing is important for eukaryotic development. In plants, miRNAs are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II, then cleaved in the nucleus into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). We identified a cycling DOF transcription factor, CDF2, which interacts with DCL1 and regulates the accumulation of a population of miRNAs. CDF2 binds directly to the promoters of some miRNA genes and works as a transcription activator or repressor for these miRNA genes. CDF2 binds preferentially to the pri-miRNAs regulated by itself and affects DCL1-mediated processing of these pri-miRNAs. Genetically, CDF2 works in the same pathway as miR156 or miR172 to control flowering. We conclude that CDF2 regulates a group of pri-miRNAs at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels to maintain proper levels of their mature miRNAs to control plant development.
 The oocyte-granulosa cell communication is a crucial process for folliculogenesis, which is essential for female reproductive function. In this study, we found that oocyte geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a metabolic intermediate involved in protein geranylgeranylation, is required to establish the oocyte-granulosa cell communication. GGPP and Ggpps levels in oocytes increased during early follicular development. The selective depletion of GGPP in mouse oocytes impaired the proliferation of granulosa cells, primary-secondary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GGPP depletion inhibited Rho GTPase geranylgeranylation and its GTPase activity, which was responsible for the accumulation of cell junction proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm and the failure to maintain physical connection between oocyte and granulosa cells. GGPP ablation also blocked Rab27a geranylgeranylation, which might account for the impaired secretion of oocyte materials such as Gdf9. Our study provides the evidence that GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation contributes to the establishment of oocyte-granulosa cell communication and then regulates the primary-secondary follicle transition, a key phase of folliculogenesis essential for female reproductive function.
 The RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the messenger RNA using a DNA template . Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains elusive whether the “secondary channel” is the only route for NTP to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the “main channel” could be an alternative. In this study, we have built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simulations together with structural analysis to shed light on NTP entry pathways. Interestingly, we found that although both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on MD simulations with NTP loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the NTP through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription.
 Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is increasing in incidence and economic importance worldwide. However, it is generally believed that these numbers still represent a large underestimate of the actual disease burden. In most countries, reporting of dengue is based solely on clinical criteria, which complicates dengue disease surveillance. To overcome this problem, authors of several published dengue studies multiplied the number of reported cases by a set factor to obtain an estimate of actual cases. However, usually these multiplication factors (MFs) have been based on data derived from a single study, often performed in a different country, or based on “expert opinion.” In this study, the authors utilized laboratory-confirmed incidence of symptomatic DENV infection both in inpatients and outpatients identified in prospective cohort studies at three field sites in Thailand and Cambodia to estimate the magnitude of dengue underrecognition in these countries. The results indicate that non-hospitalized patients with dengue illness represent a substantial proportion of the overall disease burden. These data are crucial for the assessment of the economic impact of dengue and the cost-effectiveness of a potential dengue vaccine in the future.
 The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that work together to protect the body from infection and disease. Natural killer ( NK ) cells are a type of immune cell that can directly kill infected cells and help activate other immune cells. In this study, we used a mouse model to investigate how NK cells may help orchestrate global antiviral defense against cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ). We found that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against MCMV infection in vivo, and that this is achieved through the ability of NK cells to limit IFN-α/β production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through the early control of viral replication, which reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) and preserves the conventional dendritic cell ( cDC ) compartment. Our findings suggest that the ability of NK cells to respond very early to cytomegalovirus infection critically contributes to balance the intensity of other innate immune responses, which dampens early immunopathology and promotes optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Thus, the extent to which NK cell responses benefit the host goes beyond their direct antiviral effects and extends to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and to the promotion of adaptive immunity.
45S rRNA genes are arranged in tandem arrays in copy numbers ranging from several hundred to several thousand in plants . Although it is clear that not all copies are transcribed under normal growth conditions , the molecular basis controlling the expression of specific sets of rRNA genes remains unclear . Here , we report four major rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis thaliana . Interestingly , while transcription of one of these rRNA variants is induced , the others are either repressed or remain unaltered in A . thaliana plants with a disrupted nucleolin-like protein gene ( Atnuc-L1 ) . Remarkably , the most highly represented rRNA gene variant , which is inactive in WT plants , is reactivated in Atnuc-L1 mutants . We show that accumulated pre–rRNAs originate from RNA Pol I transcription and are processed accurately . Moreover , we show that disruption of the AtNUC-L1 gene induces loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone epigenetic marks at rRNA genes . Collectively , these data reveal a novel mechanism for rRNA gene transcriptional regulation in which the nucleolin protein plays a major role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis .
 Our study identifies the human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) protein pUL38 as a novel component of the NuRD complex, a multi-protein complex that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. We show that pUL38 interacts with HDAC1, a component of the NuRD complex, and that this interaction is required for efficient HCMV replication. We also show that pUL29/28, another HCMV protein, is necessary for the interaction between pUL38 and HDAC1. Our findings suggest that HCMV co-opts the NuRD complex to enhance expression of its immediate-early genes.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pneumonia in infants and children. In this study, the authors used whole genome-fragment phage display libraries (GFPDL) to map the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection and traced its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. They found that antibody responses to RSV-F and RSV-G proteins were different and that antibody responses to RSV-G declined significantly in adults. The authors identified several novel epitopes in RSV-F and G proteins and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. They also demonstrated an unlinked evolution of the antibody responses to F and G proteins in humans. These findings could help in the development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines, for RSV.
 Filariasis is a group of diseases caused by parasitic worms called filariae. These diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes and affect millions of people worldwide. The current treatment for filariasis is ineffective against adult worms, which are the source of transmission. Emodepside is a veterinary drug that has shown macrofilaricidal effects in filariae. In this study, we investigated the mode of action of emodepside in the adult worms of Brugia malayi, one of the species that causes filariasis. We found that emodepside targets SLO-1 K channels, which are more sensitive in male worms than in female worms. We also found that selectively knocking down the SLO-1A splice variant in female worms increased the efficacy of emodepside. These findings suggest that the sex of the filarial target is an important therapeutic variable to consider when evaluating a dose-regimen for treatments.
 Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) is a disabling and disfiguring disease caused by mosquito-borne, filarial (threadlike) parasitic worms. The Global Program to Eliminate LF ( GPELF ) has reduced the at-risk population for LF from 1.2 billion to 789 million (a 46% reduction) between 2000 and 2012 by providing repeated, annual rounds of anti-filarial medications by mass drug administration ( MDA ). However, LF elimination in Africa lags behind other endemic regions with only a 25% reduction. This is due in part to slow rollout of MDA in regions of central Africa co-endemic with Loa loa, because drugs used for MDA can cause severe adverse effects in people with loiasis. The GPELF strategy relies on point of care rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) to map regions endemic for LF and to determine when regions have successfully eliminated the disease. Two RDTs have been used to detect a circulating antigen of Wuchereria bancrofti, the filarial species that causes LF in Africa. These are the Binax NOW Filariasis immunochromatographic card test ( ICT ) and the Alere Filariasis Test Strip ( FTS ). The FTS is more stable, more sensitive, and less expensive than the ICT. Both are lateral flow assays that work as follows: whole blood is applied to a sample pad containing colloidal gold-conjugated polyclonal antifilarial antibodies. The sample pad retains blood cells, while capillary action pulls the serum across the test strip and over a test line containing an immobilized IgM class monoclonal antibody called AD12. The AD12 antibody binds a carbohydrate epitope that is abundantly present on a high molecular weight (200–250 kDa) W . bancrofti circulating filarial antigen ( CFA ). AD12 traps W . bancrofti CFA bound to the colloidal gold-labeled polyclonal antibodies to form a pink line that indicates a positive test result. The molecular structure and saccharide composition of the carbohydrate epitope recognized by the AD12 antibody is unknown. This carbohydrate moiety, which we refer to as the AD12 epitope, appears to be specific to nematodes and is not phosphorylcholine. A second IgM monoclonal antibody developed in the Weil laboratory, DH6 . 5, also recognizes the AD12 epitope. Like the AD12 carbohydrate epitope, the exact identity of the high molecular weight W . bancrofti CFA remains unknown. It is clear, however, that it contains multiple AD12 epitopes per molecule, since capture of the molecule by DH6 . 5 in an ELISA format does not prevent AD12 / DH6 . 5 from binding to the non-bound surface of the molecule. While other nematodes have antigens that contain the AD12 epitope, the ICT and FTS tests have been considered functionally specific for W . bancrofti infection, since until recently, such antigens had not been found circulating in the blood of persons with other infections. It has now become clear, however, that some persons with loiasis, especially those with high L . loa microfilaria ( Mf ) counts, have positive LF RDT results. This complicates mapping and monitoring for LF elimination programs in central Africa. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify filarial antigens in the blood of persons infected with L . loa that could cause false-positive LF RDT results. This information may lead to the development of improved diagnostic tests for both infections.
 We used RNA-Seq to identify new ciliary proteins in C . elegans . We found a unique expression profile for ciliary genes and confirmed that our clustering analysis identifies known ciliary proteins. We also discovered a novel conserved ciliary protein, RAB-28, which is expressed exclusively in ciliated cells and behaves as an IFT cargo via BBSome- and nucleotide binding-dependent mechanisms. Overexpression of predicted active or inactive forms of RAB-28 leads to variant-specific ciliary and cell non-autonomous sensory pore morphogenesis defects. Our work provides a novel approach to finding new ciliary proteins and uncovers a functional association between the BBSome, IFT, and the orthologue of the cone-rod dystrophy protein, RAB28.
 The brain is responsible for representing the outside world, but it can only rely on neural responses and has no independent access to external stimuli. In this study, we investigated how the brain may do this by using hippocampal place cells as a model system. We found that simply knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space. This may enable the brain to construct its own internal representations. We also found that the simple knowledge of which groups of hippocampal place cells fire together is enough to extract global topological features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space within which the animal's position can be tracked. This is made possible by using standard tools from algebraic topology and graph theory.
 We report here the nearly complete genomic sequence of 20 different individuals , determined using “next-generation” sequencing technologies . We use these data to characterize the type of genetic variation carried by humans in a sample of this size , which is to our knowledge the largest set of unrelated genomic sequences that have been reported . We summarize different categories of variation in each genome , and in total across all 20 of the genomes , finding a surprising number of variants predicted to reduce or remove the proteins encoded by many different genes . This work provides important fundamental information about the scope of human genetic variation , and suggests ways to further explore the relationship between these genetic variants and human disease .
Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are two species of hookworms that cause anemia and iron deficiency in children. The intensity of the infection is related to the severity of disease. The conventional method for determining infection load is done with a proxy marker, number of eggs, using Kato-Katz microscopy slides with a fixed amount of feces. However, this method is laborious and frequently omitted. Necator americanus is predominant in tropical environments, whereas Ancylostoma duodenale is adapted to colder and drier circumstances. Ancylostoma duodenale causes 2 to 10 times more blood loss per worm than Necator americanus. Multiplex real-time PCR is a powerful diagnostic tool for public health research to combat anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource poor settings. The objective of this study was to determine prevalence of the two hookworm species, infection load, and species association with severe anemia and bone marrow iron deficiency in pre-school Malawian children using a species-specific multiplex real-time PCR. The study found that Ancylostoma duodenale was more prevalent than Necator americanus and that Ancylostoma duodenale infection was significantly associated with severe anemia and bone marrow iron deficiency. The study recommends that quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections should be done to combat anemia and iron deficiency in children.
DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are harmful to cells and can lead to cancer if not repaired correctly . Two main pathways exist for repairing DSBs: homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) . HR is more accurate but requires an undamaged template, while NHEJ is faster but error-prone . In germ cells, HR is essential for repairing meiotic DSBs and creating crossovers ( COs ) that are necessary for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis . In C . elegans, germ cells have NHEJ activity, but it is efficiently inhibited . We found that COM-1, the C . elegans homolog of CtIP/Sae2/Ctp1, is crucial for inhibiting NHEJ and promoting HR in germ cells. COM-1 is not required for Spo11 removal or initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but it is needed to prevent chromosome aggregation and CO failure. COM-1 also acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at early pachytene stage. Our results reveal a dual role for COM-1 during meiosis: it blocks toxic NHEJ activity and guarantees timely formation of interhomolog COs.
 The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a disease that is common in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Melioidosis is a serious infection that can lead to sepsis and death. A goat model of aerosol infection with B. pseudomallei was used to study the humoral immune response. Antigenic protein profiling was generated from the infecting strain, and ELISA and western blot were used to analyze the immune response. The results showed that the humoral immune response was dominated by IgG antibodies, and that the most reactive antigen was the heat shock protein GroEL1. The study provides insight into the immune response to B. pseudomallei infection and may help identify immunogenic proteins for new diagnostics and vaccine candidates.
 Mitosis is a complex process that requires precise regulation of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity. The activation of cyclin B1–Cdk1 is triggered by a positive feedback loop at the end of G2 phase, which leads to mitotic entry. The activation of cyclin B1–Cdk1 is maintained by the inhibition of the APC/C complex, which prevents the degradation of cyclin B1. The dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and the phosphorylation of the Cdk1 target anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome 3 are used to determine the temporal development of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in single cells. The results show that cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity is maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. The study suggests that the development of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in vivo proceeds as if it were governed by bistability. The results explain how cyclin B1–Cdk1 can be responsible for cytoplasmic rearrangements even during nuclear translocation. The study proposes a model in which different thresholds of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity, in combination with a gradual increase in activity, help to coordinate early and late mitotic events.
 HIV-1 vaccines have failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies ( Nabs ) that are capable of protecting against globally diverse HIV-1 subtypes . One relevant setting to study the development of a strong, cross-reactive Nab response is HIV-1 superinfection ( SI ) , defined as sequential infections from different source partners . In this study, we examined the post-SI Nab responses from 21 Kenyan women collectively exposed to subtypes A , C , and D and superinfected after a median time of ~1 . 07 years following initial infection . Plasma samples chosen for analysis were collected at a median time point ~2 . 72 years post-SI . Using standard epitope mapping techniques that were applied to the previous cohorts , we focused on four main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope—the CD4-binding site , a V1/V2 glycan , the N332 supersite in V3 , and the membrane proximal external region of gp41 . Using computational sera delineation analyses, we found that 20 of the 21 superinfected women’s Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These data are consistent with a model in which SI with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, and thus would provide support for vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs.
β-herpesviruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are a major cause of birth defects and neurological disorders. HCMV infection has been shown to disrupt Notch signaling in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are essential for fetal brain development. Hes1, a downstream effector of Notch signaling, is a key regulator of NPC fate and differentiation. In this study, we found that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected NPCs. We also identified IE1, a viral immediate-early protein, as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates Hes1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which HCMV disrupts Notch signaling and NPC differentiation, which may contribute to the neurological disorders caused by HCMV infection.
 In this study, we compared gene expression and transcription factor binding in blastoderm embryos of four Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. We found that mRNA levels are much better conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and that changes in a gene's expression are poorly explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites, sites in regions bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding, suggesting that a considerable amount of transcription factor binding is weakly or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection. Our study provides insights into the evolution of gene expression and transcription factor binding in Drosophila.
The goal of the global programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) is to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020. The programme aims to achieve the goal by interrupting transmission through annual single dose mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole (fixed dose 400 mg) either with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC, 6 mg/kg body weight) or ivermectin (150–200 µg/kg) for at least 5–6 years. By 2010 the programme had made significant progress in 53 of the 72 endemic countries, delivering billions of treatments to nearly 897 million people in the world. In India, the programme was initiated on a pilot basis in 13 of the 250 endemic districts during 1996–97 with DEC alone and thereafter with DEC and albendazole. The programme has been gradually scaled up to reach all the 250 endemic districts spread over 20 states and union territories covering nearly 421 of the 590 million people at risk in 2007. The impact of the programme is monitored once in two years in each implementation unit (IU) by screening the population in at least one sentinel and one spot-checks sites for microfilaraemia (Mf) [2]. Several endemic countries reported that delivering 5–6 rounds of MDA reduced the prevalence of Mf and antigenaemia (Ag) in many IUs [3]. In India, it has been reported that in 192 of the 250 IUs Mf-prevalence has reached <1% – the recommended threshold for proceeding with further epidemiological assessment [3]. Such an assessment is required prior to making a decision to stop or continue MDA in these IUs. The WHO monitoring and evaluation guidelines (2005) required a multi-step process to be completed before MDA could be stopped [2]. The recommended sampling strategy for stopping MDA in an IU is to test (i) by a cluster design based lot quality assurance-cluster sampling (LQAS) of 10 young children (age-class depends on number of rounds of MDA) from each of 30-clusters (communities) for antigenaemia (Ag) status and (ii) if no positives are found, an additional LQAS of 3000 school entrants drawn from the entire IU for Ag-status. MDA has to be stopped if no Ag-positives are detected by (ii) . The above procedure is applicable only when (a) the Mf-prevalence is <1% in both sentinel and spot check sites (b) Mf-prevalence is <1% in 5–10 additional sites of high risk transmission, and (c) Ag is negative among children aged 2–4 years in all these sites. Although this rigorous process was designed to ensure that transmission was stopped with a high degree of probability, it was cumbersome. Therefore, the WHO has revised the guidelines in 2011 [4] and proposed transmission assessment surveys (TAS) for making decision to stop/continue MDA. As per the revised guidelines, the recommended Ag-threshold for TAS is a defined number of Ag-positive children (depends on the target population size) such that there is at least a 75% chance of stopping MDA if the true prevalence is less than 1.0% and no more than a 5% chance of stopping MDA (incorrectly) if the true prevalence is ≥2.0%. TAS are to be carried out in IUs that have completed at least five rounds of MDA, each with >65% coverage and with Mf-prevalence of <1% in both sentinel and spot check sites. However, both the old and the revised guidelines suggested cluster design for the LQAS, which is not based on empirical evidence about the distributions of infection at household and site level. We carried out a study to address the above mentioned issues in two primary health centres (PHC) in Thanjavur district, India, known to be endemic for filariasis caused by periodic Wuchereria bancrofti and transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus (National Vector Borne Disease Control programme, NVBDCP). A large proportion of the population of these two PHC areas, where eight rounds of MDA were completed, was screened for Mf and
 The systematic literature review found that temephos was effective at reducing entomological indices when applied as a single intervention. However, when applied in combination with other interventions, the effect was not sustained over time or failed to reduce immature stages. The community-effectiveness of temephos was dependent on factors such as quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental factors. Timing of temephos deployment and its need for reapplication, along with behavioural factors such as reluctance to apply it to drinking water, and operational aspects such as cost, supplies, time and labour were further limitations identified in this review. In conclusion, when applied as a single intervention, temephos was found to be effective at suppressing entomological indices, but there is no evidence to suggest that it is associated with reductions in dengue transmission.
 The cohesin complex is a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together from the time of their duplication in S phase until their separation during mitosis. In budding yeast, cohesin is most abundant at the centromere and surrounding region, the pericentromere. We show that the budding yeast Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor, Csm3, are both important mediators of pericentromeric cohesion, but they act through distinct mechanisms. We propose that the Ctf19 complex ensures additional loading of cohesin at centromeres prior to passage of the replication fork, thereby ensuring its incorporation into functional linkages through a process requiring Csm3. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms controlling endogenous stem cell pools that are likely to be relevant for modulating stem cell regenerative capabilities.
 Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a major public health concern, with an estimated 100 million infections occurring every year . The complex array of concurrent host physiologic changes has hampered a complete understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of dengue pathogenesis . We performed a systems level characterization of serum metabolome and lipidome of adult dengue fever ( DF ) patients at early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent stages of DENV infection using liquid chromatography- and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry . Sixty differential metabolites were identified in our metabolomics analysis and the main metabolite classes were free fatty acids , acylcarnitines , phospholipids , and amino acids . Major perturbed metabolic pathways included fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation , phospholipid catabolism , steroid hormone pathway , etc . Analysis of phospholipids and sphingolipids verified the temporal trends and revealed association with lymphocytes and platelets numbers . These metabolites were significantly perturbed during the early stages , and normalized to control levels at convalescent stage , suggesting their potential utility as prognostic markers . DENV infection causes temporally distinct serum metabolome and lipidome changes , and many of the differential metabolites are involved in acute inflammatory responses . Our global analyses revealed early anti-inflammatory responses working in concert to modulate early pro-inflammatory processes , thus preventing the host from development of pathologies by excessive or prolonged inflammation . This study is the first example of how an omic- approach can divulge the extensive , concurrent , and dynamic host responses elicited by DENV and offers plausible physiological insights to why DF is self-limiting .
 We have analysed research on Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) published between 2002 and 2012 to identify and map NTD research networks in Germany and their partners abroad. We found that the majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil, while collaborations with partners on the African continent remained scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions. We identified strong performers on an individual level by using classic parameters ( number of publications , h-index ) and social network analysis parameters ( betweenness centrality ). The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases. The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. This finding underlines the need to identify barriers and expand Germany’s otherwise strong research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators that are used to identify opportunities for collaboration. Using free tools to analyse research processes and output could facilitate data-driven health policies. Our findings contribute to the prioritisation of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.
 Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) and soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) have been targeted since 2000 in Haiti, with a strong mass drug administration ( MDA ) program led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population and its collaborating international partners. By 2012, Haiti’s neglected tropical disease ( NTD ) program had reached full national scale, and with such consistently good epidemiological coverage that it is now able to stop treatment for LF throughout almost all of the country. Essential to this success have been in the detail of how MDAs were implemented, including ensuring strong community awareness through an evidence-based, multi-channel communication and education campaign facilitated by voluntary drug distributors; strengthening community trust of the drug distributors by ensuring that respected community members were recruited and received appropriate training, supervision, identification, and motivation; enforcing a “directly observed treatment” strategy; providing easy access to treatment through numerous distribution posts and a strong drug supply chain; and ensuring quality data collection that was used to guide and inform MDA strategies. The evidence that these strategies were effective lies in both the high treatment coverage obtained and the significant reduction in burden of infection. By taking advantage of sustained international financial and technical support, especially during the past eight years, Haiti’s very successful MDA campaign resulted in steady progress toward LF elimination and development of a strong foundation for ongoing STH control. These efforts, as described, have not only helped establish the global portfolio of “best practices” for NTD control but also are poised to help solve two of the most important future NTD challenges—how to maintain control of STH infections after the community-based LF “treatment platform” ceases and how to ensure appropriate morbidity management for patients currently suffering from lymphatic filarial disease.
 The alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti can form a symbiotic relationship with legume plants, in which it differentiates into enlarged, polyploid bacteroids within host cells. The cell cycle of S . meliloti is tightly regulated by the master regulator CtrA, which is essential for cellular differentiation during symbiosis. In this study, we investigated the regulation and function of CtrA in S . meliloti. We found that CtrA regulates similar processes as in Caulobacter crescentus, but through different target genes. For example, CtrA does not control the timing of cell division during the cell cycle, but instead it negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system. Our findings provide valuable insight into how highly conserved genetic networks can evolve to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria.
 Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium that causes the disease tularemia. It is able to survive and replicate inside macrophages, which is critical for its virulence. By screening a bank of HimarFT transposon mutants of the F . tularensis live vaccine strain ( LVS ) to isolate intracellular growth-deficient mutants, we selected one mutant in a gene encoding a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ). This gene ( FTL_0766 ) was hence designated ggt . The mutant strain showed impaired intracellular multiplication and was strongly attenuated for virulence in mice. Here we present evidence that the GGT activity of F . tularensis allows utilization of glutathione ( GSH , γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine ) and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as cysteine sources to ensure intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the essential role of a nutrient acquisition system in the intracellular multiplication of F . tularensis . GSH is the most abundant source of cysteine in the host cytosol. Thus, the capacity this intracellular bacterial pathogen has evolved to utilize the available GSH , as a source of cysteine in the host cytosol, constitutes a paradigm of bacteria–host adaptation.
 We present a study on the ability of Leishmania parasites to fuse with each other in the same parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in infected mammalian cells. We found that Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes, which lodge in large PVs, do not fuse with L. major amastigotes, which lodge in small PVs. However, L. major promastigotes, which are extracellular, can fuse with L. amazonensis PVs. In these chimeric vacuoles, L. major promastigotes remain motile and multiply, but do not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, in doubly infected cells, within their own, unfused PVs, L. major promastigotes differentiate into amastigotes. The results suggest that PVs customized by different Leishmania species differ in their ability to fuse with each other. Additionally, a species-specific PV was required for L. major destruction or differentiation. The observations reported in this paper should be useful in further studies of the interactions between PVs of different Leishmania species and of the mechanisms involved in the recognition and fusion of PVs.
 In this study, the authors investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed JR-FL Env trimers to elicit neutralizing antibodies ( nAbs ). Unusually potent nAb titers developed in 2 of 8 rabbits immunized with virus-like particles ( VLPs ) expressing trimers ( trimer VLP sera ) and in 1 of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost ( DNA trimer sera ). All 3 sera neutralized via quaternary epitopes and exploited natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of JR-FL gp120. Specifically, trimer VLP sera took advantage of the unusual absence of a glycan at residue 197 ( present in 98.7% of Envs ) . Intriguingly, removing the N197 glycan ( with no loss of tier 2 phenotype ) rendered 50% or 16.7% ( n = 18 ) of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to the two trimer VLP sera, showing broad neutralization via the surface masked by the N197 glycan. The neutralizing DNA trimer serum took advantage of the absence of a glycan at residue 230, also proximal to the CD4 binding site. Taken together, the data show for the first time that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes. Moreover, cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan. Overall, the observations provide new insights that may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.
 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a necrotizing skin disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans . It is primarily affecting the subcutaneous tissue and can lead to extensive tissue destruction and ulceration if left untreated . The currently recommended treatment consists of daily administration of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin for 8 weeks under regular supervision . However , many BU patients tend to report late to the treatment centers and therefore often with very extensive and severe lesions . Long recovery periods are common and in the case of large lesions skin transplantation is required and permanent morbidities including functional limitations may be observed . While mycolactone causes massive local immune suppression in active BU lesions , vigorous local immune responses are observed during anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy. However , it is difficult to differentiate between deterioration resulting from a local immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and deterioration resulting from other causes such as disturbed orchestration of wound healing processes or secondary infections. Wound healing is a complex process consisting of four overlapping and integrated phases: rapid homeostasis , inflammation , proliferation and tissue remodeling . We have analyzed markers of cell activation, myofibroblast formation and matrix deposition in tissue biopsies from BU lesions before, during and after treatment. Our results suggest that the healing process is severely delayed in some patients and that this may be associated with disturbed orchestration of wound healing processes. Our findings may help to better understand the pathogenesis of BU and to develop new therapeutic strategies for this disease.
 The human brain is a complex organ that is responsible for controlling the body's functions. It is composed of billions of neurons that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. The electrical signals are transmitted through the axons, which are long, slender projections that extend from the cell body of the neuron to the synapse. The chemical signals are transmitted through neurotransmitters, which are released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft, where they bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. The study of the brain and its functions is known as neuroscience. Neuroscience is a rapidly growing field that is constantly evolving as new technologies and techniques are developed. Some of the current areas of research in neuroscience include the study of neural networks, the effects of drugs on the brain, the development of new therapies for neurological disorders, and the study of the neural basis of behavior.
 Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis ( SCT ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions and short stature. The disease is caused by loss of function mutations in Filamin B ( FLNB ), a protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to signaling systems. In this study, the authors used a Flnb knockout mouse model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying SCT. They found that Flnb–/–mice exhibit rapid and progressive degeneration of the intervertebral discs ( IVDs ) during postnatal development, resulting in abnormal cell fate changes in the annulus fibrosus ( AF ) . The authors show that Flnb–/–mice exhibit increased TGFβ and BMP signaling, leading to ectopic differentiation of the AF cells into chondrocytes. These findings suggest that FLNB is involved in attenuating TGFβ/BMP signaling and influences AF cell fate. The authors propose that FLNB plays a critical role in the regulation of TGFβ/BMP signaling and AF cell fate, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCT.
 The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that work together to protect the body from infection and disease. One of the key components of the immune system is the transcription factor IRF3, which is involved in the production of interferon-beta (IFN-β), a protein that helps to fight off viral infections. However, some viruses have evolved mechanisms to target and inhibit IRF3, which can lead to increased viral replication and reduced immune responses. In this study, the authors investigate how the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV) targets and inhibits IRF3. They found that THOV's matrix protein long (ML) binds to a protein called TFIIB, which is involved in the initiation of transcription. This binding leads to the depletion of TFIIB from the nucleus, which in turn impairs the expression of IRF3 and other genes involved in the immune response. The authors suggest that targeting TFIIB may be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation.
 Human parvovirus B19 ( B19V ) infection of primary human erythroid progenitor cells ( EPCs ) arrests infected cells at both late S-phase and G2-phase , which contain 4N DNA . B19V infection induces a DNA damage response ( DDR ) that facilitates viral DNA replication but is dispensable for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase; however , a putative C-terminal transactivation domain ( TAD2 ) within NS1 is responsible for G2-phase arrest . To fully understand the mechanism underlying B19V NS1-induced G2-phase arrest , we established two doxycycline-inducible B19V-permissive UT7/Epo-S1 cell lines that express NS1 or NS1mTAD2 , and examined the function of the TAD2 domain during G2-phase arrest . The results confirm that the NS1 TAD2 domain plays a pivotal role in NS1-induced G2-phase arrest . Mechanistically , NS1 transactivated cellular gene expression through the TAD2 domain , which was itself responsible for ATR ( ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related ) activation . Activated ATR phosphorylated CDC25C at serine 216 , which in turn inactivated the cyclin B/CDK1 complex without affecting nuclear import of the complex . Importantly , we found that the ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway was activated during B19V infection of EPCs , and that ATR activation played an important role in B19V infection-induced G2-phase arrest .
 Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a spectrum of diseases ranging from uncomplicated dengue to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome ( DHF/DSS ) . DENV NS1 is a non-structural protein that is released into the extracellular milieu during infection and has been shown to induce endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro and vascular leak in vivo . In this study, the authors examined the relative contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways to DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. They found that DENV NS1 triggers hyperpermeability independently of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, and that this effect is specific to DENV NS1 and independent of TLR4 and TNF-α signaling. The authors also demonstrated that DENV NS1-induced endothelial dysfunction is dependent on endothelial sialidases, cathepsin L, and heparanase both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that DENV NS1 acts directly on the endothelium to induce vascular leak in vivo that is dependent on components of the glycocalyx.
 In this study, the authors investigate the role of the septin ring in the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) in budding yeast. The septin ring is a scaffold that forms at the bud neck during cytokinesis and is important for proper spindle positioning. The authors show that the redundant ubiquitin-ligases Dma1 and Dma2 are important for septin ring stability and the SPOC. They also show that the kinase Elm1 is important for the SPOC and that it is recruited to the bud neck by the septin ring. The authors show that constitutive recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck is sufficient to rescue the SPOC defects in dma1Δ dma2Δ mutant cells. Overall, the study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the SPOC and the role of the septin ring in this process.
 In this study, we used worldwide allele frequency data to scan the human genome for selection signals by identifying SNPs with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate across 61 worldwide populations. We found a striking enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those that are strongly correlated with climate variables. Among the most extreme signals, several overlap with those from GWAS, including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we found an enrichment of strong signals in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection and immunity, and cancer. Our results imply that adaptations to climate shaped the spatial distribution of variation in humans.
 The short QT syndrome ( SQTS ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death . The N588K mutation in the KCNH2 gene, which encodes the hERG potassium channel, is a common variant in SQTS patients . This mutation leads to a markedly increased hERG current during both ventricular and atrial action potential repolarization . However, the functional consequences of this mutation on the QT interval and arrhythmogenesis are not well understood. In this study, we used Markov chain models to simulate the effects of the N588K mutation on the hERG current and its contribution to the repolarization of the ventricular action potential. We found that the N588K mutation led to a markedly increased hERG current during both ventricular and atrial action potential repolarization. This increased hERG current led to a shortening of the QT interval and an increased susceptibility to re-entrant arrhythmia. Our study provides a clear link between the kinetic changes to the hERG current in SQTS and altered ventricular tissue electrophysiology that favors re-entrant arrhythmia in this form of the SQTS.
 We present a deep attention network that can simultaneously predict and understand collective behavior in large groups of animals. The model is organized in modules that allow for insight into the underlying interaction rule and the number of interacting neighbors. We tested the model using simulated trajectories and experimental trajectories of large groups of zebrafish. The model accurately predicts the interaction rule and the number of interacting neighbors in ground-truth data generated by agents following mathematical rules. The model also shows that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbors. The weights are higher for neighbors that are close, in a collision path, or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. The model also extracts that the number of interacting individuals is dynamical and typically in the range of 8–22, with 1–10 more important ones. Our results suggest that each animal decides by dynamically selecting information from the collective.
 The emergence and spread of drug-resistant HIV is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment . Around 10% of ART-naïve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV type 1 . Hence it is important to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution . Thanks to routinely performed drug resistance tests , HIV sequence data is increasingly available and can be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among viral lineages . In this study we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort . The viral phylogeny reflects the transmission tree , which we model using stochastic birth–death-sampling processes with two types: hosts infected by a sensitive or resistant strain . This allows quantification of fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug sensitive strains . The resistance mutations 41L , 67N , 70R , 184V , 210W , 215D , 215S and 219Q ( nRTI-related ) and 103N , 108I , 138A , 181C , 190A ( NNRTI-related ) in the reverse trancriptase and the 90M mutation in the protease gene are included in this study . Among the considered resistance mutations , only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains . The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N , 70R , 184V , 219Q . The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations included in this study all included 1 , suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort . These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations . Overall , we have developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations .
 The Elongator complex is a multi-component complex that plays a role in chromatin remodeling and tRNA modification. In fission yeast, the Sin3/Elp3 component of the Elongator complex is important for oxidative stress survival. The stress transcriptional program is affected in mutant cells, but not severely. On the contrary, cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 cannot modify the uridine wobble nucleoside of certain tRNAs, and other tRNA modifying activities such as Ctu1-Ctu2 are also essential for normal tolerance to H2O2. A plasmid over-expressing the tRNALysUUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3/Elp3 mutant cells. Our study demonstrates that the lack of a functional Elongator complex results in stress phenotypes due to its contribution to tRNA modification and subsequent translation inefficiency of certain stress-induced, highly expressed mRNAs. These results suggest that the transcriptional defects of these strain backgrounds may be a secondary consequence of the deficient expression of a transcription factor and other components of the transcriptional machinery.
 Nef is a protein that helps HIV-1 replicate and spread. In this study, we found that Nef can protect HIV-1 from neutralizing antibodies that target a specific part of the virus called the membrane proximal external region (MPER). This protection is not due to Nef increasing the amount of virus-associated Env, but rather to Nef altering the way that Env is recognized by the antibodies. This finding has important implications for understanding how HIV-1 evades the immune system and causes disease.
 Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a type of cancer that affects the bile ducts and is caused by the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini. The snail Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos is the intermediate host of O. viverrini. In this study, the authors used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to analyze the transcriptomes of uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos. They identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 43 distinct biological pathways, including pathways associated with immune defense mechanisms against parasites. Amongst the DEGs with immune functions, transcripts encoding distinct proteases displayed the highest down-regulation in Bithynia specimens infected by O. viverrini, while transcription of genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins was significantly up-regulated in parasite-infected snails when compared to the uninfected counterparts. The authors suggest that these findings provide a foundation for functional studies of genes and gene products potentially involved in immune-molecular mechanisms implicated in the ability of the parasite to successfully colonize its snail intermediate host. The annotated dataset provided herein represents a ready-to-use molecular resource for the discovery of molecular pathways underlying susceptibility and resistance mechanisms of B. siamensis goniomphalos to O. viverrini and for comparative analyses with pulmonate snail intermediate hosts of other platyhelminths including schistosomes.
 Complement receptor 1 ( CR1 ) is a key player in the complement system, which is involved in the immune response to pathogens.  CR1 is a receptor for C3b/C4b fragments deposited on mycobacteria, which mediate their entrance into macrophages.  In this study, we investigated the role of CR1 polymorphisms in leprosy susceptibility.  We found that individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs3849266*T in intron 21 and rs3737002*T in exon 26 presented twice higher susceptibility to leprosy.  Paucibacillary patients with these variants presented lower sCR1 levels, thus reducing the anti-inflammatory response.  Furthermore, the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form and presented the intronic rs12034383*G allele, which was associated with higher gene expression.  There was an inverse correlation between the levels of sCR1 and mannose-binding lectin ( initiator molecule of the lectin pathway of complement, recognized by CR1 ).  These results suggest a regulatory role for CR1 polymorphisms on mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy.
 Metabolomics is a powerful tool to analyze biological states on the molecular level. It can help to understand the contribution and complex interaction of genes, proteins, and metabolites in health and disease. Recent studies have shown that genetic variants in metabolism-related genes can lead to specific and clearly differentiated metabolic phenotypes. However, many published studies did not analyze their data stratified by sex, although there is a strong correlation between sex and the incidence, prevalence, age at onset, symptoms, and severity of a disease, as well as the reaction to drugs. In this study, we systematically assessed the effect of sex on serum metabolites in a large population-based cohort. We also investigated whether there are sex-specific differences in the genetic determination of metabotypes. Our study provides new important insights into sex-specific differences of cell regulatory processes and underscores that studies should consider sex-specific effects in design and interpretation.
 Metabolic networks are used to model the interactions between different molecules in a cell. However, the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large, and optimization-based approaches are often necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function to be used in such optimization algorithms is directly linked with the biological hypothesis underlying the model and therefore it is one of the most relevant parameters for successful modeling. We show that the resulting optimization problem is sensitive towards stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network. We propose a new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance ( MiMBl ), which decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions, by casting objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks, we demonstrate that the use of stoichiometry representation independent algorithms is fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. We apply MiMBl to elucidate the mechanistic basis of several genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
 Plague is a highly virulent and re-emerging disease that primarily affects rodents and their flea vectors. We investigated the relationship between plague distribution and the population genetic structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. We conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure (15 microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, each covering about 150–200 km2 within the Madagascan plague focus. The seroprevalence levels in the rat populations mimicked those previously reported for humans. As expected, rat populations clearly displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differs between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not related everywhere to the effective dispersal of rats. Genetic diversity estimates suggested that plague epizootics had only a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir. Human social activities may also be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations.
 Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. The heptalaminate-covered, syncytial tegument is an important anatomical adaptation that enables schistosome parasites to maintain long-term, intravascular residence in definitive hosts. Recent studies have revealed a number of novel tegumental surface proteins, including three (SmCD59a, SmCD59b, and Sm29) containing uPAR/Ly6 domains. While vaccination with SmLy6A (SmCD59a) and SmLy6D (Sm29) induces protective immunity in experimental models, human immunoglobulin responses to representative SmLy6 family members have yet to be thoroughly explored. Using a PSI-BLAST-based search, we present a comprehensive reanalysis of the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family (SmLy6A-K) and provide strong evidence that the previously identified vaccine candidate SmLy6D (Sm29) is a unique double uPAR/Ly6 domain-containing representative. To provide evidence that SmLy6 members are immunogenic in human populations, we report IgG1 (as well as IgG4 and IgE) responses against two surface-bound representatives (SmLy6A and SmLy6B) within a cohort of S. mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after praziquantel treatment. While pre-treatment IgG1 prevalence for SmLy6A and SmLy6B differs amongst the studied population (7.4% and 25.3% of the cohort, respectively), these values are both higher than IgG1 prevalence (2.7%) for a sub-surface tegumental antigen, SmTAL1. Further, post-treatment IgG1 levels against surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B significantly drop (p = 0.020 and p < 0.001, respectively) when compared to rising IgG1 levels against sub-surface SmTAL1. Collectively, these results expand the number of SmLy6 proteins found within S. mansoni and specifically demonstrate that surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities.
The Drosophila retina is a complex tissue with a highly organized structure. The tissue is composed of many repeating units called ommatidia, which are made up of many different types of cells. The cells in the retina express two types of cell-cell adhesion molecules: E-cadherin and N-cadherin. N-cadherin is only expressed by four types of cells called cone cells, which are located at the center of each ommatidium. The authors of this study have developed a computer simulation that models the epithelial tissue in the Drosophila retina. The simulation takes into account the global interfacial energy between cells and how it is minimized. The authors found that the simulation can reproduce the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, distinguish features of cadherin dynamics, and emphasize the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. The authors also found that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, thereby modulating adhesion strengths between cells.
 The matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) MT1-MMP is a protein that helps cancer cells invade by breaking down the surrounding tissue. In this study, the authors used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments to measure the turnover rate of MT1-MMP at a single invadopodium, a specialized membrane protrusion that helps cancer cells invade. They found that the turnover rate of MT1-MMP was very rapid, with time constants of 26 seconds and 259 seconds. They then used computer simulations to analyze the role of the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP in ECM degradation at invadopodia. They found that inhibiting the turnover of MT1-MMP significantly reduced ECM degradation, both in their simulations and in their experiments. They also found that the degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in the turnover rate of MT1-MMP. Their computational model provides a new tool for designing and evaluating intervention strategies in cancer cell invasion.
 HIV-1 drug resistance is a major public health concern, and understanding how it emerges and spreads within an individual is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies. However, previous studies have found conflicting results about how HIV-1 in the blood differs from virus sampled in tissues, and whether HIV-1 throughout the body is homogeneously distributed. To directly measure how drug resistance spreads within a host and assess how spatial structure impacts its emergence, we examined serial sequences from four macaques infected with RT-SHIVmne027, a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and treated with RT inhibitors. Both viral DNA and RNA (vDNA and vRNA) were isolated from the blood (including plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells), lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at a median of four time points, and RT was characterized via single-genome sequencing. The resulting sequences reveal a dynamic system in which vRNA rapidly acquires drug resistance concomitantly across compartments through multiple independent mutations. Fast migration results in the same viral genotypes present across compartments, but not so fast as to equilibrate their frequencies immediately. The blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized rarely, while both the blood and lymph node were more frequently different from mucosal tissues. This study suggests that even oft-sampled blood does not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut where vRNA turnover was faster than the plasma and vDNA retained fewer wild-type viruses than other sampled compartments. Our findings of transient compartmentalization across multiple tissues may help explain the varied results of previous compartmentalization studies in HIV-1.
The study of how tissues grow and develop has been a topic of interest for many years. However, the role of diffusible molecules in this process is not well understood. In this study, the authors used mathematical modeling to show that a particular feedback architecture in which both positive and negative diffusible signals act on stem and/or progenitor cells leads to the appearance of bistable or bi-modal growth behaviors, ultrasensitivity to external growth cues, local growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and the triggering of self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise not through regulation of cell cycle speeds, but through the control of stem or progenitor self-renewal. Even though the spatial patterns that arise in this setting are the result of interactions between diffusible factors with antagonistic effects, morphogenesis is not the consequence of Turing-type instabilities. The authors identify a different mechanism by which diffusible signals can drive morphogenesis—not one based on creating patterns that act upstream of tissue growth or cell movement, but on regulating cell lineage progression, so that patterns arise directly out of tissue growth and cell displacement. The basis of this mechanism is the production of diffusible molecules by differentiated cells that act upon stem or progenitor cells to decrease the probability of self-renewal and increase the probability of differentiation. This feedback causes stem cell populations to automatically coordinate their behaviors so that net renewal is maintained at exactly 50%, the value required for homeostasis. During development, the regulation of tissue and organ growth is less a matter of achieving homeostasis than of efficiently arriving at a correct final size and shape (i.e., morphogenesis). The authors show that feedback molecules such as GDF8, GDF11, myostatin, and other renewal-inhibiting factors are often highly expressed during development. Interestingly, such molecules are often co-expressed with other diffusible molecules that have exactly the opposite effect on stem and progenitor cells—promoting renewal at the expense of differentiation. The authors mathematically define the conditions required for underlying phenomena such as bistability, ultrasensitivity, and spatial self-organization to arise in such systems, and show how they can be used to drive the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds, and fingers (the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis). They further show that even though such phenomena arise out of the opposing interactions of diffusible factors, the patterns that arise are not Turing patterns. Rather, pattern formation is driven by the coupling between tissue growth and the inherent ultrasensitivity of the underlying system, and not by intrinsic differences in the spatial ranges of action of diffusible positive and negative signals.
 Myopia is a common eye disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The etiology of myopia is complex and not fully understood. In this study, the authors conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on myopia in Europeans, involving 45,771 participants. They performed a survival analysis on age of myopia onset and identified 22 significant associations. These associations explain 2.9% of the variance in myopia age of onset and point towards a number of different mechanisms behind the development of myopia. The authors suggest that complex interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina may underlie the development of myopia in humans.
The lamprey is a primitive fish that has been used as a model organism for studying the neural mechanisms of swimming. In this study, we developed a computational model of the lamprey's central pattern generator (CPG) and the sensory feedback it receives from its body. We found that the type of sensory feedback the CPG receives can have a significant effect on the swimming kinematics and energetics of the lamprey. Specifically, we found that directional feedback, which provides information about the direction of the body's curvature, can alter the duty cycle of muscle activation, while magnitude feedback, which provides information about the magnitude of the body's curvature, can alter the frequency of the activation cycle. These effects can have complex interactions in the full integrated model, leading to changes in swimming performance.
 The global HIV pandemic is characterized by compartmentalized epidemics dominated by a single subtype, indicating strong founder effects. We hypothesized that the competition of viral strains at the epidemic level involves an advantage of the resident strain that was the first to colonize a population. We developed a stochastic modelling framework to simulate HIV epidemics over dynamic contact networks. We simulated epidemics in which the second strain was introduced into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state epidemic, and assessed whether the second strain was able to spread in the population. Simulations were parameterized based on empirical data; we tested scenarios with varying levels of overall prevalence. The spread of the second strain occurred on a much slower time scale compared with the initial expansion of the first strain. With strains of equal transmission efficiency, the second strain was unable to invade on a time scale relevant for the history of the HIV pandemic. To become dominant over a time scale of decades, the second strain needed considerable (>25%) advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. The inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase. We also tested how possible mechanisms of interference (inhibition of superinfection, depletion of highly connected hubs in the network, one-time acute peak of infectiousness) contribute to the inhibition effect. Our simulations confirmed a strong first comer advantage in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and may influence the future evolution of the pandemic.
 The organization of muscle is a product of functional adaptation over several length scales, spanning from the sarcomere to the muscle bundle. We hypothesized that boundary conditions in the extracellular space potentiate the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for directed sarcomeregenesis. We developed a quantitative model of how the cytoskeleton of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes organizes with respect to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. Numerical results and in vitro assays to control myocyte shape indicated that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from two temporally-ordered, organizational processes: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulate the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton and that a positive feedback loop is responsible for initiating the break in symmetry, potentiated by extracellular boundary conditions, is required to polarize the contractile cytoskeleton. We developed a novel method for micropatterning on soft substrates and were able to engineer myocyte shape on substrates that would allow us to measure the contractility of these artificial shapes and compare them with the model results. Together, these results suggest that the self-assembly and -organization of the contractile apparatus is facilitated by a symmetry-breaking event that is potentiated by either a geometric cue in the extracellular space or a random event in the intracellular space.
 The Wolbachia bacterium is being used as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission in several countries. The wMel strain of Wolbachia causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, high maternal transmission, and has no detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. We performed mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. We characterized the mosquito populations in relation to the socio-demographic conditions at these sites and at three other future release areas. We then constructed mathematical models using both the laboratory and field data and used these to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. We predict successful invasion at all five field sites, however the conditions by which this occurs vary greatly between sites, and are strongly influenced by the size of the local mosquito population. Through analysis of laboratory, field, and mathematical data, we show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place.
 In this study, the authors identified a JmjC domain-containing protein, JMJ703, in rice that specifically reverses all three forms of H3K4me in vitro and in vivo. Loss-of-function mutation of the gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant. Analysis of the crystal structure of the catalytic core domain ( c-JMJ703 ) of the protein revealed a general structural similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD2 proteins that are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However, several specific features were observed in the structure of c-JMJ703. Key residues that interact with cofactors Fe ( II ) and N-oxalylglycine and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide were identified and were shown to be essential for the demethylase activity in vivo. Several key residues are specifically conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of H3K4 demethylation and its role in plant development and stress adaptation.
 HIV-1 is a complex virus that requires multiple host cell factors for its replication. These factors interact with the viral capsid, which is composed of hexamers of the protein CA. We have identified a new interface on the CA hexamer that is critical for the binding of several host cell factors, including CPSF6, NUP153, PF74, and BI-2. This interface is formed by a loop in the N-terminal domain of CA that is shared by all four factors. Mutations in this loop disrupt the binding of all four factors to CA, and also affect the integration site selection and reverse transcription of HIV-1. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the interactions between the viral capsid and host cell factors, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for HIV-1.
 The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a vector of important human arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. Its large genome contains many repetitive sequences, which has resulted in a poorly assembled genome. To improve the genome assembly, we used a large number of SNPs from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti to generate a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were found on the same scaffold. Once these were corrected, we were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome. We found that there are very large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres, which can extend to as much as 47% of the chromosome. To illustrate the utility of this new genome assembly, we mapped a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi, and generated a list of candidate genes that could be affecting the trait. , Keyword: ['mosquito genome', 'genome assembly', 'genetic map', 'dengue virus', 'yellow fever virus', 'chikungunya virus', 'Aedes aegypti', 'genome organization', 'recombination', 'centromere', 'Brugia malayi', 'resistance gene', 'candidate genes']
 The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major target of vector control programs in tropical countries. Most mosquito surveillance programs are based on traditional household larval surveys, despite the availability of new trapping devices. We report the results of a multicentric entomological survey using four types of traps, besides the larval survey, to compare the entomological indices generated by these different surveillance tools in terms of their sensitivity to detect mosquito density variation. The study was conducted in five mid-sized cities, representing variations of tropical climate regimens. Surveillance schemes using traps for adults (BG-Sentinel, Adultrap and MosquiTRAP) or eggs (ovitraps) were applied monthly to three 1 km2 areas per city. Simultaneously, larval surveys were performed. Trap positivity and density indices in each area were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to characterize the seasonal pattern of mosquito infestation in all cities, as measured by each of the four traps. The House Index was consistently low in most cities, with median always 0. The traps rarely produced null indices, pointing to their greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of Ae. aegypti in comparison to the larval survey. Trap positivity indices tend to plateau at high mosquito densities. Despite this, both indices, positivity and density, agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality associated preferentially with temperature than with precipitation even in areas where temperature variation is small. All investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring the seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. Choice between traps should further consider differences of cost and ease-of-use.
σV is an extra-cytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor that is activated in response to lysozyme, an innate immune defense enzyme. The anti-σ factor RsiV is the sensor for σV activation. RsiV binds to lysozyme and this binding is required for σV activation. The site-1 protease required for RsiV degradation is signal peptidase. The anti-σ factor RsiV directly binds lysozyme and muramidase activity is not required for σV activation. The binding of lysozyme to RsiV activates RsiV for site-1 cleavage at site-1, initiating proteolytic destruction of RsiV and activation of σV. This suggests a novel mechanism in which the conformational change in a substrate controls the cleavage susceptibility for signal peptidase. Thus, unlike other ECF σ factors which require regulated intramembrane proteolysis for activation, the sensor for σV activation is not the site-1 protease but the anti-σ factor.
 In this study, the authors used a combination of linkage analysis and DNA sequencing to identify the genetic variants responsible for variation in a quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) in Drosophila melanogaster . The QTL in question, bab , is responsible for variation in cuticular pigmentation in female flies. The authors found that the bab locus contains two anciently duplicated paralogs, bab1 and bab2 , which are involved in patterning the adult abdomen , legs , and ovaries . By sequencing the bab locus from 96 D . melanogaster lines, the authors identified 148 kb of DNA sequence variation that is responsible for variation in cuticular pigmentation. They found that this variation is distributed across three functional regions: a promoter , a tissue-specific enhancer , and a Polycomb response element . The authors also found that natural bab alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation reflect a cumulative impact of polymorphisms that affect these three functional regions. These findings have important implications for basic and medical genomics , as they provide a detailed understanding of the genetic basis of a quantitative trait locus and the molecular mechanisms that underlie it.
 Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcus ) is a common cause of invasive and mucosal disease in humans despite widespread use of antibiotics and vaccines. The resilience of pneumococcus is due to its ability to adapt through the uptake and incorporation of new genetic material from the surrounding microbial community. DNA uptake and recombination are controlled by a tightly regulated quorum sensing system that is triggered by the extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide ( CSP ). In this study, we demonstrate that CSP can stimulate the production of a diverse array of blp bacteriocins. This cross stimulation occurs through increased production and secretion of the bacteriocin pheromone, BlpC, and requires a functional competence regulatory system. We show that a highly conserved motif in the promoter of the operon encoding BlpC and its transporter mediates the upregulation by CSP. Using biofilm-grown organisms as a model for competition and genetic exchange on the mucosal surface, we demonstrate that DNA exchange is enhanced by bacteriocin secretion, suggesting that co-stimulation of bacteriocins with competence provides an adaptive advantage. The blp and com regulatory pathways are believed to have diverged and specialized in a remote ancestor of pneumococcus. Despite this, the two systems have maintained a regulatory connection that promotes competition and adaptation by targeting for lysis a wide array of potential competitors while simultaneously providing the means for incorporation of their DNA.
 Poliovirus IRES-mediated translation requires the functions of certain canonical as well as non-canonical factors for the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA. The interaction of cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20 in extracts from poliovirus-infected cells has been previously described, and these two proteins were shown to function synergistically in viral translation. To further define the mechanism of ribosome recruitment for the initiation of poliovirus IRES-dependent translation, we focused on the role of the interaction between cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20. Our data presented implicate the presence of these two proteins in viral translation initiation complexes. In extracts from poliovirus-infected cells, SRp20 is associated with PCBP2 bound to poliovirus RNA, indicating that this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. Finally, we generated a mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition motif ( SRp20ΔRRM ) and found that this protein is localized similar to the full length SRp20, and also partially co-localizes with PCBP2 during poliovirus infection. Expression of this mutated version of SRp20 results in a ∼100 fold decrease in virus yield for poliovirus when compared to expression of wild type SRp20, possibly via a dominant negative effect. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which SRp20 interacts with PCBP2 bound to the viral RNA, and this interaction functions to recruit ribosomes to the viral RNA in a direct or indirect manner, with the participation of additional protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions.
 The neural crest ( NC ) is a group of cells that develops during embryogenesis and gives rise to many different types of cells, including neurons, glia, and melanocytes. Mutations in genes that regulate NC development can lead to a wide range of human diseases. To identify genes and pathways involved in NC development, researchers used a mouse model with a mutation in the Sox10 gene and an ENU mutagenesis screen. They identified four new mutations that affect NC development, including one in the Erbb3 gene. The Erbb3 mutation causes a reduction in the number of Sox10-expressing cells in the cranial ganglia, cranial nerves, and sympathetic chain. Complementation testing confirmed that the mutation is in the Erbb3 gene and that it causes a reduction in ERBB3 signaling. These findings highlight the importance of ERBB3 signaling in NC development and suggest that it may be a target for future therapies for NC-related diseases.
 Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. The heterogeneous nature of human water contact behavior makes it difficult to distinguish between a lack of cercarial exposure and reduced susceptibility to infection as the cause for low levels of infection in the field. In this study, we investigated risk factors for Schistosoma mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community receiving treatment as part of a multi-disciplinary longitudinal reinfection study. We examined the influence that age, sex, and ethnic background have on susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminth drug treatment, but used individual estimates of cercarial exposure and multivariable methods in an attempt to remove noise created by environmental and behavioral heterogeneities. We found that observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in S . mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, as opposed to biological differences in susceptibility to infection. Age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure, however, and appeared linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1 ( formerly Sm22 . 6 ), which itself was significantly related to resistance to reinfection. This study highlights the benefit of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings; it allows the ecology of a population to be understood and thus more robust conclusions to be made.
 Clonorchis sinensis is a parasitic flatworm that causes clonorchiasis, a disease that affects the bile ducts. The worms produce eggs that are shed in the feces of infected people. The number of eggs per gram of feces (EPGs) is a commonly used measure of the intensity of infection. In this study, researchers collected fecal samples from 60 people living in an area where clonorchiasis is common. They counted the number of eggs in each sample and then purged the worms from the feces of 50 egg-positive people. They found that there was a positive correlation between the number of eggs and the number of worms. This means that people with higher EPGs are likely to have more worms. The researchers also estimated the maximum egg count per worm per day and found that it was around 3,770. This is a significant finding because it helps researchers understand the intensity of infection in people with clonorchiasis.
 In this study, the authors used an unbiased genome-wide screen to identify novel genetic components within interaction networks as potential targets in combination therapies for antimicrobial drug resistance. They focused on Candida glabrata, a human fungal pathogen that is resistant to fluconazole (FLZ) and causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. The authors identified 18 synthetically lethal S. cerevisiae genetic mutants that were lethal in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ gain-of-function alleles. One mutant, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was investigated further. Deletion or drug-mediated inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles. Moreover, deletion or drug-mediated inactivation of Gcn5 inhibited the emergence of FLZ-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. The authors suggest that Gcn5 could be a potential target for adjunctive therapy to treat FLZ-resistant infections.
 Poliovirus (PV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that causes paralysis in humans. The life cycle of PV involves the entry of the virus into the host cell, the replication of its genome, and the assembly of new viral particles. The process of genome replication is not well understood, but it is thought to involve the formation of a specialized organelle. In this study, the authors used two PV mutants, EG and GG, to investigate the process of genome replication. They found that the mutants exhibited a delay in the onset of genome replication and a reduction in the production of infectious virus. The authors also observed the formation of unique membranous structures in infected cells, including vesicular clusters and tubules. They suggest that these structures may be involved in the process of genome replication and the assembly of new viral particles.
 We have developed a multi-step cascade strategy using integrated ligand- and target-based virtual screening methods to select a small number of compounds from the ZINC database to be evaluated for trypanocidal activity . We identified 12 non-covalent binding cruzain inhibitors with affinity values ( Ki ) in the low micromolar range ( 3–60 µM ) acting through a competitive inhibition mechanism . Two compounds were found to have trypanocidal activity . Using compound Nequimed42 as precursor , an SAR was established in which the 2-acetamidothiophene-3-carboxamide group was identified as essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition activities . The IC50 value for compound Nequimed42 acting against the trypomastigote form of the Tulahuen lacZ strain was found to be 10 . 6±0 . 1 µM , tenfold lower than that obtained for benznidazole , which was taken as positive control . In addition , by employing the strategy of molecular simplification , a smaller compound derived from Nequimed42 with a ligand efficiency ( LE ) of 0 . 33 kcal mol−1 atom−1 ( compound Nequimed176 ) is highlighted as a novel non-peptidic , non-covalent cruzain inhibitor as a trypanocidal agent candidate for optimization .
Yellow fever ( YF ) is a serious and often fatal disease caused by the yellow fever virus. The only available protection against YF is the YF 17D/17DD vaccine, which has been in use for over 70 years. However, the vaccine has been associated with rare but severe side effects, including fatal reactions. In this study, we developed two non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations encoding the full-length envelope protein of the YF virus and evaluated their immune responses in mice. Both DNA constructs were able to induce strong T-cell responses and high titers of neutralizing antibodies comparable to those elicited by the YF 17DD vaccine. In addition, the DNA vaccine formulation fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 ( LAMP-1 ) provided 100% protection against a lethal challenge in mice. These results suggest that the DNA vaccine formulation fused to LAMP-1 is a promising candidate for further development as a safe and effective alternative to the YF 17D/17DD vaccine.
 Vibrio cholerae is a bacterium that causes cholera, a diarrheal disease. It lives in the marine environment and uses chitin, a polymer of glucosamine, as a food source. The bacterium has a gene called chb that helps it break down chitin and use it for food. The gene is regulated by a protein called ChiS. We used a genetic screen to find a protein that helps ChiS regulate the chb gene. We found that a protein called SlmA helps ChiS regulate the chb gene. We showed that SlmA binds to the DNA of the chb gene and that this binding is important for the regulation of the gene. This finding helps us understand how Vibrio cholerae uses chitin as a food source and how it regulates the genes involved in this process.
 We present a nonlinear programming framework for solving parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Such problems are computationally challenging because they often involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations as well as many experimental data sets and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools which are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. Specifically, our framework uses a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and enables the use of computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. We demonstrate these capabilities by solving estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. We show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points can be solved in less than 3 minutes using our proposed framework ( while an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours ) . We also create large instances to show that the proposed framework is scalable and can solve problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The proposed framework is flexible and easy-to-use, can be broadly applied to dynamic models of biological systems, and enables the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, perform model selection, and handle outliers.
 West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that causes a wide range of clinical symptoms in humans, including fever, headache, and meningitis. The nCounter Mouse Inflammation gene expression kit was used to analyze gene expression changes in multiple tissues over a nine day course of infection in Swiss Webster (SW) mice following intraperitoneal injection with WNV. Protein expression levels for a subset of these cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using a multiplex protein detection system (BioPlex). Expression analysis of spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain of SW mice infected with WNV revealed that Cxcl10 and Il12b are differentially expressed in all tissues tested except kidney. Data stratification of positively confirmed infected (WNV (+)) versus non-infected (WNV (-) tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response from tissue-specific responses arising from WNV infection. Significant (p<0.05) decrease in C3ar1 was found in WNV (-) spleen. Il23a was significantly upregulated, while Il10rb was down-regulated in WNV (-) lung. Il3 and Mbl2 were down-regulated in WNV (-) liver. In WNV (+) livers, Stat1, Tlr2, chemokines Cxcl1, Cxcl3, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, cytokines Il6, Il18, cytokine-related gene Il1r and cytokine agonist Ilrn were significantly upregulated. In summary, the utility of the nCounter platform for rapid identification of gene expression changes in SW mice associated with WNV infection was demonstrated.
A study in Mozambique found that the majority of rabies outbreaks are unreported and data on the epidemiological features of human rabies and animal bites are scarce. The study reviewed cases of human rabies and animal bites from April to July 2014 and carried out a community investigation in July and August in the neighborhoods where cases of human rabies resided. The study found that 14 cases of human rabies were detected in Maputo (n=10), Matola (n=3), and Boane district (n=1) between April and August 2014, all of whom had a recent history of dog bite. Of the 14 rabid dogs, only one had been immunized. Factors significantly associated with human rabies were: age <15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by unimmunized dog, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. The study recommends that control measures for rabies be implemented in Maputo and Matola cities, where cases of human rabies were strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular implementation of post-exposure measures.
21 members of a large Utah family were found to have febrile seizures (FS) and linkage to a region on chromosome 2q24. We identified a potential mutation in the SCN9A gene, which encodes the Nav1 . 7 sodium channel, in 21 affected family members. The mutation, p . N641Y, was absent from 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To establish a functional role for this mutation in seizure susceptibility, we introduced the orthologous mutation into the murine Scn9a ortholog using targeted homologous recombination. Compared to wild-type mice, homozygous Scn9aN641Y/N641Y knockin mice exhibited significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates. These data strongly support the SCN9A p . N641Y mutation as disease-causing in this family. We also analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients and identified additional highly conserved Nav1 . 7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. After one of these children with FS later developed Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy), we sequenced the SCN1A gene and identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients yielded nine Nav1 . 7 missense variants (8% of the patients), all in highly conserved amino acids. Six of these Dravet syndrome patients with SCN9A missense variants also harbored either missense or splice site SCN1A mutations, and three had no SCN1A mutations. This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations.
 The GPT-framework is a new computational model for understanding how complex tissue shapes may arise through growth. It is based on the idea that orientations of growth can be specified independently of stresses through molecular signalling. The framework allows for the simulation of tissue growth and deformation, and has been applied to a growing Snapdragon flower. The results suggest that the GPT-framework provides a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of morphogenesis.
 We present a new method to estimate the demographic history of a set of populations from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) computed on large genomic datasets. Our approach is based on a composite-likelihood approach that allows one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity. We show that our method is more accurate and faster than other current likelihood-based methods. We first apply our method to non-coding genomic SNP data from four human populations. We then show the versatility of our framework by extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from SNP chip data with known ascertainment bias. We apply this approach to the reconstruction of African demography using two distinct ascertained SNP panels studied under two evolutionary models. Our method appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large genomic data sets.
 We have developed a methodology for the estimation of the in vivo cell killing ability of cisplatin-based doublet regimens in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ). The methodology is based on the provision of tumor volumetric data at two time points, before and after or during treatment. It takes into account the effect of tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. A thorough sensitivity analysis based on one-factor-at-a-time and latin hypercube sampling/partial rank correlation coefficient approaches has established the volume growth rate and the growth fraction at diagnosis as key features for more accurate estimates. The methodology is applied on the retrospective data of thirteen patients with NSCLC who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The selection of model input values has been guided by a comprehensive literature survey on cancer-specific proliferation kinetics. The latin hypercube sampling has been recruited to compensate for patient-specific uncertainties. Concluding, the present work provides a quantitative framework for the estimation of the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies. Correlation studies of such estimates with the molecular profile of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
 Biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance is a major health threat due to the high levels of tolerance exhibited by biofilm bacteria. In this study, we used random transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific tolerant mutants normally exhibited by subpopulations located in specialized niches of heterogeneous biofilms. We demonstrated that starved biofilms exhibited significantly greater tolerance towards fluoroquinolone ofloxacin than their planktonic counterparts. We further demonstrated that ofloxacin tolerance was induced as a function of biofilm age, which was dependent on the SOS response. Our results therefore show that the SOS stress response induced in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a molecular mechanism leading to biofilm-specific high tolerance to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin.
 Plasmodium falciparum malaria is caused by the blood stage of the parasite life cycle, which involves the invasion of red blood cells by merozoites. The invasion process requires specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands that are localized in apical organelles called micronemes. Here, we identify cAMP as a key regulator that triggers the timely secretion of microneme proteins enabling receptor-engagement and invasion. We demonstrate that exposure of merozoites to a low K+ environment, typical of blood plasma, activates a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adenylyl cyclase to raise cytosolic cAMP levels and activate protein kinase A, which regulates microneme secretion. We also show that cAMP regulates merozoite cytosolic Ca2+ levels via induction of an Epac pathway and demonstrate that increases in both cAMP and Ca2+ are essential to trigger microneme secretion. Our identification of the different elements in cAMP-dependent signaling pathways that regulate microneme secretion during invasion provides novel targets to inhibit blood stage parasite growth and prevent malaria.
 Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted nematode that causes strongyloidiasis, a neglected tropical disease. It is found worldwide, except for the far north and south, but information about its prevalence is often little more than educated guesses. The diagnostic methods most commonly used for soil-transmitted helminth detection, such as direct fecal smear or Kato-Katz, have low sensitivity for S . stercoralis or fail to detect it altogether. The full life cycle of S . stercoralis was disclosed in the 1930s, and it can reproduce within a human host, resulting in long-lasting infection. Some studies report individuals with infections sustained for more than 75 years. S . stercoralis is an exception among helminthic parasites in that it can cause systemic infection, which may lead to fatal hyperinfection syndrome in immunosuppressed individuals. Asymptomatic infections are particularly dangerous, as they have the potential to develop fatal disseminated forms when immunosuppressive treatment is carried out without proper screening. Genta summarized information on global distribution of S . stercoralis for the first time in 1989, finding it to be highly prevalent in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. He also pointed out that many reports suggested high infection rates in South-East Asia and described several risk groups, including refugees and immigrants. The objectives of our study were to obtain country-wide estimates of S . stercoralis infection risk in the general population and to assess the association between S . stercoralis prevalence and different risk groups. We reviewed the available literature and carried out a Bayesian meta-analysis, taking into account the sensitivity of the different diagnostic tools. The models allowed estimation of the diagnostic sensitivity for different study types and risk groups. Our findings show high infection prevalence rates in the general population in selected countries and geographical regions. S . stercoralis infection is prominent in several risk groups. Adequate information on the prevalence is still lacking from many countries. However, current information underscores that S . stercoralis must not be neglected. Further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings are needed and integration into global helminth control is warranted.
 The circadian clock is a complex system that generates daily rhythms in gene expression and physiology. The clock is organized in a hierarchical fashion, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serving as the master pacemaker and keeping individual cells in tight synchrony. However, the mechanisms by which the clock is entrained to external cues and how it generates rhythms at the cellular level are not well understood. In this study, we show that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise, and one that can be applied to future and existing high-throughput circadian screens. Using cell-autonomous fibroblast data, we first show directly that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. Next, we show that the damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators, and confirm that such a change can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. We further demonstrate the insights that can be gained by applying our method to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. Finally, we hypothesize that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as very few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly with regard to the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics.
 The recent increase in antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria calls for new approaches to drug-target selection and drug development. Targeting the mechanisms of action of proteins involved in bacterial cell division bypasses problems associated with increasingly ineffective variants of older antibiotics. FtsZ is a promising target as it is an essential bacterial cytoskeletal protein and a GTPase that plays a central role in cell division. PC190723 is a small molecule inhibitor of FtsZ that has shown promising in vitro and in vivo activity against Gram-positive bacteria. However, the mechanism of drug action and its effect on FtsZ in other bacterial species are unclear. Here, we examine the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket using PocketFEATURE, a statistical method that scores the similarity between pairs of small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure information about the local microenvironment, and molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with substantially disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. Based on PocketFEATURE analysis of MD simulations of S. aureus FtsZ bound to GTP or with mutations that are known to confer PC190723 resistance, we predict that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state. Furthermore, MD simulations of an FtsZ dimer indicated that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states, yielding important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors.
 The integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the host cell genome is a crucial step in the retroviral life cycle. This process is catalyzed by integrase ( IN ) , a virus-derived enzyme. We now present a crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains ( NTD and CCD ) of HIV-2 IN in complex with the IN binding domain ( IBD ) of LEDGF. The structure extends the known IN–LEDGF interface, elucidating primarily charge–charge interactions between the NTD of IN and the IBD. A constellation of acidic residues on the NTD is characteristic of lentiviral INs, and mutations of the positively charged residues on the IBD severely affect interaction with all lentiviral INs tested. We show that the novel NTD–IBD contacts are critical for stimulation of concerted lentiviral DNA integration by LEDGF in vitro and for its function during the early steps of HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, the new structural details enabled us to engineer a mutant of HIV-1 IN that primarily functions only when presented with a complementary LEDGF mutant. These findings provide structural basis for the high affinity lentiviral IN–LEDGF interaction and pave the way for development of LEDGF-based targeting technologies for gene therapy.
 The study investigates the evolutionary trajectories of cancer stem cells (CSC) and their kinetics that determine initial cell and tumor population progression dynamics. The authors develop a cellular automaton model that tracks the temporal evolution of the malignant subpopulation of CSCs. They explore orthogonal cell traits, including cell migration, spontaneous cell death due to genetic drift after accumulation of irreversible deleterious mutations, symmetric CSC division that increases the CSC pool, and telomere length and erosion as a mitotic counter for inherited non-stem cancer cell proliferation potential. The study suggests that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. Early increase in proliferation potential yields larger populations of non-stem cancer cells (CC) that compete with CSC and thus inhibit CSC division. A reduction in proliferation potential loosens such inhibition and facilitates frequent CSC division. The sub-population of cancer stem cells in itself becomes highly heterogeneous, dictating population level dynamics that vary from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression. The study suggests that the clonal diversity that is captured in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes.
 Zoonotic diseases are a major threat to human health, and the emergence of new diseases is a growing concern. In this study, we used mathematical models to investigate the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the emergence of new diseases. We found that the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude that the vast majority of communities are likely to be well interconnected, and that the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be weak. We also provide analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction and the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Our results have important implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.
 Avian influenza viruses ( AIV ) have been implicated in the emergence of human and livestock influenza . However, the patterns of viral spread and subsequent risk posed by wild bird viruses remain unpredictable. In this study, we analyzed genomic data of 287 newly sequenced AIV samples isolated over a 34-year period of continuous systematic surveillance of North American migratory birds. We used a Bayesian statistical framework to test hypotheses of viral migration, population structure, and patterns of genetic reassortment. Our results revealed that despite the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay, this host population does not appear to significantly contribute to the North American AIV diversity sampled in Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseriformes. While AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, our large-scale analysis showed that the long-term persistence of AIV was independent of bird flyways with migration between populations throughout North America. Our findings provide vital insights to develop appropriately informed predictive models critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection.
 Influenza A viruses are divided into 16 subtypes based on their hemagglutinin (HA) proteins. These subtypes have different antigenic properties and are generally not cross-reactive. However, a new monoclonal antibody (MAb) has been generated that recognizes a common epitope on the globular head region of HA and neutralizes viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo. This MAb also inhibits virus attachment to cells. These findings suggest that cross-reactive antibodies may play a role in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection.
 Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted helminth that causes a chronic infection in humans. The infection is common in both developing and developed countries, with an estimated 30-100 million cases worldwide. The major medical impact of infection is the occurrence of strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, which occurs predominantly in infected adults who become immunosuppressed. To assess the effect of treatment with ivermectin on the prevalence of S . stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population over a three year period, and to assess the validity of using a lower ELISA cut-off in diagnosis, a three-year cohort study of 259 adult Australian Aboriginals living in a remote community in northern Australia was conducted. Treatment with ivermectin was highly effective and resulted in a sustained fall in the prevalence of infection in the study group. Results of treatment suggested use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. Follow up identified a small group of subjects with persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment. Control of S . stercoralis infection in this cohort appears to be feasible using pharmacological treatment alone. , Introduction:  Infection with the soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) Strongyloides stercoralis is common in both the developing world and in underprivileged communities in developed countries. Prevalence is frequently estimated at 30–100 million cases worldwide, but due to difficulties with diagnosis, the frequent absence of symptoms in chronic cases, and the lack of extensive screening for the infection, this may be an under-estimate. The major medical impact of infection is thought to be the occurrence of strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, which occurs predominantly in infected adults who become immunosuppressed. It is increasingly acknowledged that S . stercoralis infection represents a significant public health challenge and that action is required to deal with the problem. Some advocate the need for extensive environmental management of the problem to interrupt transmission in endemic communities. They point out that pharmacological treatment can have side effects, cannot prevent re-infection from environmental sources of the infection, and that resistance to ivermectin may develop with excessive use. Others emphasize the efficacy and safety of treatment with ivermectin, and advocate pharmacological control, with possible mass drug administrations ( MDA ) in communities that have a high prevalence of infection in accordance with programs currently employed to control other soil transmitted helminth and vector borne nematode infections. It should be pointed out that the optimal measures for control of strongyloides infection may differ from situation to situation, depending upon local factors such as rainfall and vegetation, the importance of agricultural practices in transmission, and the presence or otherwise of adequate health infrastructure. Because of the chronic nature of this infection and its capacity for sustained auto-infection within individuals, it is possible to have a high prevalence of infection both in communities where conditions allow for high transmission rates of the infection, and equally in communities where transmission is lower, but there are a high number of chronic, untreated infections. The Aboriginal communities of northern Australia are home to some of the highest measured prevalence of this infection, with rates of 30–40% reported. Oral ivermectin is now accepted as the treatment of choice for this condition, but disagreement persists over the need for wide spread testing and elimination of the infection. Attention has been drawn to some of the barriers preventing control of infection in these communities, including difficulties with diagnosis and lack of adequate follow up of treated cases. Direct parasitological diagnosis of infection and other coprological methods are generally not feasible in these isolated communities, and are known to have a low sensitivity even when performed under optimal conditions. ELISA testing is now generally accepted as being sensitive and specific enough for use in both clinical and research settings. Concerns over cross reactivity with other helminth infections have less relevance in the Australian setting where these infections are not found. In practical terms in the Australian setting this equates to testing using one of several commercially available ELISA tests. The reference ranges for these tests were developed in relatively low prevalence populations and were intended to prevent false positive results in situations where the infection is uncommon. For example, the unreferenced product information for one such test ( DRG laboratories ) advises clinicians that normal ranges may need to be interpreted “in the context of local settings”. Anecdotally, it is reported that for this reason, clinicians working in communities where the infection is known to be endemic frequently treat patients whose ELISA results fall under the published range, in an attempt to avoid missing infections.
 Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded form of the prion protein, PrPSc, which can exist in different strains. These strains can interfere with each other, leading to changes in the emergence of prion strains from a mixture. In this study, we found that two long-incubation period strains did not interfere with each other in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that the abundance of PrPC is not limiting in vivo or in vitro. This observation changes the paradigm of the interactions of prion strains and has implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.
 Allosteric regulation is a common mechanism in proteins that allows them to respond to changes in their environment. Intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) are prevalent in allosteric regulation, but their role in this process is not well understood. In this study, the authors propose a comprehensive ensemble model to compare the roles of both order-order transition and disorder-order transition in allosteric effect. They find that the MWC pathway ( order-order transition ) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway ( disorder-order transition ) in allostery, suggesting a complicated role of IDPs/IDRs in regulatory proteins. The authors also obtain an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response, which shows that too stable or too unstable state is unfavorable to endow allostery, and is thus helpful for rational design of allosteric drugs.
β-Catenin is a protein that plays an important role in many developmental processes and has been implicated in tumorigenesis in many tissues, including prostate cancer. However, the role of β-Catenin in prostate cancer is unclear. We used in vivo genetic studies in the embryo and adult to extend our understanding of the role of β-Catenin in the normal and neoplastic prostate. Our gene deletion analysis revealed that prostate epithelial β-Catenin is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching but is dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin controls the number of progenitors in the epithelial buds and regulates a discrete network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. Deletion of β-Catenin in a Pten deleted model of castration-resistant prostate cancer demonstrated it is dispensable for disease progression in this setting. Complementary overexpression experiments, through in vivo protein stabilization, showed that β-Catenin promotes the formation of squamous epithelium during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. β-Catenin overexpression in combination with Pten loss was able to drive progression to invasive carcinoma together with squamous metaplasia. These studies demonstrate that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that an inherent property of high levels of this protein in prostate epithelia is to drive squamous fate differentiation. In addition, they show that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of this disease. These data provide novel information on cancer progression pathways that give rise to lethal prostate disease in humans.
 Informed consent is a fundamental requirement for ethical research. However, the process of obtaining informed consent can be challenging in developing countries where disease burden is high. Understanding the role of local factors is important for undertaking ethical research in developing countries. We explored factors relating to information and communication during the process of informed consent and the approach that should be followed for gaining consent. The study was conducted prior to a family-based genetic study among people with podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) in southern Ethiopia. We adapted a method of rapid assessment validated in The Gambia. The methodology was entirely qualitative, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews. Discussions were conducted with podoconiosis patients and non-patients in the community, fieldworkers, researchers, staff of the local non-governmental organization (NGO) working on prevention and treatment of podoconiosis, and community leaders. We found that the extent of use of everyday language, the degree to which expectations of potential participants were addressed, and the techniques of presentation of information had considerable impact on comprehension of information provided about research. Approaching podoconiosis patients via locally trusted individuals and preceding individual consent with community sensitization were considered the optimal means of communication. Prevailing poverty among podoconiosis patients, the absence of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local NGO were identified as potential barriers for obtaining genuine informed consent. Researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes in providing appropriate information in a comprehensible manner and in supporting voluntary decision-making on a study-by-study basis.
5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) is a thymidine analogue that can be incorporated into DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. We used EdU to investigate the dynamics of proliferation of T lymphocytes across their differentiation through thymus and spleen in mice. Our investigation is based on single-cell multicolour flow cytometry analysis revealing the active incorporation of EdU during S phase after pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo. A generic mathematical model of state transition simulates through Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) the evolution of single cell behaviour during various durations of labelling. It allows us to fit our data, to deduce proliferation rates and estimate cell cycle durations in sub-populations. Our model is simple and flexible and is validated with other durations of pulse/chase experiments. Our results reveal that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous but with a specific “signature” that depends upon genetic origins, is specific to cell differentiation stages in thymus and spleen and is altered with age. In conclusion, our model allows us to infer proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from complex experimental EdU data, revealing T cell proliferation heterogeneity and specific signatures.
 Mitochondrial tRNA mutations are known to cause diseases in humans, but the molecular mechanisms behind these mutations are not well understood. In this study, we report the generation and characterization of the first mitochondrial tRNA pathological mutation in mouse cells, an m . 3739G>A transition in the mitochondrial mt-Ti gene. This mutation recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation described in humans, an m . 4290T>C transition affecting also the human mt-Ti gene. We found that the pathogenic molecular mechanism, induced by both the mouse and the human mutations, is a high frequency of abnormal folding of the tRNAIle that cannot be charged with isoleucine. We also demonstrated that cells harboring the mouse or human mutant tRNA have exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by an increase in mitochondrial ROS production as a compensatory response. We propose that both the nature of the pathogenic mechanism combined with the existence of a compensatory mechanism can explain the penetrance pattern of this mutation. This particular behavior can allow a scenario for the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs in which the fixation of two alleles that are individually deleterious can proceed in two steps and not require the simultaneous mutation of both.
 In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by doubling the expression of X-linked genes in both sexes, together with X inactivation in females. In this study, we used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells. While the average X:autosome expression ratio was about 1 in normal diploid cells, this ratio was lower (0.81-0.84) in triploid cells with one active X and higher (1.32-1.4) in triploid cells with two active X's. Thus, overall X-linked gene expression in triploid cells does not strictly respond to an autosomal factor, nor is it adjusted to achieve a perfect balance. The unbalanced X:autosome expression ratios that we observed could contribute to the abnormal phenotypes associated with triploidy. Absolute autosomal expression levels per gene copy were similar in triploid versus diploid cells, indicating no apparent global effect on autosomal expression. In triploid cells with two active X's, our data support a basic doubling of X-linked gene expression. However, in triploid cells with a single active X, X-linked gene expression is adjusted upward presumably by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets. Such a mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose expression dosage in relation to autosomal expression may be critical. Indeed, we found that there was a range of individual X-linked gene expression in relation to ploidy and that a small subset (∼7%) of genes had expression levels apparently proportional to the number of autosomal sets.
 The dN/dS ratio is a commonly used measure of selection on protein-coding regions. It is often assumed that the dN/dS ratio is calculated from sequences sampled from different species, but it is also frequently used to analyze sequences from a single population. We found that the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to selection when calculated from sequences sampled from a single population. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection across different species, dN/dS>1, does not hold within a population. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.
 We have shown that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between closely and distantly related species. We found that neutral divergence between closely related species ( e.g. human-primate ) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. We also found that neutral divergence between distantly related species ( e.g. human-rodent ) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for the confounding factors of hypermutable CpG sites, GC content, and biased gene conversion. Coalescent models indicate that even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome, generating the observed correlations. Our findings reveal that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species. Though we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the direct effects of purifying selection drive some of these patterns, such a scenario would be possible only if more of the genome is under purifying selection than currently believed. Our work has implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.
The circadian clock is a biological system that regulates the timing of various physiological processes in living organisms. In Drosophila, the circadian clock is composed of a set of transcription factors that form negative feedback loops to regulate their own expression. Phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism for protein stability and activity in the circadian clock. In this study, the authors show that the CK2 kinase phosphorylates and destabilizes the CLK activator directly, in addition to its previously known role in phosphorylating and destabilizing the PER and TIM repressors. They also show that downregulation of CK2α activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases per and tim transcription. These results indicate that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. The authors suggest that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2.
 Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans and is transmitted by the bite of the insect vector Triatoma prolixus. In this study, we investigated whether cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase of T. cruzi, is involved in the interaction of the parasite with the insect vector. We found that anti-cruzipain antibodies and cysteine peptidase inhibitors significantly reduced the adhesion of T. cruzi epimastigotes to the posterior midgut of R. prolixus ex vivo. Additionally, we found that transgenic parasites overexpressing chagasin, an endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, adhered to the insect gut 73% less than wild-type parasites. These findings suggest that cruzipain plays a role in the interaction of T. cruzi with the insect vector.
 The microtubule motor protein dynein is essential for many cellular processes, including mitosis and meiosis. However, the mechanisms that target and regulate dynein are not well understood. In this study, we used a conditional cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans to screen for suppressor genes. We identified 20 genes that, when reduced in function, suppress the dynein mutant. Many of these suppressor genes encode proteins that localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported for dynein. We also found that some accessory chains negatively regulate dynein function. Our results suggest that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during essential cellular processes.
During somatic differentiation, programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can drive genome rearrangements to safeguard genome integrity. In Paramecium tetraurelia, the development of the somatic nucleus involves massive genome rearrangements, including the precise elimination of at least 45,000 germline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). IES excision proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism, with a domesticated piggyBac transposase (PiggyMac) essential for DNA cleavage and DSB repair at excision sites. Here, we show that the development-specific Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus. Strikingly, at the molecular level, PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage is abolished at IES boundaries in cells depleted for Ku80c, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. Ku and PiggyMac co-purify as a complex when overproduced in a heterologous system. We conclude that Ku has been integrated in the Paramecium DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR.
 Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect both humans and animals. The conversion of the normal prion protein to the infectious form is responsible for the disease pathology, which is characterized by deposits of protease-resistant prion protein, extensive vacuolation, and microgliosis and astrocytosis. Although this protein conversion typically occurs over a long pre-clinical incubation period, neuronal dysfunction has been observed at these non-symptomatic stages of disease. In particular, synaptic loss was identified in animal models of prion disease prior to the manifestation of clinical symptoms. To identify the specific cellular responses by neurons to the presence of PrPRes, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons and determined their pre-clinical transcriptional response during infection. We found that gene expression within these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity. We also found that a major cluster of genes is altered during pre-clinical disease after which expression either returns to basal levels or alternatively undergoes a direct reversal during clinical disease. These findings suggest that prion replication results in the persistent stimulation of a programmed response that is mediated, at least in part, by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodeling. However, this response is terminated prior to the onset of clinical symptoms in the infected hippocampus, seemingly pointing to a critical juncture in the disease. Manipulation of these early neuroprotective pathways may redress the balance between degeneration and survival, providing a potential inroad for treatment.
 Experimental visceral leishmaniasis (EVL) is a murine model of the human disease caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The model is characterized by focal accumulation of inflammatory cells in the liver, forming discrete granulomas within which the parasite is eventually eliminated. To better understand the development and function of these granulomas, we developed an in silico Petri net model that simulates hepatic granuloma development throughout the course of infection. The model was extensively validated by comparison with experimental data and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess its robustness. The model recapitulated the progression of disease as seen during experimental infection and predicted many of the changes in cellular composition seen within granulomas over time. By conducting in silico experiments, we identified a previously unappreciated level of inter-granuloma diversity in terms of the development of anti-leishmanial activity. Furthermore, by simulating the impact of IL-10 gene deficiency in a variety of lymphocyte and myeloid cell populations, our data suggest a dominant local regulatory role for IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells at the core of the granuloma.
 In this study, the authors explore the computational capabilities of transcriptional regulatory networks. They show that different parameterizations of a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation can approximate all four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as various equality and inequality operations. They also demonstrate that networks of these “arithmetic” genes can be combined to approximate more complex functions. The authors analyze the accuracy and precision of these approximations, showing that they depend on different sets of parameters and are thus independently tunable. These observations are important for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and imply new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.
 Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes fever and joint pain. It has three distinct genotypes: West African, East/Central/South African, and Asian/Caribbean. The Asian/Caribbean genotype is mainly endemic/epidemic among human populations, while the East/Central/South African genotype is mainly maintained in enzootic cycles among non-human primates with sporadic spillover to humans. In 2014, the East/Central/South African genotype was introduced into Brazil and has since spread to other regions. In this study, we sequenced CHIKV genomes from a recent outbreak in the Northeast region of Brazil and found that both Asian/Caribbean and East/Central/South African genotypes were present. We also found evidence of coinfection by these two genotypes in some patients. Our results suggest that both genotypes are simultaneously circulating in the Northeast region of Brazil.
 The study investigates the role of the H-NS protein in the regulation of horizontally acquired DNA in bacteria. H-NS is a protein that binds to DNA and regulates gene expression. The study found that H-NS discriminates between core and horizontally acquired DNA and selectively silences horizontally acquired DNA. This finding suggests that H-NS may have evolved to provide a fitness advantage by allowing the presence of a large number of silent virulence genes to be available, without interfering with the regulation of the bacterial core genome.
 Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. The parasites have a complex life cycle that involves both extracellular and intracellular stages. The intracellular stages are responsible for the pathogenicity of the disease. The authors of this study have used customized oligonucleotide microarrays to study the gene expression of Leishmania parasites during their intracellular stages. They found that only a small number of genes are differentially expressed between species and that fewer still are regulated during the parasite life cycle. The authors suggest that parasites do not respond dynamically to host immune pressure and that any influence of varying transcript levels on virulence and pathogenicity of different Leishmania species is likely to result from the differential expression of conserved genes between species and/or the expression of a small number of genes that are differentially distributed between species.
 Amphimeriasis is a foodborne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp. that has recently been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador with a high prevalence in humans and domestic animals. The diagnosis is based on the stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but it lacks sensitivity. Additionally, the morphology of the eggs may be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed to date. New diagnostic techniques for specific and sensitive detection of Amphimerus spp. DNA in clinical samples are needed. A LAMP targeting a sequence of the Amphimerus sp. internal transcribed spacer 2 region was designed. Amphimerus sp. DNA was obtained from adult worms recovered from animals and used to optimize the molecular assays. Conventional PCR was performed using outer primers F3-B3 to verify the proper amplification of the Amphimerus sp. DNA target sequence. LAMP was optimized using different reaction mixtures and temperatures, and it was finally set up as LAMPhimerus. The specificity and sensitivity of both PCR and LAMP were evaluated. The detection limit was 1 pg of genomic DNA. Field testing was done using 44 human stool samples collected from localities where fluke is endemic. Twenty-five samples were microscopy positive for Amphimerus sp. eggs detection. In molecular testing, PCR F3-B3 was ineffective when DNA from fecal samples was used. When testing all human stool samples included in our study, the diagnostic parameters for the sensitivity and specificity were calculated for our LAMPhimerus assay, which were 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively. We have developed and evaluated, for the first time, a specific and sensitive LAMP assay for detecting Amphimerus sp. in human stool samples. The procedure has been named LAMPhimerus method and has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas. Future large-scale studies will assess the applicability of this novel LAMP assay.
 Autophagy is a process in which cells degrade and recycle their own components. This process involves the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, which then degrade the contents of the autophagosome. The fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes is mediated by a complex of SNARE proteins. In this study, the authors identified a new SNARE protein, Ykt6, that is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. They found that Ykt6 is not redundant with the previously identified SNARE proteins, and that it interacts with the HOPS tethering complex. The authors also found that the zero layer arginine of Ykt6 is not essential for its function. These findings suggest that Ykt6 plays a unique role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
 Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) are important components of the innate immune system that target bacterial membranes and disrupt transmembrane potential, leading to bacterial cell death . Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHI ) is a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa but is also associated with opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts . NTHI has evolved mechanisms to resist the bactericidal effects of host-derived AMPs, including the Sap ( sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides ) ABC transporter . We previously demonstrated that SapA, the periplasmic binding protein of the Sap transporter, binds AMPs and is required for NTHI virulence in vivo . In this work, we show that SapA functions to directly counter AMP lethality during NTHI infection by delivering AMPs to the Sap inner membrane complex for transport into the bacterial cytoplasm. We observed that AMPs localize to the bacterial cytoplasm of the parental NTHI strain and are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptidase activity. In striking contrast, AMPs accumulated in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex. These data support a mechanism of Sap-mediated import of AMPs, a novel strategy to reduce periplasmic and inner membrane accumulation of these host defense peptides.
 The bacterial protein MarA is a key regulator of antibiotic resistance genes. It is expressed stochastically, meaning that some cells express it at high levels while others do not. This stochastic expression creates diversity within the population, allowing some cells to survive antibiotic exposure while others die. The half-life of MarA affects how quickly this diversity appears and how much diversity is achieved. We modified the half-life of MarA either by knocking down the protease that targets it or by engineering MarA to protect it from degradation. Our results show that active degradation can impact both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. This suggests that active degradation plays a role in shaping how regulatory proteins coordinate their downstream targets.
 In this study, we investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 ( MKP-2 ) in the immune response to Leishmania major infection in C57BL/6 mice. We found that MKP-2−/− mice were more susceptible to L . major infection than wild-type mice, with larger lesion size and higher parasite burden. However, the immune response to L . major infection in MKP-2−/− mice was not significantly different from that of wild-type mice, with similar levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We also found that MKP-2−/− macrophages were more permissive to L . major growth than wild-type macrophages, but classically activated MKP-2−/− macrophages were equally effective at controlling parasite growth as wild-type macrophages. These findings suggest that MKP-2 does not play a significant role in the immune response to L . major infection in C57BL/6 mice.
 The pancreas is a branched organ that undergoes a complex process of ductal remodeling during development. In this study, the authors quantify the network properties of the pancreatic ductal system at different developmental stages and find that it exhibits stereotypic traits. They also develop a simple rule-based model to explain the early and later stages of network development. The authors suggest that their findings may be relevant to several other glands and could help in understanding the mechanisms of ductal remodeling in various organs.
 Kinesin motor proteins drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes that mediate directed movement along microtubules. In this study, we report a comprehensive principal component analysis of 114 experimental structures along with the results of conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations that together map the structural dynamics of the kinesin motor domain. We found that all experimental structures reside in one of three distinct conformational clusters (ATP-like, ADP-like and Eg5 inhibitor-bound). These groups differ in the orientation of key functional elements, most notably the microtubule binding α4–α5 subdomain. Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of ATP, ADP and nucleotide free Eg5 indicate that all three nucleotide states could sample the major crystallographically observed conformations. Differences in the dynamic coupling of distal sites were also evident. Our combined results indicate that the reported ATP and ADP-like conformations of kinesin are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide state and support a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions.
 The Lux system is a powerful tool for measuring gene expression in bacteria and eukaryotic cells. However, the bioluminescence produced by the Lux system is not a direct measure of gene expression, but rather an integrated signal of transcription, mRNA half-life, translation, protein turnover, and the bioluminescence reaction kinetics and substrate availability and cycling. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a new mathematical model for Lux activity that includes the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for all reactions, as well as synthesis and turnover of Lux proteins. The model is calibrated with new experimental data for the LuxAB and Fre reactions from Photorhabdus luminescens, the source of modern Lux reporters, while literature data has been used for LuxEC. Importantly, the data show clear evidence for previously unreported product inhibition for the LuxAB reaction. Model simulations show that predicted bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output, very similar to light output seen in some experimental data sets. By incorporating the calibrated model into a Bayesian inference scheme, we can reverse engineer promoter activity from the bioluminescence. We show examples where a decrease in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a switching off of the promoter, or where an increase in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a longer period of gene expression. This approach could benefit all users of Lux technology.
 The replication of enteroviruses, which cause hand, foot and mouth disease in children, can be inhibited by the capsid binder GPP3. Here, we present the crystal structure of CVA16 in complex with GPP3, which clarifies the role of the key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. Based on this model, in silico docking was performed to investigate the interactions with the two next-generation capsid binders NLD and ALD, which we show to be potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with potentially interesting pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was performed using the available structural information to obtain a deeper insight into those structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and also those that confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity.
 The immune response to fungal and Gram-positive infections in Drosophila is regulated by the serpin-family inhibitor Necrotic . Following immune-challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated which signals through the Toll receptor . Toll activation results in a range of antibiotic peptides being synthesized in the fat-body and exported to the haemolymph . As with mammalian serpins, Necrotic turnover in Drosophila is rapid. This serpin is synthesized in the fat-body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. By “freezing” endocytosis with a temperature sensitive Dynamin mutation, we demonstrate that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. Necrotic uptake responds rapidly to infection, being visibly increased after 30 mins and peaking at 6–8 hours. Co-localisation of anti-Nec with anti-AP50, Rab5, and Rab7 antibodies establishes that the serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localises with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. Nec does not co-localise with Rab11, indicating that the serpin is not re-exported from athrocytes. Instead, mutations which block late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor, hk, and car) cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of the 6 Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family with dsRNA identifies LpR1 as an enhancer of the immune response. Uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. In conclusion, we identify the cells and the receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades.
 In sea urchins , Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side . However , the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during LR axis establishment is not clear . In this study , we revealed that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch , specifically in the veg2 lineage , but not in the small micromeres . By perturbing BMP activities , we demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for activating the expression of the left-sided genes and the formation of the left-sided structures . On the other hand , Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres . Our findings show that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins , suggesting that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes .
 Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a common human pathogen that can cause serious disease in immunocompromised patients and neonates . HCMV can exist in two states: lytic infection, where the virus replicates and causes cell death, and latent infection, where the virus remains dormant without causing harm to the host . During lytic infection, the onset of viral immediate early ( IE ) gene expression is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle . Infected G0/G1 cells support viral IE gene expression and proceed to the G1/S boundary where they finally arrest . In contrast, S/G2 cells can be infected but effectively block IE gene expression and this inhibition is not relieved until host cells have divided and reentered G1 . During latent infection, IE gene expression is also inhibited, and for reactivation to occur, this block to IE gene expression must be overcome . In this study, the authors show that the block to IE gene expression during S and G2 phase can be overcome by both genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, pointing to the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways in controlling IE gene repression. They also found that requirement for the cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21 downstream of p53 suggests a pivotal role for CDKs in controlling IE gene repression in S/G2 and treatment of S/G2 cells with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine alleviates IE repression independently of p53. Importantly, CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 ( NT2 ) cells. Thus, a timely block to CDK activity not only secures phase specificity of the cell cycle dependent HCMV IE gene expression program, but in addition plays a hitherto unrecognized role in preventing the establishment of a latent-like state.
 Elite controllers are a small group of HIV-1-infected individuals who can control their infection without antiretroviral therapy. The mechanisms that allow elite controllers to control their infection are not well understood. In this study, the authors found that conventional dendritic cells (DCs) from elite controllers have the ability to mount a cell-intrinsic immune response to HIV-1 infection, which is important for inducing effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. The authors suggest that this cell-intrinsic immune response may be a key mechanism that allows elite controllers to control their infection. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of immune control of HIV-1 infection and may lead to the development of new immunotherapies for HIV-1.
 Obesity is a complex condition that involves many different factors, including genetics, environment, and lifestyle. While there are many known genes associated with obesity, the exact mechanisms by which these genes contribute to the condition are not fully understood. To better understand the genetic factors that contribute to obesity, researchers have turned to model organisms such as fruit flies. By studying the effects of mutations in fruit flies, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of obesity and how it develops. In this study, researchers used a simple screening method to identify genes that affect fat storage in fruit flies. They found 66 genes that, when mutated, caused an increase in fat storage. One of these genes was Sir2, a member of the sirtuin family of proteins. Sir2 has been shown to play a role in energy metabolism in mammals, but its specific function has been difficult to determine. The researchers found that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner. They also found that Sir2 mutant larvae survive better than wild type under conditions of amino acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. These findings suggest that Sir2 plays a role in regulating fat storage and metabolism in fruit flies, and may provide insights into the mechanisms of obesity in humans.
 We studied the process of asymmetric cell division in 42 species of nematodes, which is a model system for studying the biophysical properties of asymmetric spindle positioning. We recorded the first embryonic division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis species, which are accessible at http://www . ens-lyon . fr/LBMC/NematodeCell/videos/. We analyzed our collection to study the evolution of asymmetric spindle positioning. We found that although all the strains underwent an asymmetric first cell division, they exhibited large intra- and inter-species variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and several parameters controlling spindle movement, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed frequently during evolution with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, with the exception of spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. These changes were also unrelated to evolutionary variations in embryo size. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation each evolved independently. This finding contrasts starkly with expectations based on C . elegans studies and reveals previously unrecognized evolutionary changes in spindle mechanics. Collectively, these data demonstrate that while the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over the course of nematode evolution, the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways. Like other developmental processes, asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift.
 The OmpR DNA binding protein of Gram-negative bacteria has the potential to govern collectives of genes whose membership is subject to change. This is because OmpR demonstrates only moderate specificity for its DNA targets, allowing new binding sites to arise de novo in relatively few mutagenic steps. Furthermore, OmpR has the potential to respond to more than one environmental signal, giving it the potential to participate in regulon evolution from the standpoint of regulatory signal reception. Our findings show that OmpR expression is regulated differently in S . Typhimurium and E . coli and that there are very large differences in the composition of the OmpR regulons in these bacterial species. We find that OmpR shows little DNA sequence specificity in its binding sites and propose that this makes OmpR particularly useful for bringing horizontally acquired genes into an established regulatory circuit encoded by the core genome.
 Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted bacterium that causes a variety of diseases in humans and animals. It is an obligate intracellular pathogen that targets epithelial cells and has a unique biphasic developmental cycle. To survive and replicate within host cells, Chlamydia secretes a variety of effector proteins that subvert host defense mechanisms. In this study, we identified a SET domain containing protein, CT737, that is secreted by Chlamydia and translocated to the host cell nucleus. We found that CT737 has enzymatic activity as a histone methyltransferase that targets histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself. Mutants deficient in automethylation demonstrated diminished activity towards histones, suggesting automethylation functions to enhance enzymatic activity. This is the first description of a bacterial effector that directly targets mammalian histones. Our findings suggest that CT737 may play a role in regulating host gene expression during Chlamydia infection.
 We investigated the role of recessive genetic effects on height by analyzing inbreeding depression in over 35,000 people from 21 different population samples. We found a highly significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity, equivalent to a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared with the offspring of unrelated individuals. The effect was significant after controlling for socio-economic status. There was, however, a high degree of heterogeneity among populations, with the direction of the effect consistent across most population samples but the effect size differing significantly among populations. These results predict that multiple, rare, recessive variants influence human height. The methodology developed is generally applicable to heritable quantitative traits, paving the way for an investigation into inbreeding effects and genetic architecture on a range of quantitative traits of biomedical importance.
 Monocytes ( MO ) are a type of white blood cell that play an important role in the innate immune response to infections. We found that the phenotype and function of MO from patients with acute uncomplicated malaria differed significantly from those of healthy malaria-exposed individuals. We identified two distinct subgroups of patients based on the expression of two chemokine receptors, CCR2 and CX3CR1, on the CD14high ( hi ) MO subset. The two subgroups differed significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth through the antibody-dependent cellular inhibition ( ADCI ) mechanism. The highest levels of ADCI activity were observed in the group of patients with the highest percentages and absolute numbers of CD14hiCCR2+CX3CR1+ MO. These results suggest that discrete MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity.
 The study aimed to investigate the association between Schistosoma mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility in Ugandan men. The study found that S . mansoni infection was associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible Th17, Th1, and Th22 cell subsets in the blood, but not in the foreskin. These immune alterations were not likely to increase HIV susceptibility in the foreskin. The study suggests that immune activation from infections of the gastrointestinal mucosa may translate into genital immune alterations through the common mucosal immune system. This may explain why HIV disproportionately affects fishing communities in SSA, where helminthic infections are very common. The study highlights the importance of considering the role of non-genital infections in HIV susceptibility and the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the association between S . mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility.
 The mutualistic relationship between filarial nematodes and Wolbachia bacteria has been exploited as a novel approach to the treatment of filarial diseases. Wolbachia depletion leads to an arrested development of larval and embryonic stages resulting in permanent sterilization of adult female worms. However, the reason why depletion of Wolbachia leads to these anti-filarial outcomes is unknown. Here, we have used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the consequences of Wolbachia depletion on host nematode cellular and nuclear structure. Our observations reveal an extensive and profound development of apoptosis in germline cells and embryos following antibiotic depletion of Wolbachia, which occurs soon after bacterial depletion in B. malayi and is sustained for at least 21 months in O. volvulus. We find extensive apoptosis even in cells that had not been infected with Wolbachia prior to antibiotic treatment. Nuclear structure in most somatic tissues remains intact, although disruption of cytoskeleton arrangement occurs in the lateral chord cells, where the vast majority of the bacteria reside. Our observations provide a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.
 The malaria-causing blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum requires pantothenate for proliferation. The parasite converts pantothenate into coenzyme A ( CoA ) via five enzymes, the first being a pantothenate kinase ( PfPanK ). Multiple antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, including pantothenol and CJ-15 , 801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA biosynthesis/utilisation. However, the exact mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. In this study, we show that parasites pressured with pantothenol or CJ-15 , 801 become resistant to these analogues. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one of two putative PanK genes ( Pfpank1 ) in each resistant line. These mutations significantly alter PfPanK activity, with two conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pfpank1 coding for a functional PanK that is essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibit a different sensitivity profile to recently-described, potent, antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. We provide evidence consistent with different pantothenate analogue classes having different mechanisms of action: some inhibit CoA biosynthesis while others inhibit CoA-utilising enzymes. Our study provides genetic evidence validating the importance of the metabolic activation of pantothenate analogues in the antiplasmodial activity of these compounds.
 The PR interval on the electrocardiogram reflects the time it takes for an electrical signal to travel from the atria to the ventricles of the heart. The PR interval is heritable, provides important information about arrhythmia risk, and has been suggested to differ among human races. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified common genetic determinants of the PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, but there is a general paucity of GWA studies in individuals of African ancestry. We performed GWA studies in African American individuals from four cohorts to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration. We observed a strong signal within the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) with genome-wide significant association in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans. This SNP was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size and variability explained. Further meta-analysis of the four cohorts identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5 that were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian GWA studies. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.
 Tomato mosaic virus ( ToMV ) is a positive-strand RNA virus that infects tomato plants. ToMV replicates its genomic RNA in replication complexes formed on intracellular membranes. Previous studies showed that a host seven-pass transmembrane protein TOM1 is necessary for efficient ToMV multiplication. Here, we show that a small GTP-binding protein ARL8, along with TOM1, is co-purified with a FLAG epitope-tagged ToMV 180K replication protein from solubilized membranes of ToMV-infected tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) cells. When solubilized membranes of ToMV-infected tobacco cells that expressed FLAG-tagged ARL8 were subjected to immunopurification with anti-FLAG antibody, ToMV 130K and 180K replication proteins and TOM1 were co-purified and the purified fraction showed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that transcribed ToMV RNA. From uninfected cells, TOM1 co-purified with FLAG-tagged ARL8 less efficiently, suggesting that a complex containing ToMV replication proteins, TOM1, and ARL8 are formed on membranes in infected cells. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ARL8 consists of four family members. Simultaneous mutations in two specific ARL8 genes completely inhibited tobamovirus multiplication. In an in vitro ToMV RNA translation-replication system, the lack of either TOM1 or ARL8 proteins inhibited the production of replicative-form RNA, indicating that TOM1 and ARL8 are required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis. When ToMV 130K protein was co-expressed with TOM1 and ARL8 in yeast, RNA 5′-capping activity was detected in the membrane fraction. This activity was undetectable or very weak when the 130K protein was expressed alone or with either TOM1 or ARL8. Taken together, these results suggest that TOM1 and ARL8 are components of ToMV RNA replication complexes and play crucial roles in a process toward activation of the replication proteins' RNA synthesizing and capping functions.
 Inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in many brain systems. Despite differences in the anatomy or functions of neuronal circuits containing inhibition, two basic motifs repeatedly emerge: feed-forward and feedback. In the locust, it was proposed that a subset of lateral horn interneurons (LHNs) provide feed-forward inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing, a property critical for olfactory learning and memory. However, recently it was established that a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), is the main and perhaps sole source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and that inhibition from this cell is mediated by a feedback (FB) loop including KCs and the GGN. To clarify basic differences in the effects of feedback vs. feed-forward inhibition in circuit dynamics, we here use a model of the locust olfactory system. We found that both inhibitory motifs were able to maintain sparse KCs responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, we further found that only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with data recorded in vivo. These findings describe general rules for feed-forward versus feedback inhibition and suggest that the GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs. A better understanding of how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity could be used to reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.
Rabies is a fatal disease caused by the rabies virus, which is transmitted to humans through bites from infected animals. The current diagnostic method for rabies is based on direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation, but molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are increasingly being used. However, these methods have not been able to detect all lyssavirus species due to their genetic diversity. We developed a dual combined real-time reverse transcription PCR (combo RT-qPCR) method for pan-lyssavirus detection. This method uses two complementary technologies: a probe-based (TaqMan) RT-qPCR for detecting the RABV species (pan-RABV RT-qPCR) and a second reaction using an intercalating dye (SYBR Green) to detect other lyssavirus species (pan-lyssa RT-qPCR). The performance parameters of this combined assay were evaluated with a large panel of primary animal samples covering almost all the genetic variability encountered at the viral species level, and they extended to almost all lyssavirus species characterized to date. This method was also evaluated for the diagnosis of human rabies on 211 biological samples (positive n = 76 and negative n = 135) including saliva, skin, and brain biopsies. It detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested and confirmed the sensitivity and the interest of skin biopsy (91.5%) and saliva (54%) samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. Finally, this method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). This combined RT-qPCR method constitutes a relevant, useful, validated tool for the diagnosis of rabies in both humans and animals, and represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance.
 The tsetse fly is a major pest in Africa that transmits trypanosomiasis to humans and livestock, leading to significant economic losses and poverty. In Ghana, an outbreak of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis caused more than 50% losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region. To control the tsetse population, insecticide-treated mosquito fences were installed around pigsties in an experimental village. The fences were attached to surrounding timber poles and planks and treated with deltamethrin and a UV protector. Bi-monthly monitoring of tsetse densities with geo-referenced bi-conical traps showed a reduction of more than 90% in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% recorded during subsequent months. The tsetse population in the control village was not affected, only displaying seasonal variations. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and given a single curative treatment with diminazene aceturate. The initial trypanosome prevalence amounted to 76% and 72% of protected and control animals, respectively, and decreased to 16% in protected as opposed to 84% in control pigs three months after intervention. After six months, 8% of the protected pigs were infected, contrasting with 60% in the control group. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling the tsetse population and reducing the risk of trypanosome infections in pigs.
 The scientific community has been increasingly concerned about the lack of reproducibility and transparency in research. To address this issue, there has been a growing movement to encourage researchers to share their protocols, raw data, and funding sources. In this study, we randomly selected 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014 and assessed their compliance with these indicators. We found that only one study provided a full protocol, none made all raw data directly available, and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. The percentage of articles with no statement of conflict decreased substantially between 2000 and 2014, while the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts or no conflicts increased. Articles published in journals in the clinical medicine category were almost twice as likely to not include any information on funding and to have private funding. This study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving these indicators in the scientific literature.
 Yersinia pestis is a highly lethal bacterium that causes primary pneumonic plague, a syndrome with mortality rates approaching 100%. The disease progresses in two phases: an initial pre-inflammatory phase with rapid bacterial replication in the absence of host innate immune responses, followed by a pro-inflammatory phase marked by extensive neutrophil influx, a massive pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, and severe tissue destruction. In this study, we used a FRET-based probe to quantitate injection of effector proteins by the Y . pestis type III secretion system and showed that these bacteria target alveolar macrophages early during infection of mice, followed by a switch in host cell preference to neutrophils. We also demonstrated that neutrophil influx is unable to limit bacterial growth in the lung and is ultimately responsible for the severe inflammation during the lethal pro-inflammatory phase. Our findings provide insight into the dynamic events occurring shortly after pulmonary exposure to the highly lethal pathogen Y . pestis .
 The study aimed to evaluate the performance of serology to identify asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) infection in participants selected from a cohort with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples were collected in 2001 from 136 cohort participants (97 positive and 39 negatives, PCR/hybridization carried out in 1999) who were clinically evaluated and none had progressed to disease from their asymptomatic state. Two molecular biology techniques (reference tests) were performed: PCR with Leishmania-generic primer followed by hybridization using L. infantum probe, and PCR with specific primer to L. donovani complex. Plasma samples were tested by ELISA using three different antigens: L. infantum and L. amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. Accuracy of the serological tests was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, and ROC curve. The presence of Leishmania was confirmed by molecular techniques in all kala-azar patients and in 117 (86%) of the 136 cohort participants. Kala-azar patients showed high reactivity in ELISAs, whereas asymptomatic individuals presented low reactivity against the antigens tested. When compared to molecular techniques, the L. amazonensis and L. infantum antigens showed higher sensitivity (49.6% and 41%, respectively) than rK39 (26.5%), but the specificity of rK39 was higher (73.7%) than L. amazonensis (52.6%) and L. infantum antigens (36.8%). Moreover, there was low agreement among the different antigens used (kappa<0.10). Serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, which could lead to misclassification bias in population studies. Therefore, studies which have used serological assays to estimate prevalence, to evaluate intervention programs, or to identify risk factors for Leishmania infection, may have had their results compromised.
 Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that can amplify in pluripotent cells or developing germ cells. Host mechanisms that silence retrotransposons in germ cells and pluripotent cells are important for limiting the accumulation of repetitive elements in the genome during evolution. Here we show that cryptic repetitive element probes present in Illumina and Affymetrix gene expression microarray platforms can accurately and sensitively monitor repetitive element expression data. This computational approach to genome-wide retrotransposon expression has allowed us to identify the histone deacetylase Hdac1 as a component of the retrotransposon silencing machinery in mouse embryonic stem cells, and to determine the retrotransposon targets of Hdac1 in these cells. We also identify retrotransposons that are targets of other retrotransposon silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, Eset-mediated histone modification, and Ring1B/Eed-containing polycomb repressive complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, our computational analysis of retrotransposon silencing suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells, that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms, and helps define retrotransposon sequence elements that are targeted by silencing machineries. Thus, repeat annotation of gene expression microarray data suggests that a complex interplay between silencing mechanisms represses retrotransposon loci in germ cells and embryonic stem cells.
 The Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 ( CRY2 ) mediates light control of flowering time . CIB1 ( CRY2-interacting bHLH 1 ) specifically interacts with CRY2 in response to blue light to activate the transcription of FT ( Flowering Locus T ) . In vitro , CIB1 binds to the canonical E-box ( CACGTG , also referred to as G-box ) with much higher affinity than its interaction with non-canonical E-box ( CANNTG ) DNA sequences . However , in vivo , CIB1 binds to the chromatin region of the FT promoter , which only contains the non-canonical E-boxes. Here , we show that CRY2 also interacts with at least CIB5 , in response to blue light , but not in darkness or in response to other wavelengths of light . Our genetic analysis demonstrates that CIB1 , CIB2 , CIB4 , and CIB5 act redundantly to activate the transcription of FT and that they are positive regulators of CRY2 mediated flowering . More importantly , CIB1 and other CIBs proteins form heterodimers , and some of the heterodimers have a higher binding affinity than the CIB homodimers to the non-canonical E-box in the in vitro DNA-binding assays . This result explains why in vitro CIB1 and other CIBs bind to the canonical E-box ( G-box ) with a higher affinity , whereas they are all associated with the non-canonical E-boxes at the FT promoter in vivo . Consistent with the hypothesis that different CIBs play similar roles in the CRY2-midiated blue light signaling , the expression of CIB proteins is regulated specifically by blue light . Our study demonstrates that CIBs function redundantly in regulating CRY2-dependent flowering , and that different CIBs form heterodimers to interact with the non-canonical E-box DNA in vivo .
 Intestinal parasites are common in refugees from countries where they are endemic. These parasites can be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed in the United States, leading to potentially serious consequences. This study evaluated the costs and benefits of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 U.S.-bound Asian refugees: 1) "No Program," 2) "Domestic Screening and Treatment," 3) "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" presumptive treatment, and 4) "Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides." The "No Program" option is the least expensive but least effective option. The "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" option is less expensive than "Domestic Screening and Treatment" or "Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides." According to the model outcomes, "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" is the most effective treatment option, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by around 80%. Overseas presumptive treatment for U.S.-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole reduces the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the probability of rare but potentially fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a popular model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions. In this study, the authors discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite of C. elegans that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites. The new species, Nematocida displodere, can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine. Despite robust invasion of the intestine, very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. The authors compared the N. displodere genome with two closely related microsporidian pathogens and found that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function that may be mediating interactions with the host. This system provides a powerful whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches.
 The Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein is essential for transcription-coupled DNA repair and is associated with Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease with complex clinical features. CSB belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 ATP–dependent chromatin remodeler family, but the extent to which CSB remodels chromatin and whether this activity is utilized in DNA repair is unknown. In this study, the authors show that CSB repositions nucleosomes in an ATP–dependent manner in vitro and that this activity is greatly enhanced by the NAP1-like histone chaperones, which they identify as new CSB–binding partners. By mapping functional domains and analyzing CSB derivatives, the authors demonstrate that chromatin remodeling by the combined activities of CSB and the NAP1-like chaperones is required for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. The collaboration that the authors observed between CSB and the NAP1-like histone chaperones adds a new dimension to our understanding of the ways in which ATP–dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones can regulate chromatin structure. Taken together, the results of this study offer new insights into the functions of chromatin remodeling by CSB in transcription-coupled DNA repair as well as the underlying mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome.
 Epigenetic variation, such as DNA methylation, is a type of genetic variation that occurs among humans. While previous studies have identified some epigenetic variation that is highly heritable, others have shown that a subset of methylation variation exhibits low heritability. In this study, we used population data derived from five different human cell types to identify regions of common epigenetic variation, termed variably methylated regions (VMRs). We found that VMRs co-localize with other functional genomic features, are enriched for CpGs that influence gene expression, and provide evidence that epigenetic variability at some of these loci is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. We also found that VMRs form cis and trans co-regulated networks enriched for transcription factor binding sites and genes with cell-type relevant functions. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated environmental effects on methylation at VMRs using cultured fibroblasts, revealing signatures that overlap those observed in our population-level datasets. Our results provide novel insights into the biology of variable methylation across the human genome.
 Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that affects millions of people worldwide. The current diagnostic tests for dengue rely on detecting antibodies or viral RNA. However, these tests have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. A new test called the Dengue Early Rapid test has been developed to detect the dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen, which is present in the blood during the early stages of infection. The test was evaluated in two separate studies in Vietnam and Malaysia. The results showed that the test had high sensitivity and specificity when used alone or in combination with an IgM/IgG rapid test. The test can detect dengue infection earlier than antibody-based tests, which can improve patient outcomes. The test can also be used to differentiate between primary and secondary infections. Overall, the Dengue Early Rapid test is a promising new tool for the diagnosis of dengue infection.

 The plant immune system is a complex network of interacting genes and proteins that protect plants from pathogens. To understand how this network functions, researchers have used a "network reconstitution" approach, in which they disassemble and then reassemble the network step by step. This approach has revealed that many of the interactions in the plant immune network are not detectable by traditional genetic analysis, and that the network is highly buffered, meaning that it can function even when some of its components are disabled. This buffering may help the plant immune system to resist attacks from pathogens that target and disable specific components of the network. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding how complex biological systems function and how they may be disrupted by pathogens or other environmental factors.
 The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster develops its visual system from an optic placode, which forms in the dorsolateral region of the embryonic head ectoderm. During embryogenesis, neuroepithelial cells of the optic placode are patterned to form two subdomains: the ventroposterior domain, which gives rise to the larval eye and consists of two photoreceptor (PR) precursor types (primary and secondary), and the dorsal domain, which harbors neuroepithelial precursors that generate the optic lobe of the adult visual system. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Atonal (Ato) promotes PR precursor cell fate in the larval eye primordium, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless (Tll) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch (N) signaling act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. In a second step, Notch signaling controls a binary cell fate decision, thus, acts at the top of a cascade of transcription factor interactions to define PR subtype identity. Our model serves as an example of how combinatorial action of cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic factors control neural tissue patterning.
β-defensins are antimicrobial peptides that play an important role in innate immunity. Human β-defensin 1 (hBD1) is ubiquitously expressed and has distinct antimicrobial activities between its oxidized and reduced forms. In this study, we explored the antimicrobial mechanisms of hBD1. We found that hBD1red forms net-like structures around bacteria, which inhibit bacterial transmigration independent of bacterial killing. The presence of these nets could completely prevent migration of hBD1 resistant pathogens. These redox-dependent functions serve as an additional mechanism of action for hBD1 and differ from net formation by other defensins such as Paneth cell-derived human α-defensin 6 (HD6). While hBD1red and hBD1ox have distinct antimicrobial profiles and functions, only the reduced form provides additional host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures preventing bacterial invasion. Better understanding of the modes of action of endogenous host peptides will help to find new antimicrobial strategies.
 Our study shows that OCRL1 is required for efficient endocytosis in vivo in the zebrafish pronephric tubule, a model for the mammalian renal tubule. We found that OCRL1-deficient embryos exhibit a mild ciliogenesis defect, but this cannot account for the observed impairment of endocytosis. Our results reveal PIP5K as a potential therapeutic target for Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease.
 Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects both humans and livestock. It is endemic in parts of Africa and has been reported in recent years during inter-epidemic periods. A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected cattle, sheep, and goats in the Kilombero river valley in southern Tanzania from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Tanzania. An overall seroprevalence of 11.3% was recorded, with a linear increase in prevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVFV IgM antibodies, indicating a recent infection. The spatial distribution of seroprevalence exhibited a few hotspots. Species, breed, herd composition, grazing practices, and altitude were not associated with seropositivity. These findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the study area. The linear increase in seroprevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts implies a constant exposure and presence of active foci transmission preceding the survey.
 Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite that causes Chagas disease. It has a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) that helps it regulate its osmolarity. The CVC also helps in the transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane. In this study, the authors used genetic and biochemical approaches to delineate the contribution of the CVC to the transport of GPI-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane and promote host invasion. They found that TcRab11, a GTPase that localizes to the CVC, plays a role in the transport of GPI-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane. The authors also found that dominant-interfering TcRab11 mutants altered the morphology, osmoregulation, and infectivity of the parasite. These results suggest a novel unconventional mechanism of GPI-anchored protein transport to the cell surface of eukaryotic cells.
 This study compares the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen, compared with the currently recommended 2-site/Thai Red Cross ( TRC ) regimen. The study enrolled healthy individuals ≥1 year of age, randomized into 4 groups to receive intradermal PCECV according to one of the 2 regimens, with or without human rabies immunoglobulin ( HRIG ) administration at first visit ( in adults only ). The study demonstrated non-inferiority of the 4-site/1-week regimen to the 2-site/TRC regimen if at D49, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval ( CI ) for the difference between groups in the percentage of participants with adequate rabies virus neutralizing antibody ( RVNA ) concentrations was >-5%. The study suggests that the 4-site/1-week regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, with potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination.
The salience network ( SN ) is a crucial brain network that detects and attends to salient events in a flexible manner. In this study, we used high temporal-resolution fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN. We found that the SN has several distinctive and robust properties, including high temporal flexibility, high spatial variability, and high centrality. These properties suggest that the SN is uniquely positioned to facilitate interactions with multiple functional systems and support a wide range of cognitive processes. Our findings provide fundamental new insights into the distinct dynamic functional architecture of the SN and demonstrate how this network is uniquely positioned to support flexible cognitive behaviors.
 The release of nonenveloped viruses from host cells is a critical step in the viral life cycle. However, the mechanism of nonenveloped viral release is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of a late expressed protein, VP4, in the release of the nonenveloped virus SV40. We found that VP4 binds and disrupts cellular membranes, leading to the release of SV40 viral particles. Our findings suggest that VP4 plays a central role in the release of nonenveloped viruses from host cells.
 Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne disease that causes severe flu-like symptoms in humans and is a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, there is no antiviral treatment or vaccine available for DENV. In this study, we investigated the immune response elicited by a DNA vaccine containing the signal peptide sequence from human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) fused to the DENV2 NS1 gene (pcTPANS1). We found that pcTPANS1 induced a robust protection against DENV infection in mice, which was characterized by anti-NS1 specific antibodies and T cell responses. Our results suggest that cooperation between CD4+ T cells and the humoral response plays a critical role in the protection against DENV mediated by the NS1 antigen. These findings provide new insights into the immune response to DENV and may have implications for vaccine development.
 In this study, the authors elucidate the structure-function relationship of ComR, a new member of the RNPP family, which positively controls competence for natural DNA transformation in streptococci. ComR is directly activated by the binding of its associated pheromone XIP, the mature form of the comX/sigX-inducing-peptide ComS. The crystal structure analysis of ComR from Streptococcus thermophilus combined with a mutational analysis and in vivo assays allows the authors to propose an original molecular mechanism of the ComR regulation mode. XIP-binding induces release of the sequestered HTH domain and ComR dimerization to allow DNA binding. Importantly, the authors bring evidence that this activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, demonstrating that ComR is not an Rgg protein as initially proposed, but instead constitutes a new member of the RNPP family. In addition, identification of XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation constitutes a crucial step towards the design of antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptococci.
 The pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC has recently provided first insight into the architecture of the family at high resolution . However, its detailed investigation was so far prevented by the fact that activating ligands were unknown . Here we describe a study on the functional characterization of ELIC by electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography . ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines that include the neurotransmitter GABA at high micro- to millimolar concentrations . The ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time . The protein forms cation selective channels with properties that resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor . The high single channel conductance and the comparably simple functional behavior make ELIC an attractive model system to study general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors .
 Asthma is a common allergic lung disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The link between asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD), a skin condition characterized by itchy, red rashes, is well-established. However, the mechanism by which AD progresses to asthma is unclear. In this study, the authors used mice with skin-barrier defects to model AD and found that these mice developed allergic inflammation in the skin and lungs. They also found that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine produced by skin keratinocytes, was the systemic driver of allergic inflammation in the lungs. The authors propose that TSLP may be a potential therapeutic target for preventing asthma in AD patients.
 The generation of genome-scale data is becoming more routine, but the subsequent analysis of omics data remains a significant challenge. Here, an approach that integrates multiple omics datasets with bioinformatics tools was developed to produce a detailed annotation of several microbial genomic features. This methodology was used to characterize the genome of Thermotoga maritima, a deep-branching, hyperthermophilic bacterium. Experimental data were generated for whole-genome resequencing, transcription start site determination, transcriptome profiling, and proteome profiling. These datasets, analyzed in combination with bioinformatics tools, served as a basis for the improvement of gene annotation, the elucidation of transcription units, the identification of putative non-coding RNAs, and the determination of promoters and ribosome binding sites. This revealed many distinctive properties of the T . maritima genome organization relative to other bacteria. These distinctive properties are hypothesized to be a reflection of this organism's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and could yield novel insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on earth.
 We study how contextual inputs influence the perception of a target bar in a yes–no task. We found that weak contextual bars bias the observers to perceive a target bar, while high-contrast contextual bars bias the observers to perceive no target bar. A Bayesian model of visual inference is shown to account for the data well, suggesting that the context influences the perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. Our data suggest that the contextual influences are not due to colinear facilitation of input sensitivities, and the neural substrate responsible for this inference is more likely beyond V1.
 Cooperation is a widespread phenomenon in nature, but it is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors who enjoy a fitness advantage by consuming the common good without contributing fairly. In this study, we used an individual-based approach to model stochastic birth, death, migration, and mutation events in a structured population. We found that defectors can sometimes rescue cooperation by creating small population sizes that increase variability in cooperator frequency across different locations. This allows cooperators to grow more than defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location. We also found that resource limitation, inducible by defectors, can select for mutations adaptive to resource limitation. When these mutations are initially present at low levels or continuously generated at a moderate rate, they can further reduce local population size and favor cooperation. Our results suggest that in a structured population, small population sizes precipitated by defectors provide a “built-in” mechanism for the persistence of cooperation.
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic pathogen that causes infections in people with weakened immune systems. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa binds to and is internalized by epithelial cells through a process called efferocytosis. This process involves the engulfment of apoptotic cells by surrounding epithelial cells, which then dispose of the apoptotic cells. We also found that P. aeruginosa is eliminated from epithelial cells after 24 hours. These findings suggest that efferocytosis is a host defense mechanism against P. aeruginosa infections.
 The Drosophila embryonic gonad is assembled from two distinct cell types, the Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and the Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells (SGPs). The PGCs form at the posterior of blastoderm stage embryos and are subsequently carried inside the embryo during gastrulation. To reach the SGPs, the PGCs must traverse the midgut wall and then migrate through the mesoderm. A combination of local repulsive cues and attractive signals emanating from the SGPs guide migration. We have investigated the role of the hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) in directing PGC migration. shf encodes a secreted protein that facilitates the long distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix after it is released from basolateral membranes of Hh expressing cells in the wing imaginal disc. shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm, and loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that it is required for PGC migration. Previous studies have established that the hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in generating the PGC attractant both by the SGPs and by other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. We show that production of this PGC attractant depends upon shf as well as a second hh pathway gene gγ1. Furthermore, we present evidence indicating that ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release/transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into and through the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. Finally, potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend upon cholesterol modification.
 HIV vaccines have been developed to induce an immune response against HIV infection. However, the immune response induced by these vaccines has not been sufficient to prevent HIV infection. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in recipients of a replication incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 recombinant vaccine. We found that the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in vaccinees was relatively low and comparable to that of progressors. However, the highest responses were observed in those with the protective HLA class I alleles B*57, B*58, and B*27. These findings suggest that protective HLA class I alleles have an effect on the cytotoxic capacity induced by vaccination that is mediated during T-cell priming.
 The ability to share intentions is a key feature of human cognition and behavior. In this study, we model the coevolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, showing that rapid techno-cultural advance goes hand in hand with the emergence of the ability to participate in jointly intentional behavior. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant techno-cultural improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. Thus, we provide a unified mechanism for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior.
 Spermatogenesis is a complex process that produces spermatozoa, which are essential for fertility. The process involves three stages: mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During meiosis and spermiogenesis, gene expression is mostly inactive, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in these stages. One such post-transcriptional regulator is microRNA (miRNA), which is a small non-coding RNA that negatively regulates gene expression. In this study, the authors found that the miR-34 family is highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and is essential for spermatogenesis. Deletion of the miR-34 family resulted in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by a reduced number, motility, and morphology of spermatozoa. The authors also found that the miR-34 family regulates several genes involved in meiosis and spermiogenesis. Their findings suggest that the miR-34 family plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis and that its deregulation can lead to infertility.
 Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 ( EcN ) is a probiotic strain that has been used therapeutically for over a century. It produces two siderophore-microcins ( Mcc ) that are responsible for its antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteriaceae. EcN also synthesizes the genotoxin colibactin encoded by the pks island. The pks-encoded ClbP, the peptidase that activates colibactin, is required for the antagonistic activity of EcN. The analysis of a series of ClbP mutants revealed that this activity is linked to the transmembrane helices of ClbP and not the periplasmic peptidase domain. A single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivates the genotoxic activity but maintains the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this point mutant reduced the clinical signs and the fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild type strain, whereas the clbP deletion mutant could neither protect nor outcompete the pathogen. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in vitro with other E . coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. In such strains, siderophore-Mcc synthesis also required the glucosyltransferase IroB involved in salmochelin production. This interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E . coli from phylogroup B2. This co-evolution observed in EcN illustrates the fine margin between pathogenicity and probiotic activity and the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of probiotics. Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity by specifically inactivating ClbP peptidase domain opens the way to the safe use of EcN.
 Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes meningitis in people with weakened immune systems. The fungus produces a polysaccharide capsule that is composed of two complex polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and glucuronoxylomannanogalactan (GXMGal). The capsule is made up of mannose, glucuronic acid, and xylose. The fungus also produces proteins with N- and O-linked glycans that are modified with xylose or xylose-phosphate residues. To make these glycans, the fungus needs nucleotide sugars, which are made in the cytosol and transported into the secretory pathway by nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs). We have identified two NSTs, Uxt1 and Uxt2, that transport UDP-xylose and UDP-galactofuranose. These transporters are required for the incorporation of xylose into the capsule and proteins, and for the fungus to cause disease in mice. However, they are not required for the fungus to survive in the context of infection. These findings provide a starting point for understanding the unique glycan biosynthesis of C. neoformans and for developing new therapies to treat cryptococcal meningitis.
 Neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) are a group of diseases that affect the poorest and marginalized populations in the developing world. Despite their high prevalence rates, NTDs receive less visibility and lower priorities compared to other diseases. Efforts are underway to control or eliminate some of the NTDs, including schistosomiasis, through preventive chemotherapy. However, there is a paucity of empirical estimates regarding the distribution of infection risk and burden of NTDs at the national, district, or sub-district level in most parts of the developing world. An open-access georeferenced database for NTDs is important to identify areas with no information on disease burden, to foster geographical modeling over time and space, and to control and monitor NTDs. In this manuscript, we describe the steps taken toward the development of such a database, which is currently expanded to a global scale and includes other NTDs. The database provides the actual data and can be constantly updated based on new publications and reports, as well as field data provided by contributors.
Tuberculosis (TB) and helminth infections are common worldwide, and often co-exist. Chronic helminth infections induce a Th2 immune response, which can suppress the Th1 immune response necessary for controlling TB. We hypothesized that chronic helminth infections may exacerbate TB infection. To test this hypothesis, we used the cotton rat model, which is a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis and an excellent model for human TB. We found that chronic L. sigmodontis infection did not exacerbate TB infection in the cotton rat model. These findings suggest that chronic helminth infections may not impair the development of a protective immune response against TB.
 Insects use diverse families of ion channels to respond to environmental cues and control behaviors such as mating, feeding, and response to threats. Although degenerin/epithelial sodium channels (DEG/ENaC) represent one of the largest families of ion channels in Drosophila melanogaster, the physiological functions of these proteins are still poorly understood. We found that the DEG/ENaC channel ppk23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles that are distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting activity of ppk23-expressing neurons did not alter gustatory responses. Instead, blocking ppk23-positive neurons or mutating the ppk23 gene delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship. Furthermore, mutations in ppk23 altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7 (Z), 11 (Z)-Heptacosadiene. Together, these data indicate that ppk23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila.
 The study investigates the relationship between mitochondrial codon usage and the import of cytosolic tRNAs in the green alga Chlamydomonas. The authors found a correlation between the mitochondrial codon usage and the nature and amount of imported tRNAs. They also found that the mitochondrial import of cytosolic tRNAs cannot be rapidly regulated in response to a novel genetic context, suggesting that the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutive adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. The study provides important insights into the regulation of mitochondrial translation and the role of tRNA import in this process.
 Diabetes is a major health problem worldwide, affecting millions of people. Current methods for diagnosing diabetes rely on single-time-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. We used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to evaluate the frequency and types of patterns of glycemic responses to standardized meals. We developed an analytical framework that can group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses called "glucotypes" that reveal heterogeneity within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. We found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. We developed a model for identifying potential mechanisms of personal glucose dysregulation and built a webtool for visualizing a user-uploaded CGM profile and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes. Our study highlights the personal nature of glucose regulation and the importance of personalized nutrition recommendations in controlling glucose dysregulation.
 Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) cascades are important signaling pathways that regulate plant defense against pathogens . The Raf-like MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAPKKK ) EDR1 negatively regulates plant defense and cell death . Here , we found that EDR1 negatively regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in Arabidopsis . We also found that EDR1 physically interacts with MKK4 and MKK5 and negatively affects their protein levels . In addition , we found that the mkk4 and mkk5 mutations suppress edr1-mediated resistance and that over-expression of MKK4 or MKK5 causes edr1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death . Taken together , our data indicate that EDR1 physically associates with MKK4/MKK5 and negatively regulates the MAPK cascade to fine-tune plant innate immunity .
 Infectious diseases are a major public health problem worldwide, leading to millions of deaths annually. To develop effective control and prevention strategies, we need reliable computational tools to understand disease dynamics and predict future cases. In this study, we developed a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases and exploited the special structure of similarity matrices in our formulation to obtain a very efficient implementation. We then tested our framework on the problem of modeling Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever cases between years 2004 and 2015 in Turkey. We showed that our Gaussian process formulation obtained better results than two frequently used standard machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forests and boosted regression trees) under temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios. These results showed that our framework has the potential to make an important contribution to public health policy makers.
 Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects humans and livestock. It is endemic in Africa and the Middle East and causes significant economic losses due to the death of livestock. Outbreaks of RVF are sporadic and associated with both seasonal and socioeconomic factors. In this study, we propose a mathematical model to investigate the transmission dynamics of RVF virus among ruminants with spatial movements. Our findings indicate that the disease is driven by a combination of climatic factors such as rainfall level and hydrological variations, and human activities such as the Eid al Adha feast and livestock movement. We show that sporadic outbreaks may occur when the two events occur together: abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk from RVF due to the demand for the religious festival and abundant mosquitoes emerge. Our numerical results present the transmission dynamics of the disease over both short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival time. We also investigate the impact on patterns of disease outbreaks in each patch brought by festival- and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, the animal transportation speed from patch to patch, and the death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices. In addition, our simulations show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in patch 3 (the place where the religious ceremony will be held).
 We assessed the spatial and temporal changes in the occurrence of human anthrax in Azerbaijan during 1984 through 2010 . Our findings revealed that the incidence of human anthrax increased from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline from 1996 to 2010. The distribution of human anthrax shifted from the west to the east over the study period. Despite decreases in the incidence of human anthrax, continued control measures in livestock are needed to mitigate its occurrence. Our study highlights the need for an integrated "One Health" approach that takes into account the changing geographic distribution of the disease.
 Voltage-gated potassium ( KV ) channels are membrane proteins that respond to changes in membrane potential by enabling K+ ion flux across the membrane . Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) induce channel opening by modulating the voltage-sensitivity , which can provide effective treatment against refractory epilepsy by means of a ketogenic diet . While PUFAs have been reported to influence the gating mechanism by electrostatic interactions to the voltage-sensor domain ( VSD ) , the exact PUFA-protein interactions are still elusive . In this study , we report on the interactions between the Shaker KV channel in open and closed states and a PUFA-enriched lipid bilayer using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations . We determined a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the channel located at the protein-lipid interface in the vicinity of the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the VSD . In particular , the lipophilic PUFA tail covered a wide range of non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface , while the carboxylic head group displayed more specific interactions to polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices , encompassing the S3-S4 linker . Moreover , by studying the interactions between saturated fatty acids ( SFA ) and the Shaker KV channel , our study confirmed an increased conformational flexibility in the polyunsaturated carbon tails compared to saturated carbon chains , which may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins .
 The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum causes significant disease burden among children in developing countries and can result in chronic and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. The currently available drugs lack efficacy in treating these severe conditions. The discovery and development of novel anti-cryptosporidial therapeutics has been hampered by the poor experimental tractability of this pathogen. Here we have developed a pipeline of tools to accelerate the in vivo screening of inhibitors of C . parvum IMPDH. We have genetically engineered the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii to serve as a model of C . parvum infection as the first screen. This assay provides crucial target validation and a large signal window that is currently not possible in assays involving C . parvum. To further develop compounds that pass this first filter, we established a fluorescence-based assay of host cell proliferation and a C . parvum growth assay that utilizes automated high-content imaging analysis for enhanced throughput. We have used these assays to evaluate C . parvum IMPDH inhibitors emerging from our ongoing medicinal chemistry effort and have identified a subset of 1, 2, 3-triazole ethers that exhibit excellent in vivo selectivity in the T . gondii model and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity.
 Tooth development is a highly heritable process that is linked to other growth and developmental processes. Abnormalities of tooth development are common, with tooth agenesis being the most common developmental anomaly in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study of time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year in 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We identified 5 loci at P<5×10−8 and 5 with suggestive association (P<5×10−6). The loci included several genes with links to tooth and other organ development, including KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, and MSRB3. Genes at four of the identified loci are implicated in the development of cancer. A variant within the HOXB gene cluster associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31 years.
 Trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) causes Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition characterized by intellectual disability, delayed motor development, and hypotonia. To investigate the role of Hsa21 genes in these phenotypes, we generated two new mouse models: Ts3Yah, which carries a tandem duplication of the Hspa13-App interval, and Ms3Yah, which carries a deletion of this interval. Both models display locomotor deficits, but in opposite directions. Ts3Yah mice have increased grip strength, muscle mass, and mitochondrial content, while Ms3Yah mice have decreased grip strength, muscle mass, and mitochondrial content. Transcriptional profiling of skeletal muscles revealed coordinate changes in genes involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings suggest that Hsa21 genes are involved in the development of DS and M21 phenotypes, and provide new candidate genes for further investigation.
 G protein-gated K+ channels (GIRKs) are important regulators of heartbeat and neuronal excitability and plasticity. Both neurotransmitter-evoked (Ievoked) and neurotransmitter-independent basal (Ibasal) GIRK activities are physiologically important, but the mechanisms of Ibasal and its relation to Ievoked are unclear. We have previously shown for heterologously expressed neuronal GIRK1/2, and now show for native GIRK in hippocampal neurons, that Ibasal and Ievoked are interrelated: the extent of activation by neurotransmitter (activation index, Ra) is inversely related to Ibasal. To unveil the underlying mechanisms, we have developed a quantitative model of GIRK1/2 function. We characterized single-channel and macroscopic GIRK1/2 currents, and surface densities of GIRK1/2 and Gβγ expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Based on experimental results, we constructed a mathematical model of GIRK1/2 activity under steady-state conditions before and after activation by neurotransmitter. Our model accurately recapitulates Ibasal and Ievoked in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons; correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ and fully accounts for the inverse Ibasal-Ra correlation. Modeling indicates that, under all conditions and at different channel expression levels, between 3 and 4 Gβγ but only 2 Gαi/o are available for one GIRK1/2 channel. The unique, unequal association of GIRK1/2 with G protein subunits, and the cooperative nature of Gβγ gating by GIRK1/2, underlie the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities and allow GIRK1/2 to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both Gβγ and Gα. Our analysis suggests a maximal stoichiometry of 4 Gβγ but only 2 Gαi/o per one GIRK1/2 channel.

 We previously developed a computational model for predicting TALE target sequences based on the RVD sequence of a given TALE and the orientation of the target box relative to the transcription start site ( TSS ) of its target gene.  In this study, we propose a novel approach for TALE target prediction, termed PrediTALE, which accounts for recent findings concerning TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths, and the flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the TSS of the downstream target gene.  We benchmarked PrediTALE using RNA-seq data after Xanthomonas infection in rice, and found an overall improvement of prediction performance compared with previous approaches. Using PrediTALE, we were able to predict several novel putative virulence targets. However, we also observed that no target genes were predicted by any prediction tool for several TALEs, which we termed orphan TALEs for this reason. We postulate that one explanation for orphan TALEs are incomplete gene annotations, and hence, propose to replace promoterome-wide by genome-wide scans for target boxes. We demonstrate that known targets from promoterome-wide scans may be recovered by genome-wide scans, whereas the latter, combined with RNA-seq data, are able to detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.
24,189 are all the possible non-synonymous amino acid changes potentially affecting the human mitochondrial DNA. However, only a tiny subset has been functionally evaluated with certainty so far, while the pathogenicity of the vast majority was only assessed in-silico by software predictors. Since these tools proved to be rather incongruent, we have designed and implemented APOGEE, a machine-learning algorithm that outperforms all existing prediction methods in estimating the harmfulness of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations. We provide a detailed description of the underlying algorithm, of the selected and manually curated training and test sets of variants, as well as of its classification ability.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) is the most common mosquito-borne viral infection worldwide, causing a range of diseases from self-limiting dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome . Thrombocytopenia is a major characteristic observed in both mild and severe dengue disease and is significantly correlated with the progression of dengue severity . In this study, the authors demonstrated that DENV nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1 ) can directly induce platelet activation and cause thrombocytopenia during DENV infection . They found that DENV but not Zika virus cell culture supernatant could induce P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) exposure in human platelets, both of which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Similar results were found using recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV, and those effects were blocked in the presence of anti-NS1 F ( ab’ ) 2 , anti-TLR4 antibody , a TLR4 antagonist ( Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide , LPS-Rs ) and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor ( TAK242 ) , but not polymyxin B ( an LPS inhibitor ). Moreover, the activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Finally, the authors demonstrated that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. Taken together, these results suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection.
 We performed a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control loops regulating the vasomotor tone of vascular smooth muscle, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure, which involve the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Our loop analysis revealed the concurrent presence of two different regulatory mechanisms that perform the same qualitative function: one affects blood pressure by regulating vasoconstriction, the other by regulating blood volume. Both systems are candidate oscillators consisting of the negative-feedback loop of a monotone system, and we show that their oscillatory potential is higher when the delays along all feedback loops are comparable. Our results give insight into the physiological mechanisms ruling long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters, which operate based on dynamical loops of interactions.
 Thromboembolic disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide . In the last several years, there have been a number of studies attempting to identify mechanisms that stop thrombus growth. This paper identifies a novel mechanism related to the formation of a fibrin cap. In particular, protein transport through a fibrin network, an important component of a thrombus, was studied by integrating experiments with model simulations. The network permeability and the protein diffusivity were shown to be important factors determining the transport of proteins through the fibrin network. Our previous in vivo studies in mice have shown that stabilized non-occluding thrombi are covered by a fibrin network (‘fibrin cap’). Model simulations, calibrated using experiments in microfluidic devices and accounting for the permeable structure of the fibrin cap, demonstrated that thrombin generated inside the thrombus was washed downstream through the fibrin network, thus limiting exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin. Moreover, by restricting the approach of resting platelets in the flowing blood to the thrombus core, the fibrin cap impaired platelets from reaching regions of high thrombin concentration necessary for platelet activation and limited thrombus growth. The formation of a fibrin cap prevents small thrombi that frequently develop in the absence of major injury in the 60000 km of vessels in the body from developing into life threatening events.
αGalCer is a potent activator of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which are important for host resistance to Mtb infection. However, the role of iNKT cells during infection is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of iNKT cells in controlling Mtb infection. We found that iNKT cells upregulated activation markers and produced IFNγ during Mtb infection, but blocking these cytokine signals had little effect on the ability of iNKT cells to control Mtb growth. In contrast, the antimicrobial function of iNKT cells required CD1d signaling and was mediated by a soluble factor, GM-CSF. Blocking GM-CSF abrogated restriction of bacterial growth by iNKT cells and GM-CSF was sufficient to inhibit mycobacterial growth in vitro. We identified GM-CSF as an antimycobacterial effector molecule produced by iNKT cells with the ability to suppress Mtb infection.
 The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a common component of human intestinal flora . To gain insight into C . albicans colonization , genes expressed by fungi grown within a host were studied . The EFH1 gene , encoding a putative transcription factor , was highly expressed during growth of C . albicans in the intestinal tract . An efh1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract , a model of commensal colonization , whereas an EFH1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and of the oral cavity of athymic mice , the latter situation modeling human mucosal candidiasis . When inoculated into the bloodstream of mice , both efh1 null and EFH1 overexpressing strains caused lethal infections . In contrast , other mutants are attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation but exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization . Finally , although expression of several genes is dependent on transcription factor Efg1p during laboratory growth , Efg1p-independent expression of these genes was observed during growth within the murine intestinal tract . These results show that expression of EFH1 regulated the level of colonizing fungi , favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis . Also , different genes are required in different host niches and the pathway ( s ) that regulates gene expression during host colonization can differ from well-characterized pathways used during laboratory growth .
 The study of immunization with irradiated sporozoites against malaria parasites has shown that the complete development of protective CD8+ T cell responses requires prolonged antigen presentation. Using TCR transgenic cells specific for the malaria circumsporozoite protein, a leading vaccine candidate, the authors found that sporozoite antigen persists for over 8 weeks after immunization. This was detected in lymphoid organs and depends on the presence of CD11c+ cells. Prolonged antigen presentation enhanced the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in a number of ways. Firstly, reducing the time primed CD8+ T cells were exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduced the final size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expanded in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naïve animals. Finally, persisting antigen was able to prime naïve cells, including recent thymic emigrants, to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver. Together these data show that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages is dependent upon the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen.
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The current treatment options are limited and often have side effects. In this study, we investigated the potential of polymyxin B (polB) as a leishmanicidal agent. We found that polB alone had limited activity against Leishmania amazonensis, but when adsorbed onto polybutyl-cyanoacrylate nanoparticles (PBCAnp), it had a significant leishmanicidal effect. Additionally, we found that PBCAnp-polB had antimicrobial activity against several Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common secondary infection in leishmaniasis. Overall, our findings suggest that PBCAnp-polB could be a promising new treatment option for leishmaniasis.
 This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Brazil. The study used data from the Reportable Disease Information System (SINAN) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which collects and processes data on all suspected and confirmed cases of VL. The study found that the variables significantly associated with death from VL were weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, and age ≥60 years. A prognostic score was developed using these variables, which had a predictive performance of 71.4% sensitivity, 73.7% specificity, 28.9% positive predictive value, 94.5% negative predictive value, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 75.6%. These findings may help improve clinical management of patients and contribute to lower mortality from VL.
Plants rely heavily on receptor-like kinases ( RLKs ) for perception and integration of external and internal stimuli . The Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich repeat RLK ( LRR-RLK ) BAK1 is involved in steroid hormone responses , innate immunity , and cell death control . Here , we describe the differential regulation of three different BAK1-dependent signaling pathways by a novel allele of BAK1 , bak1-5 . Innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent RKs FLS2 and EFR is severely compromised in bak1-5 mutant plants . However , bak1-5 mutants are not impaired in BR signaling or cell death control . We also show that , in contrast to the RD kinase BRI1 , the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have very low kinase activity , and we show that neither was able to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro . Furthermore , kinase activity for all partners is completely dispensable for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta , revealing another pathway specific mechanistic difference . The specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 is not due to a differential interaction of BAK1-5 with the respective ligand-binding RK but requires BAK1-5 kinase activity . Overall our results demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth , innate immunity , and cell death by the regulatory RLK BAK1 , which may reveal key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD RKs .
 We have developed a novel experimental/computational approach to study the effects of anticancer treatments on cancer cell populations. Our method combines time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometry data with a computational model of the cell cycle and subsequent generations. The model includes modules describing the functional activity of the main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase. We have applied this method to X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells, spanning a wide range of doses. The final model provides a unique rendering of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, including separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. Our method provides a deeper understanding of the effects of treatment on cancer cell populations and can be applied to other cancer cell lines and treatments.
 Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is an essential electron carrier in the respiratory chain that is involved in the development of mitochondrial diseases. The biosynthesis of CoQ involves the production of polyisoprenyl diphosphate in a reaction that requires the enzymes encoded by PDSS1 and PDSS2. Homozygous mutations in either of these genes lead to severe neuromuscular disease with nephrotic syndrome seen in PDSS2 deficiency. We now show that a presumed autoimmune kidney disease in mice with the missense Pdss2kd/kd genotype can be attributed to a mitochondrial CoQ biosynthetic defect. Levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in kidney homogenates from B6 . Pdss2kd/kd mutants were significantly lower than those in B6 control mice. Disease manifestations originate specifically in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease is seen in Podocin/cre , Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice but not in conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional B6 . Alb/cre , Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice have no overt disease despite demonstration that their livers have undetectable CoQ9 levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and significantly altered intermediary metabolism as evidenced by transcriptional profiling and amino acid quantitation. These data suggest that disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes displaying the greatest sensitivity to Pdss2 impairment.
Phenotypic robustness is the ability of an organism to maintain its normal traits despite environmental or genetic perturbations. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood, but it is known that development plays a key role in it. Here, we report that the determinative developmental cell lineages of two protostomes and one deuterostome are structured in such a way that the resulting cellular compositions of the organisms are only modestly affected by cell deaths. Several features of the cell lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types, underlie the robustness. Simple simulations of cell lineage evolution demonstrate the possibility that the observed robustness arose as an adaptation in the face of random cell deaths in development. These results reveal general organizing principles of determinative developmental cell lineages and a conceptually new mechanism of phenotypic robustness, both of which have important implications for development and evolution.
 In this study, we present EmbryoPhenomics, an open-source high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos. The platform consists of an Open-source Video Microscope (OpenVIM) and a Python package Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV) for high-dimensional measurement of phenomic traits from video data sets. We demonstrate the application of EmbryoPhenomics for quantifying integrated organismal responses to environmental change using experiments assessing chronic, acute, and interactive effects of environmental stressors in two ecologically important species with radically different patterns of development: Radix balthica, a freshwater gastropod mollusc, and Orchestia gammarellus, a marine amphipod crustacean. Our results show the efficacy and transferability of this platform and its potential to revolutionize the study of embryonic development and phenomics.
 Malaria parasites ( Plasmodium spp . ) have different metabolic requirements in their asexual and sexual stages in the mosquito and human hosts. We used stable isotope labelling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to map stage-specific changes in Plasmodium berghei carbon metabolism and determine the functional significance of these changes on parasite survival in the blood and mosquito stages. We found that glutamine serves as the predominant input into TCA metabolism in both asexual and sexual blood stages and is important for complete male gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolism, as well as key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis, are also essential for ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito. These data extend our knowledge of Plasmodium metabolism and point towards possible targets for transmission-blocking intervention strategies. Furthermore, they highlight significant metabolic differences between Plasmodium species which are not easily anticipated based on genomics or transcriptomics studies and underline the importance of integration of metabolomics data with other platforms in order to better inform drug discovery and design.
 We have previously shown that the KSHV major latency transcripts are regulated by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins . Using viral genome-wide chromatin conformation capture ( 3C ) methods , we now show that KSHV latency control region is physically linked to the promoter regulatory region for ORF50 , which encodes the KSHV immediate early protein RTA . Other linkages were also observed , including an interaction between the 5′ and 3′ end of the latency transcription cluster . Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages , and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control . siRNA depletion of CTCF or cohesin subunits also disrupted chromosomal linkages and deregulated viral latent and lytic gene transcription . Furthermore , the linkage between the latency and lytic control region was subject to cell cycle fluctuation and disrupted during lytic cycle reactivation , suggesting that these interactions are dynamic and regulatory . Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions , and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control .
 Scrub typhus is a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia . The causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that is transmitted to humans by the bite of a Leptotrombidium mite . Research into the basic mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity of O . tsutsugamushi has lagged behind that of other important human pathogens . In this study, we have performed a body of work designed to improve methods for quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of this important but neglected human pathogen. These results will be useful to other researchers working on O . tsutsugamushi and also other obligate intracellular pathogens such as those in the Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales families. We present a standardized method for comparing the viability of O . tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment, and propagation under various conditions. Taken together, we present a body of data to support improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of this organism. This data will be useful both for improving clinical isolation rates as well as performing in vitro cell biology experiments.
 The study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of praziquantel ( PZQ ) treatment in children aged 1–5 years old who are naturally exposed to schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe. The study found that PZQ treatment is safe and efficacious in children aged 1–5 years old, with an egg reduction rate of 99% and a cure rate of 92%. These results are comparable to the efficacy of PZQ treatment in children aged 6–10 years old. The study suggests that PZQ treatment can be safely and effectively used to control schistosomiasis in children aged 1–5 years old.
30% of human cancers are caused by mutations in the Ras gene. However, Ras mutations alone are not enough to cause tumors, so it is important to identify other genes and pathways that cooperate with Ras to promote tumorigenesis. We used a near-genome-wide functional screen in Drosophila to identify multiple novel, evolutionarily-conserved pathways that control Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. We found that low expression of the confirmed hits significantly correlated with the KRASG12 mutation status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. Among the novel top 80 candidate cancer genes, we mechanistically characterized the function of the top hit, the Tetraspanin family member Tsp29Fb, revealing that it regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion. Our functional Drosophila screen uncovers multiple novel and evolutionarily conserved epithelial cancer genes, and experimentally confirmed Tsp29Fb as a key regulator of EGFR/Ras induced epithelial tumor growth and invasion.
 Meiotic drive is a phenomenon where certain alleles are transmitted to offspring at a higher rate than others. This can lead to the spread of harmful alleles and genetic conflict between the drive and other parts of the genome. In this study, we investigated the wtf gene family from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which has been shown to contain meiotic drivers. We discovered that wtf13 is a meiotic driver that kills spores that do not inherit it by generating both a diffusible poison and a spore-specific antidote. We also found that wtf18-2 is a suppressor of wtf13 that acts by making only an antidote. This suppressor benefits from the infertility caused by the driver, which is a novel type of drive suppressor. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms and evolution of meiotic drive systems.
 In this study, the authors developed an algorithm to predict gene expression changes in humans based on their genetic variation. The algorithm uses multiple SNPs in the genomic vicinity of the predicted gene and incorporates a comprehensive set of genomic and functional features for each SNP. The authors evaluated the algorithm's performance on four different human populations and found that it can accurately predict gene expression changes with a low false positive rate. The authors suggest that the time may be ripe for a broader examination of this important prediction task, perhaps while incorporating additional features such as trans-acting SNPs.
 Malaria is a complex disease with multiple strains of the same parasite species co-existing within a host. These strains compete with each other for resources and can affect each other's growth and transmission. In this study, we used mathematical models to investigate the cause of competitive suppression of an avirulent strain of Plasmodium chabaudi by a virulent strain in immuno-deficient and immuno-competent mice. We found that the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature red blood cells was the only parameter that needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. Interestingly, this ratio was the same for both clones in single-clone infections but different between the clones in mixed infections. The size of this difference was largest in immuno-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice. This explains why competitive suppression was alleviated in immuno-deficient mice. We found that competitive suppression acts early in infection, even before the day of peak parasitaemia. These results lead us to argue that the innate immune response clearing merozoites is the most likely, but not necessarily the only, mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones. Moreover, in mixed infections we predict there to be an interaction between the clones and the innate immune response which induces changes in the strength of its clearance of merozoites. What this interaction is unknown, but future refinement of the model, challenged with other datasets, may lead to its discovery.
 We present a detailed analysis of 20 human genomes sequenced at high coverage using next-generation sequencing technologies. We summarize the number of genetic variants emerging from this study and provide a proof of concept for the identification of rare and highly-penetrant functional variants by confirming that the cause of hemophilia A is easily recognizable in this data set. We also show that the number of novel single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) discovered per genome seems to stabilize at about 144,000 new variants per genome, after the first 15 individuals have been sequenced. Finally, we find that, on average, each genome carries 165 homozygous protein-truncating or stop loss variants in genes representing a diverse set of pathways. Our work provides important fundamental information about the scope of human genetic variation and suggests ways to further explore the relationship between these genetic variants and human disease.
 Influenza virus infection can alter the start codons of translation initiation in mammalian cells. We used ribosome profiling to systematically map the landscape of translation initiation during influenza virus infection. We found that there is selection against putative CUG alternate translation initiation sites in mammalian influenza virus lineages. We also identified several candidate downstream AUG start sites in influenza mRNAs, one of which encodes a truncated version of the viral neuraminidase protein that is expressed on the cell surface and is enzymatically active. We did not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon influenza infection or during the anti-viral response, but the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites. Our results highlight how alternate translation initiation can alter the protein-coding capacity of both viruses and the cells that they infect.
 The study aimed to identify the role of NleH1 and NleH2 in the pathogenesis of EHEC. The authors found that NleH1 and NleH2 bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 ( RPS3 ), a subunit of NF-κB transcriptional complexes. NleH1 and NleH2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr protein kinases, but their binding to RPS3 is independent of kinase activity. NleH1 repressed the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, but did not inhibit the transcription of RPS3-independent reporters. In contrast, NleH2 stimulated RPS3-dependent transcription, as well as an AP-1-dependent reporter. The authors suggest that NleH may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes.
 Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. The binding specificity of a TF to its target DNA sequence is a fundamental regulatory interaction. The most common model used to represent TF binding specificities is a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), which assumes independence between binding positions. However, in many cases, this simplifying assumption does not hold. Here, we present feature motif models (FMMs), a novel probabilistic method for modeling TF–DNA interactions based on log-linear models. Our approach uses sequence features to represent TF binding specificities, where each feature may span multiple positions. We develop the mathematical formulation of our model and devise an algorithm for learning its structural features from binding site data. We also developed a discriminative motif finder, which discovers de novo FMMs that are enriched in target sets of sequences compared to background sets. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and on the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harbison et al. We then apply our algorithm to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human, reveal sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs, and show that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs. Our FMM learning and motif finder software are available at http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/.
α2C receptors are a type of adrenergic receptor that modulate the sympathetic nervous system. These receptors are important for the fight-or-flight response and have been shown to be under positive selection during chicken domestication. In this study, we found that the neuronal expression of ADRA2C is lower in humans and chimpanzees than in other primates. We also identified a cis-regulatory region in the ADRA2C gene that has been significantly accelerated in humans and chimpanzees. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor ( NRSF ) binding motifs, each of which harbors a polymorphism. Our genotyping and analysis of population genome data indicate that at both polymorphic sites, the derived allele has reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees but not in other primates. Our CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays show that both derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C. In addition, we detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. Our findings suggest that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.
 We developed a new informatics framework to enable deep evolutionary comparison of gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. We exploited this to compare gene expression in species representing two independent C4 lineages ( Cleome gynandra and Zea mays ) whose last common ancestor diverged ∼140 million years ago. We define a cohort of 3 , 335 genes that represent conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. Furthermore, we show that genes encoding proteins of the C4 cycle are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes. Despite the wide evolutionary separation and independent origins of the C4 phenotype, we report that these species use homologous transcription factors to both induce C4 photosynthesis and to maintain the cell specific gene expression required for the pathway to operate. We define a core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation that is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of the monocotyledons and dicotyledons. We show that deep evolutionary comparisons of gene expression can reveal novel insight into the molecular convergence of highly complex phenotypes and that parallel evolution of transcription factors underpins the repeated appearance of C4 photosynthesis. Thus, exploitation of extant natural variation associated with complex traits can be used to identify regulators. Moreover, the transcription factors that are shared by independent C4 lineages are key targets for engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice.
 Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a rare but severe illness caused by infection with one of five strains of the Ebola virus. The largest outbreak of EVD occurred in West Africa from 2013 to 2016, with over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or humans, or with contaminated objects. The virus can also be transmitted through the air, although this is not thought to be a major route of transmission.  In this study, researchers investigated the persistence of Ebola virus RNA in the respiratory tract of a healthcare worker who was infected with Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone. The patient was hospitalized at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Lazzaro Spallanzani" in Rome, Italy, where they received treatment and recovered from the infection.  The researchers found that the patient had high levels of Ebola virus RNA in their respiratory tract, even after the virus had been cleared from their blood. This suggests that the virus may be able to replicate in the respiratory tract, which could increase the risk of transmission to others.  The study highlights the importance of understanding the persistence and replication of Ebola virus RNA in different body compartments, as this could help inform the development of new countermeasures and improve our understanding of the pathways of human-to-human transmission.
 The study aimed to investigate the role of different domains of the glycoprotein complex (GPC) of the Junin virus (JUNV) in attenuating the virus. The authors rescued several recombinant viruses expressing the ectodomain of GPC from JUNV either alone (MCg1), along with the transmembrane domain (TMD) F438I substitution (MCg2), or with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg3). All viruses exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells. In mice, MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality as compared with rMACV. MCg1 was detected in brains and spleens of MCg1-infected mice and the infection was associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, all animals survived MCg2 and MCg3 infection without detectable levels of virus in various organs while producing neutralizing antibody against Cd#1. The authors suggest the indispensable role of each GPC domain in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC.
 The centromeric histone 3 variant ( CENH3 ) is essential for the segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis . To better define CENH3 functional constraints , we complemented a null allele in Arabidopsis with a variety of mutant alleles , each inducing a single amino acid change in conserved residues of the histone fold domain . Many of these transgenic missense lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-pollination , but exhibited frequent post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants . The failure of centromeres marked by these missense mutation in the histone fold domain of CENH3 reproduces the genome elimination syndromes described with chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species . Additionally , evidence that a single point mutation is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer provide a simple one-step method for the identification of non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species . As proof of the extreme simplicity of this approach to create haploid-inducing lines , we performed an in silico search for previously identified point mutations in CENH3 and identified an Arabidopsis line carrying the A86V substitution within the histone fold domain . This A87V non-transgenic line , while fully fertile on self-pollination , produced postzygotic death and uniparental haploids when crossed to wild type . , Introduction:  Accurate segregation of eukaryotic chromosomes into daughter cells requires the presence of a centromere . Centromeres are , in most species , a region on each chromosome that directs the assembly of the kinetochore during mitosis and meiosis . The kinetochore is a substantial molecular motor , consisting of hundreds of proteins , which regulates and drives the migration of sister chromatids ( in mitosis ) or homologous chromosomes ( in meiosis I ) to opposite poles of the cell [1–4] . Centromeres are largely thought to be determined epigenetically by the presence of nucleosomes containing the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENH3 ( aka , CENP-A ) [5–9] . In stark contrast to conventional histones , which are among the most conserved proteins in eukaryotes , CENH3 is rapidly evolving [10] . CENH3 structure is divided into two domains , a highly variable ( in length and sequence ) N-terminal tail and the more conserved C-terminal Histone Fold Domain ( HFD ) . Although a handful of amino acids are highly conserved at the N-terminus of the N-terminal tail domain , the rest of the tail is so rapidly evolving that it cannot be aligned even among fairly related clades . For example , among the eudicots known CENH3 N-terminal tails range in length from 23 to 194 amino acids [11] . The HFD is in contrast , relatively well conserved , although it displays signatures of adaptive evolution in some residues [10 , 12] . Given the proven role of CENH3 in the specification of the centromere , it is of no surprise that null alleles , though transmissible , are lethal as homozygotes [13–16] . Similarly , defects in the localization of CENH3- either a failure to reload or promiscuous loading to more than one site per chromosome- would be expected to lead to chromosomes instability in several organisms , including budding yeast , humans and Arabidopsis [17–19] . Manipulation of CENH3 itself also has dramatic effects on chromosome segregation , an outcome with both basic and applied significance [11 , 20–22] . Swapping the CENH3 hypervariable N-terminal tail with that of histone H3 . 3-like and concurrent fusion to GFP ( “GFP-tailswap” ) produces in a partially sterile plants showing meiotic defects . Interestingly , when the GFP-tailswap line is crossed to the wild type , the chromosomes derived from the parent expressing this chimeric protein missegregate during embryogenesis , resulting in elimination of the corresponding parental genome , producing haploid plants whose chromosomes were derived from only the wild-type CENH3 parent . Ma
 The differentiation of embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) in vitro is a powerful system for identifying developmental cues required for lineage commitment . In this study, the authors modified the H9 hESC line to allow selection of pluripotent hESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns. Splice events for these groups corresponded to the pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control as well as genes with serine/threonine kinase and helicase activity. Using a new program named AltAnalyze, the authors identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and that promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. By combining genome-wide predictions of alternative splicing with new functional annotations, the authors suggest potential mechanisms that may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation.
 Trehalose is a disaccharide that is essential for the viability of many pathogenic organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The OtsA-OtsB2 pathway is the dominant route for trehalose biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis. The OtsB2 enzyme is strictly essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo. We generated a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis that allows the regulated silencing of the otsB2 gene. We found that otsB2 is essential for growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro as well as for the acute infection phase in mice following aerosol infection. By contrast, otsB2 is not essential for the chronic infection phase in mice. Blocking OtsB2 resulted in the accumulation of its substrate T6P, which appears to be toxic, leading to the self-poisoning of cells. Accordingly, blocking T6P production in a ΔotsA mutant abrogated otsB2 essentiality. T6P accumulation elicited a global upregulation of more than 800 genes, which might result from an increase in RNA stability implied by the enhanced neutralization of toxins exhibiting ribonuclease activity. Surprisingly, overlap with the stress response caused by the accumulation of another toxic sugar phosphate molecule, maltose-1-phosphate, was minimal. A genome-wide screen for synthetic lethal interactions with otsA identified numerous genes, revealing additional potential drug targets synergistic with OtsB2 suitable for combination therapies that would minimize the emergence of resistance to OtsB2 inhibitors.
 The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T . cruzi ) causes Chagas' disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11–18 million people. Recent studies have revealed an essential T . cruzi proline racemase enzyme ( TcPR ) as an attractive candidate for improved chemotherapeutic intervention. Conformational changes associated with substrate binding to TcPR are believed to expose critical residues that elicit a host mitogenic B-cell response, a process contributing to parasite persistence and immune system evasion. Characterization of the conformational states of TcPR requires access to long-time-scale motions that are currently inaccessible by standard molecular dynamics simulations. Here we describe advanced accelerated molecular dynamics that extend the effective simulation time and capture large-scale motions of functional relevance. Conservation and fragment mapping analyses identified potential conformational epitopes located in the vicinity of newly identified transient binding pockets. The newly identified open TcPR conformations revealed by this study along with knowledge of the closed to open interconversion mechanism advances our understanding of TcPR function. The results and the strategy adopted in this work constitute an important step toward the rationalization of the molecular basis behind the mitogenic B-cell response of TcPR and provide new insights for future structure-based drug discovery.
 The iKO system is a new method for inducible and reversible gene knockout in mice. It involves two genetically modified mouse lines: a KO line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated (TIGRE) genomic locus. The KO and TIGRE lines have been engineered for high-throughput, large-scale, and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As a proof of concept, the iKO system was used to create mice with inducible and reversible knockout of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene. The results demonstrated reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system is a versatile genetic system that can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications.
 Our study is the first one to describe in a murine model the genetic response of placental environment to T . cruzi infection and suggests the development of a strong immune response , parasite genotype-dependent , to the detriment of cellular metabolism , which may contribute to control infection preventing the risk of congenital transmission .
 Sindbis virus ( SINV ) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes arthritis and rash in humans. It is known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. SINV occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical countries, and in northern Europe it is suggested to cause regularly reoccurring outbreaks. In this study, we evaluated mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden. We found that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes constitutes the most valuable outbreak marker for further scrutinising the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks and the mechanisms behind. Our findings suggest that SINV-I is endemic in the River Dalälven floodplains and that it is maintained in the enzootic vector Culex torrentium/pipiens and the bridge-vector Aedes cinereus. We also found that SINV-I is genetically diverse and that it is introduced and evolved in the vector mosquitoes over the years. Our study provides valuable information for understanding the ecology and evolution of SINV-I in northern Europe and for developing effective strategies for controlling its transmission.
 The olfactory system is a complex network of neurons that is responsible for detecting and interpreting odors. In this study, we used a computational model to investigate how multiple coding mechanisms interact and integrate in the olfactory system. We found that plasticity at the synapses between the antenna lobe and the mushroom body can efficiently regulate the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense antenna lobe output and condense it to a sparse representation in the mushroom body. This plasticity drives the observed specificity, reliability, and expected persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing and making a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses. Our findings provide new insights into how the olfactory system encodes and processes information.
 The human genome has been sequenced, and now we can use this information to study complex diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD) from a functional genomic perspective. By revealing comprehensive repertoires of molecular activities, these technologies combined with systems biology analyses will help us to better understand the complexity underlying common disorders. The aim of the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study was to identify functionally associated genes important for CAD using whole-genome expression profiles from multiple organs. To do this, we used a modified version of a two-way clustering approach. In the first step, the algorithm processed all mRNA signals within one organ to define a number of tissue clusters. The individual genes of the tissue clusters are defined by the level of associations between mRNA signals across all patients. In the second step, the patients were clustered according to the mRNA signals within each tissue cluster to identify signals related to clinical phenotypes. In this study, the clinical endpoint was the extent of coronary atherosclerotic lesions as judged from the degree of coronary stenosis, measured by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). A secondary hypothesis was to reveal the extent to which any tissue cluster related to coronary stenosis acts in isolation in one organ or across several organs. A multi-organ biopsy approach is primarily motivated by the nature of CAD development: atherosclerotic diseases are believed to start in adolescence and develop throughout life. The pace of development depends on genetic and environmental risk factors. Of particular importance are metabolic disturbances (e.g., overweight, diabetes, and dyslipidemias) that originate in organs central to energy metabolism, including liver, skeletal muscle, and fat deposits. Thus, molecular activities (mirrored by mRNA levels) distant from the actual site of CAD are likely to influence the progression and extent of coronary atherosclerosis. The STAGE study comprises 114 carefully characterized patients, including a compendium of 278 global gene-expression profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues isolated during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Using a two-way clustering approach, we analyzed this compendium to test our main hypothesis that there are groups of functionally associated genes (rather than individual genes) of importance for CAD and to determine whether those groups of genes act in isolation in each tissue or across several tissues.
24-hour circadian rhythms are observed in many organisms, including cyanobacteria. The circadian clock in cyanobacteria is composed of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which form a post-translational oscillator. The KaiC protein has four phosphorylation sites, T432, S431, T430, and S429. The phosphorylation state of KaiC changes during the day, and it is thought that the phosphorylation state of KaiC regulates the expression of kaiBC. However, the exact mechanism of how the phosphorylation state of KaiC regulates kaiBC expression is not yet clear. In this study, we developed a mathematical model that simulates the circadian clock in cyanobacteria. We found that the phosphorylation state of KaiC regulates kaiBC expression in a complex way. Specifically, we found that the phosphorylation state of KaiC affects the expression of kaiBC in two ways. First, the phosphorylation state of KaiC affects the expression of kaiBC directly. Second, the phosphorylation state of KaiC affects the expression of kaiBC indirectly by affecting the expression of other proteins that regulate kaiBC expression. Our model provides a new understanding of how the phosphorylation state of KaiC regulates kaiBC expression in cyanobacteria.
 HIV-2 is a less pathogenic virus than HIV-1, with slower disease progression and lower viral loads. We investigated whether HIV-2 reservoirs follow the same distribution as HIV-1 reservoirs, with limited infection of central-memory CD4 T lymphocytes ( TCM ). We analyzed HIV-2 DNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and CD8-depleted PBMCs from 12 non-progressors and 2 progressors of HIV-2 infection. We found that HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes and was quantifiable in transitional-memory CD4 T cells ( TTM ) but not in TCM. HIV-2 DNA levels in PBMCs correlated with those in TTM, but not TCM. HIV-2 reactivation was observed in cells from only 3 individuals. We also analyzed cell surface markers, co-receptors, and restriction factors in CD4 T cells from individuals and donors. We found that TCM had a lower expression of CXCR6 transcripts and a higher expression of TRIM5 transcripts than TTM. These findings suggest that the low HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and a limited infection of TCM associated with a lower expression of a potential alternative HIV-2 co-receptor, CXCR6, and a higher expression of a restriction factor, TRIM5. These findings shed new light on the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection, suggesting mechanisms close to those reported in other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection models.
 Attention is a fundamental cognitive process that allows us to focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant information. The Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) is a new model that describes how attention is processed in the brain. The model is based on mathematical equations and is implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons. The model is able to reproduce several observed forms of attentional modulation, including shifting and shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features, and response gain effects in neuronal contrast-response functions. The model provides a unified explanation for these forms of attentional modulation and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions. The ARC is fully implemented in spiking neurons and specifies how top-down feedback signals can be used to perform selective routing of attended visual stimuli in the brain. The model defines this process at multiple levels of abstraction, from a large scale network comprising multiple hierarchical cortical areas, to the laminar microcircuitry of cortical columns, and to the attentional modulation of single cells. The ARC provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in the brain and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions that can be tested experimentally.
 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and heritable arrhythmia that can lead to serious health problems. Many genes have been linked to AF, but their role in the disease is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data from a large community-based sample of individuals with and without AF. We did not find any significant associations between common coding genetic variants and AF. However, we did find a common missense variant in SYNPO2L that may be associated with AF. We also did not find any significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated AF genes. Our findings suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. Further evaluation of the SYNPO2L variant is needed to determine its causal relationship to AF. Efforts to identify biologically meaningful coding variation underlying AF may require large sample sizes or populations enriched for large genetic effects.
 Alveolar echinococcosis ( AE ) is a rare but dangerous disease caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus multilocularis parasite. It is an emerging disease in Poland, with a significant increase in the number of cases in recent years. The aim of this study was to collect and analyze data on human AE in Poland over the past two decades. The sources of data were both officially registered cases and those detected through active field and laboratory surveillance. The cases were verified by clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria. During the two decades, a continuous increase in detection rate was noticed. The cases were 6–82 years old at the time of diagnosis, with a mean age of 47.7 years. The AE was fatal in 19% of patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years. Family agglomeration of AE was found in 4 foci, involving 9 patients. Seventy-six of the patients were diagnosed in an advanced stage of disease. In all cases, the liver was the primary location of AE. In 30% of patients, a spread to other organs was observed. Ninety-four of the patients were treated with albendazole. In 73% of patients, a surgical operation was performed, including 15 liver transplantations. The studies confirmed that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, which is the fourth country in Europe with over 120 cases detected. The results also indicate the need for a wider national programme for implementation of screening in the highest AE risk areas, with an effort to increase the public awareness of the possibility of contracting E . multilocularis , and above all, training of the primary care physicians in the recognition of the risk of AE to allow for an early detection of this dangerous disease.
 Zinc is an essential trace element for all living organisms, and its homeostasis is tightly regulated by a variety of proteins, including the zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein. In this study, the authors solved the structure of Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and found that Zur represses gene expression by a highly cooperative binding of two adjacent dimers to essentially encircle the core element of each of the Zur-regulated promoters. They also discovered a new member of the Zur-regulon: pliG. The authors demonstrate that Zur directly regulates pliG in a zinc responsive manner and that the degree of Zur repression observed in vivo by comparison of transcript copy number in wild-type and Δzur strains parallels this trend spanning a 100-fold difference. The authors conclude that the number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) -family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly and that the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters.
 Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants . In 2008–2009 , a RVF outbreak affected the whole Madagascar island , including the Anjozorobe district located in Madagascar highlands . An entomological survey showed the absence of Aedes among the potential RVF virus ( RVFV ) vector species identified in this area , and an overall low abundance of mosquitoes due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter . No serological nor virological sign of infection was observed in wild terrestrial mammals of the area , suggesting an absence of wild RVFV reservoir . However , a three years serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed a recurrent RVFV circulation . The objective of this study was to understand the key determinants of this unexpected recurrent transmission . To achieve this goal , a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions using observational data collected in the area . Three scenarios that could explain the RVFV circulation in the area were analyzed: ( i ) RVFV overwintering thanks to a direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve , vectors being absent during winter , ( ii ) a low level vector-based circulation during winter thanks to a residual vector population , without direct transmission between cattle , ( iii ) combination of both above mentioned mechanisms . Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve . Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field observations , 84% of cattle infections being attributed to vector-borne transmission , and 16% to direct transmission . These results appeared robust according to the sensitivity analysis . Interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields , seasonality of vector proliferation , and cattle exchange practices could be a key element for understanding RVFV circulation in this area of Madagascar highlands .
 The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive mosquito species that has spread globally and is a major public health threat. We used 13 nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial COI sequences to investigate the historical and contemporary movements of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region and characterize its population structure. We found that Ae. albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Southeast Asia before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or SE Asia. The recent incursion into northern Australia’s Torres Strait Islands was seeded chiefly from Indonesia. We provide evidence of a recently colonized population that has undergone rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be the result of genetic drift or represent a secondary invasion from an unknown source. There appears to be high spatial genetic structure and high gene flow between some geographically distant populations. The species' genetic structure in the region tends to favour a dispersal pattern driven mostly by human movements. Our study provides a more widespread sampling distribution of the species’ native range, revealing more spatial population structure than previously shown. Additionally, we present the most probable invasion history of this species in the Australasian region using ABC analysis.
 Schistosomiasis is a serious neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Tanzania, the United Republic of Tanzania has the second highest number of cases in the region. In this study, we investigated the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on a panel of morbidity indicators, including physical fitness and quality of life, among schoolchildren in Mwanza Region, Tanzania. We found that S. mansoni infection had a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not on physical fitness. Our findings suggest that more in-depth studies are needed to refine the tool so it focuses more on aspects of quality of life that may be affected by schistosome infections.
 Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete Leptospira. The main reservoirs of Leptospira are wild rodents, including the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Experimental studies of Leptospira infection in rats have previously used an intraperitoneal inoculation route. However, knowledge of rat-rat transmission requires the use of a natural route of inoculation, such as a mucosal or subcutaneous route. We investigated the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation routes compared to the reference intraperitoneal route during Leptospira infection in adult rats. Infection characteristics were studied using Leptospira renal isolation, serology, and molecular and histological analyses. Leptospira infection was asymptomatic using each inoculation route, and caused similar antibody production regardless of renal colonization. The observed renal colonization rates were 8 out of 8 rats, 5 out of 8 rats, and 1 out of 8 rats for the intraperitoneal, mucosal, and subcutaneous inoculation routes, respectively. Thus, among the natural infection routes studied, mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. These results can facilitate understanding of the infection modalities in rats and increase our knowledge of rat-rat disease transmission. Future studies of other natural inoculation routes in rat models will allow the investigation of infection kinetics.
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes damage to its own tissues and organs. The current treatment for sepsis is largely supportive, and there is a need for better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of sepsis to develop effective treatments. In this study, the authors identified a novel role for Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in inhibiting pro-inflammatory response by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-17 signaling during sepsis. They found that anxa2-/- mice exhibited increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, but decreased bacterial clearance and animal survival. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas9 KO strategy down-regulated inflammation and conferred protection against sepsis in anxa2-/- mice. The authors suggest that AnxA2 plays a critical role in inhibiting heightened inflammatory response by regulation of ROS and IL-17A in this experimental sepsis.
 HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a key role in viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Poly ( I∶C ) and LPS, the ligands for TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, are known to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), but the mechanism is incompletely understood. We found that poly ( I∶C ) and LPS, but not TLR7 or TLR9 agonists, suppress infection by CCR5-using, macrophage-tropic HIV-1, and by VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Integrated pro-viruses were readily detected in unstimulated, TLR7- and TLR9-stimulated cells, but not in TLR3- or TLR4-stimulated MDMs, suggesting alteration of post-entry, pre-integration events. Using microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we found increased miR-155 levels in MDMs upon TLR3/4- but not TLR7-stimulation, and a miR-155 specific inhibitor (but not a scrambled control) partially restored infectivity in poly ( I∶C )-stimulated MDMs. Ectopic miR-155 expression remarkably diminished HIV-1 infection in primary MDMs and cell lines. Furthermore, poly ( I∶C )-stimulation and ectopic miR-155 expression did not alter detection of early viral RT products, but both resulted in an accumulation of late RT products and in undetectable or extremely low levels of integrated pro-viruses and 2-LTR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels of several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in trafficking and/or nuclear import of pre-integration complexes (ADAM10, TNPO3, Nup153, LEDGF/p75) were found in poly ( I∶C )-stimulated and miR-155-transfected MDMs, and a reporter assay suggested they are authentic miR-155 targets. Our findings provide evidence that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.
 Our study reveals that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day. We show that a group of plant hormone-associated genes are coexpressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal. This expression correlates with overrepresentation of a cis-acting element ( CACATG ) in phytohormone gene promoters, which is sufficient to confer the predicted diurnal and circadian expression patterns in vivo. Using circadian clock and light signaling mutants, we show that both internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth. From these data, we argue that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day. This temporal integration of hormone pathways allows plants to fine tune phytohormone responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth regulation.
 Insects are a major source of food for many people around the world, but they also carry diseases that can be transmitted to humans. One such disease is Chagas, which is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted by the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus. Researchers have found that feeding R. prolixus bacteria that produce dsRNA specific for genes involved in egg production and development can reduce the number of eggs laid and the number of offspring produced. This could be a new way to control the spread of Chagas disease.
Fever in pregnancy is dangerous for both mother and foetus . In the 1980s, malaria was the leading cause of death in pregnant women in refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border . Artemisinin combination therapy has significantly reduced the incidence of malaria in the population . However, the remaining causes of fever in pregnancy are not well documented. Pregnant women attending antenatal care were invited to have a comprehensive clinical and laboratory screen if they had fever. Women were admitted to hospital, treated, and followed up weekly until delivery. A convalescent serum was collected on day 21. Delivery outcomes were recorded. Febrile episodes occurred in 5.0% (409/8117) of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics from 7-Jan-2004 to 17-May-2006. The main cause was malaria in 55.5% (227/409). A cohort of 203 (49.6% of 409) women had detailed fever investigations and follow-up. Arthropod-borne (malaria, rickettsial infections, and dengue) and zoonotic disease (leptospirosis) accounted for nearly half of all febrile illnesses, 47.3% (96/203). Coinfection was observed in 3.9% (8/203) of women, mostly malaria and rickettsia. Pyelonephritis, 19.7% (40/203), was also a common cause of fever. Once malaria, pyelonephritis, and acute respiratory illness are excluded by microscopy and/or clinical findings, one-third of the remaining febrile infections will be caused by rickettsia or leptospirosis. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth and low birth weight. One woman died (no positive laboratory tests). Malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy on the Thai-Burmese border. Scrub and murine typhus were also important causes of fever associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Febrile pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border who do not have malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infection should be treated with azithromycin, effective for typhus and leptospirosis.
 In humans , chromosome-number abnormalities have been associated with altered recombination and increased maternal age . Therefore , age-related effects on recombination are of major importance , especially in relation to the mechanisms involved in human trisomies . Here , we examine the relationship between maternal age and recombination rate in humans . We localized crossovers at high resolution by using over 600 , 000 markers genotyped in a panel of 69 French-Canadian pedigrees , revealing recombination events in 195 maternal meioses . Overall , we observed the general patterns of variation in fine-scale recombination rates previously reported in humans . However , we make the first observation of a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age in humans , likely driven by chromosome-specific effects . The effect appears to be localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions . We postulate that , for some chromosomes , protection against non-disjunction provided by recombination becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age , which can be partly responsible for the higher rates of aneuploidy in older women . We propose a model that reconciles our findings with reported associations between maternal age and recombination in cases of trisomies .
 In this study, we investigated the mechanism behind the protective immunity induced by our fungal vaccine model in immunocompromised mice. We found that the protective immunity was mediated by enhanced cytokine recall responses in macrophages, which were maintained for at least 70 days post-immunization. The enhanced cytokine recall responses were pathogen-specific and dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation. We also observed increased binding of STAT1 to promoter regions of genes associated with protective anti-fungal immunity in immunized, unchallenged macrophages. Our findings suggest that IFN-γ priming of macrophages in vivo results in the establishment of antigen-specific innate memory-like responses, which provide complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of vaccine strategies designed to enhance innate immune responses against specific pathogens to provide protection against diseases that target immunocompromised individuals.
 Polycomb repressive complexes ( PRCs ) are important epigenetic regulators of development in plants and animals. In plants, PRCs are involved in the regulation of flowering and embryonic development. However, the specific functions of different PRC components are not well understood. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing technology to compare changes in H3K27me3 levels and gene expression profiles in Arabidopsis mutants lacking different PRC components. We found that different combinations of PRC components have distinct functions in the regulation of flowering and embryonic development. Our results suggest that specific transcription factors interact with different PRC components to regulate developmental programs. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of PRC-mediated developmental regulation in plants.
 RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) is a key enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA in eukaryotic cells. The trigger loop ( TL ) is a conserved domain within the Pol II active site that plays a critical role in transcription. To better understand the function of the TL, we performed a large-scale analysis of nearly all TL single variants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Sce ) Pol II. We found that TL mutants can be grouped into three classes based on their phenotypes, which are associated with different stress response profiles. Our analysis revealed that TL mutants can have distinct effects on transcription elongation rates and specific transcription defects in vivo. We also identified examples of inter-residue epistasis, which are likely drivers of incompatibility of RNAP evolutionary variants when placed in the Pol II context. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the fitness and phenotypic landscape of the Sce Pol II TL and identifies functional contributions of each TL residue.
Rabies is a fatal disease of the nervous system caused by rabies virus (RV). The majority of rabies infections are caused by bites or scratches from rabid carnivores or bats. RV usually utilizes the retrograde transport within the neuronal network to spread from the infection site to the central nervous system (CNS) where it replicates in neuronal somata and infects other neurons via trans-synaptic spread. However, it is unknown whether hematogenous spread from the site of infection directly to the brain after accidental spill over into the vascular system might represent an alternative way for RV to invade the CNS. To determine whether certain RV variants might have the capacity to invade the CNS from the periphery via hematogenous spread, we infected mice either intramuscularly (i. m.) or intravenously (i. v.) with the dog-associated RV DOG4 or the silver-haired bat-associated RV SB. In addition to monitoring the progression of clinical signs of rabies, we used immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to follow the spread of the virus from the infection site to the brain. In contrast to i. m. infection where both variants caused a lethal encephalopathy, only i. v. infection with SB resulted in the development of a lethal infection. While qRT-PCR did not reveal major differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain at different times after i. m. or i. v. infection of SB, immunohistochemical analysis showed that only i. v. administered SB directly infected the forebrain. The earliest affected regions were those hypothalamic nuclei, which are connected by neurosecretory fibers to the circumventricular organs neurohypophysis and median eminence. Our data suggest that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for the post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat-associated RV.
 Influenza A viruses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused several severe epidemics in the past, including the 1918 pandemic and the 1947 and 1951 epidemics. The evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype is not well understood, particularly the role of reassortment in its evolution. Using a dataset of 71 complete genome sequences of H1N1 viruses sampled between 1918 and 2006, we show that segmental reassortment has played an important role in the evolution of H1N1 viruses since 1918. Specifically, we demonstrate that an H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may also have been associated with reassortant H1N1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassortment therefore appears to be a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized.
 Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) in the brain, leading to an increase in dopamine ( DA ) output. However, the precise mechanisms by which nicotine controls DA signaling are still debated. In this study, the authors used a computational model of the VTA circuitry and nAChR function to investigate the mechanisms by which nicotine controls DA signaling. The model illustrates that both direct stimulation of DA cells and disinhibition of GABA cells can mediate the acute effects of nicotine. The authors propose key experiments to disentangle the contribution of both mechanisms and show that the rate of endogenous acetylcholine input crucially determines the evoked DA response for both mechanisms. Together, the results suggest an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement.
 Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a chronic, disfiguring skin disease caused by Leishmania (L.) tropica infection. In Afghanistan, CL is a major public health problem, with an estimated annual incidence of over 200,000 cases. The current treatment options for CL are limited and often ineffective, leading to high rates of relapse and disfigurement. In this study, we evaluated a novel therapeutic concept to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve the cosmetic outcome of CL. From 2004 to 2008, we performed a two-armed, randomized, double-blinded, phase IIa trial in Kabul, Afghanistan, with patients suffering from L. tropica CL. The skin lesions were treated with bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by daily moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel with (group I) or without (group II) pharmaceutical sodium chlorite (DAC N-055). Patients below age 5, with facial lesions, pregnancy, or serious comorbidities were excluded. The primary outcome was the time needed for complete lesion epithelialization. Biopsies for parasitological and (immuno)histopathological analyses were taken prior to EC (1st), after wound closure (2nd), and after 6 months (3rd). The mean duration for complete wound closure was short and indifferent in group I (59 patients, 43.1 d) and group II (54 patients, 42 d; p=0.83). In patients with Leishmania-positive 2nd biopsies, DAC N-055 caused a more rapid wound epithelialization (37.2 d vs. 58.3 d; p=0.08). Superinfections occurred in both groups at the same rate (8.8%). Except for one patient, reulcerations (10.2% in group I, 18.5% in group II; p=0.158) were confined to cases with persistent high parasite loads after healing. In vitro, DAC N-055 showed a leishmanicidal effect on promastigotes and amastigotes. Compared to previous results with intralesional antimony injections, the EC plus MWT protocol led to more rapid wound closure. The tentatively lower rate of relapses and the acceleration of wound closure in a subgroup of patients with parasite persistence warrant future studies on the activity of DAC N-055. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00947362, Introduction:  Human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a chronic infection caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania that are transmitted by sand fly vectors. In countries of the Near and Middle East such as Afghanistan, L. major and L. tropica are the principal parasite species that account for the development of the typical plaque-like or ulcerative skin lesions. The dermal lesions persist for months or even years, but eventually heal on their own (reviewed in [1]-[4]). However, the healing process can be complicated by superinfections, satellite lesions, or a sporotrichoïd course of infection [1,5-7] and commonly leads to disfiguring and socially stigmatizing scars [8]. Afghanistan is the country with the highest prevalence of CL with an estimated annual incidence of more than 200,000 [11]. During a prevalence survey in Kabul, 2.7% of the population were found to have active disease in 2001 [12] which equals roughly 70,000 inhabitants and made Kabul the world capital of CL. The high prevalence of Phlebotomus sergenti and of L. tropica infections amongst humans accounts for the anthroponotic transmission mode of the disease in Kabul [12-14]. There is currently no standardized procedure for the management of CL following L. tropica or L. major infection. Whereas in the case of small or non-disfiguring lesions or in CL elicited by L. major a “wait and see” strategy can be practiced, ulcerative CL lesions leading to cosmetically relevant chronic wounds as well as lesions due to L. tropica infection usually require therapy. Local treatments recommended by WHO for the management of L. tropica infections include the intrales
 We conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify factors that regulate RAS-mediated MAPK activation. We found 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known factors associated with this pathway. Epistasis experiments revealed that most hits unexpectedly work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors and suggest that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. We further characterized two representative members of this group and found that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. Our study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila. In addition, it suggests that core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing. Finally, it indicates that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events such as those controlling RAF activation but is also tightly governed by the regulation of MAPK expression.
 Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection that affects both humans and animals. The two main species of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C . gattii species complex are C . neoformans and C . gattii. C . neoformans is divided into two varieties, grubii and neoformans, and three serotypes, A, D, and AD. C . gattii is divided into two serotypes, B and C. The current study analyzed 498 isolates of the C . neoformans/C . gattii species complex from Thailand. The majority of the isolates were C . neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their sources. The current study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. The study also identified a greater number of C . gattii isolates in Thailand, including the less virulent minor Vancouver Island outbreak genotype. The current study provides valuable information for understanding the molecular epidemiology of cryptococcosis in Thailand.
1-to-1 orthologous C2H2-ZF TFs in Drosophila species exhibit significant variation in their DNA-binding specificities. These changes are not random but rather occur in a stepwise manner, resulting in increasingly diverse predicted DNA-recognition motifs as evolutionary distance from D . melanogaster increases. Our findings challenge the assumption that 1-to-1 orthologous TFs are always highly conserved and provide evidence that binding specificity modifications in single-copy TFs may play an important role in the regulatory evolution of Drosophila and other higher metazoans.
 Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, respectively. These diseases are a major health problem in developing countries, particularly in South East Asia and Africa. Accurate diagnosis is essential for appropriate antimicrobial therapy and for the implementation of public health policies. Culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is expensive and time-consuming. Serological tests are commonly used in endemic regions, but they have low sensitivity and specificity. Molecular PCR-based methods have been developed to overcome these problems, but they require specialized equipment and expertise. We have developed a new family of repeated DNA sequences, CRISPR, as a serotype-specific target for the development of PCR assays. We have successfully developed conventional and real-time PCR assays for the rapid identification of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates. These assays have high sensitivity and specificity and can be easily performed in any laboratory with access to PCR technology.
 The authors of this study investigated the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of Th1 cells during infection with Leishmania major . They found that Notch signaling through either Notch1 or Notch2 is required for the differentiation of IFNγ-secreting Th1 cells. Furthermore, they showed that this process is independent of the canonical Notch signaling pathway, which involves the transcription factor RBP-Jκ. The authors suggest that Notch signaling may be a potential target for the development of new therapies to treat leishmaniasis.
 HIV-1 is the most common cause of AIDS and affects millions of people worldwide. However, the disproportionate number of HIV-1 cases in sub-Saharan Africa, where parasitic worm infections are common, suggests that these infections may increase the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. In this study, researchers tested whether pre-existing infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni would facilitate systemic infection after mucosal AIDS virus exposure in rhesus monkeys. The results showed that parasitized monkeys were significantly more likely to become infected with the virus at lower doses than normal monkeys. The magnitude of the effect suggests that controlling helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV-1.
 Acetylcholine ( ACh ) is a neurotransmitter that regulates neural excitability and sleep. We used a biophysical model of a cortical network to study how changes in neural excitability and network structure interact to create three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous , traveling asynchronous , and traveling synchronous . Our results match those observed experimentally. During slow wave sleep ( SWS ) there are traveling patterns of activity in the cortex; in other states stationary patterns occur. We show that the level of ACh determines how sensitive network activity is to synaptic heterogeneity. These regimes may have a profound functional significance as stationary patterns may play a role in the proper encoding of external input as memory and traveling waves could lead to synaptic regularization.
 Esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) is a cancer that develops in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity . We found that non-synonymous mutations collectively affect the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) pathway in 25/171 ( 14.6%) of EAC tumors . These mutations were associated with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease . Only rare mutations were identified in adjacent Barrett’s esophagus samples . We validated our findings in an external EAC dataset with non-synonymous TLR pathway mutations in 33/149 (22.1%) of tumors. We also found that TLR4 mutations have decreased responsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients. Our findings show that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in EAC and TLR4 mutations have decreased responsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients.
 The sense of taste is essential for animal survival, helping them to identify food sources and avoid toxic substances. However, the development of taste buds, the sensory end organs for gustation, is not well understood. We used a novel approach to investigate the molecular regulation of taste system development in mice by combining in silico and in vivo analyses. We found that taste receptor calcium signaling molecules (TRCSMs), required for sweet/bitter/umami taste signal transduction, colocalized within developing circumvallate papillae (CVP). Using computational analysis of the upstream regulatory regions of TRCSMs, we identified Hes1 as a likely common regulatory factor. We examined its function in vivo and found that decreased expression of nuclear HES1 correlated with expression of type II taste cell markers. After stage E18, the CVP of Hes1−/− mutants displayed over 5-fold more TRCSM-immunoreactive cells than did the CVP of their wild-type littermates. Thus, according to our composite analyses, Hes1 is likely to play a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds.
 Rice is a monocotyledonous plant that differs from the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis in many aspects. In Arabidopsis, ethylene and auxin act synergistically to regulate root growth and development. However, their interaction in rice is still unclear. Here, we report that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid ( IPA ) -dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using an inhibitor of YUC activity, which regulates auxin biosynthesis via the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid ( IAA ) , we showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. By screening phenotypes of seedling primary root from mutagenesis libraries following ethylene treatment, we identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in YUC8/REIN7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while YUC8/REIN7 overexpression enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. Moreover, YUC8/REIN7 catalyzed the conversion of IPA to IAA, truncated version at C-terminal end of the YUC8/REIN7 resulted in significant reduction of enzymatic activity, indicating that YUC8/REIN7 is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Further investigations indicated that ethylene induced YUC8/REIN7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots. Addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1, strongly demonstrating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed that YUC8/REIN7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functioned downstream of OsEIL1, which directly activated the expression of YUC8/REIN7. Thus, our findings reveal a model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling primary root elongation, enhancing our understanding of ethylene signaling in rice.
 Nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) are a group of bacteria that can cause various diseases in humans, including pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections. The current epidemiological situation of NTM diseases in Saudi Arabia is unclear. To study this trend, a nationwide systematic epidemiological study was conducted for a period of 24 months. A total of 527 isolates were enrolled, with a higher proportion of Saudi citizens, elderly patients, and male gender. The study identified 34 NTM species, including 17 rare species and 8 'undefined' isolates. M . simiae, M . fortuitum, and M . abscessus were the predominant species. The study also noticed 27 new cases of clinically relevant M . riyadhense. Diabetes mellitus and previous history of tuberculosis were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. The results showed that rare clinical events such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis, and ascites caused by M . wolinskyi, M . holsaticum, M . duvalii, and M . monacence, respectively. The study highlights the need for more priorities to be given to NTM's, with an immediate initiative to develop diagnostic infrastructures and disease management plans.
 In this study, the authors used a genetic screen to identify signaling proteins that are necessary for proper quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast. They found that the SNF1/AMPK complex, the cell wall integrity pathway, and a number of cell cycle regulators are required for proper quiescence entry and lifespan extension. The authors also found that the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species are cooperatively controlled by Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1 kinases, and that these three kinases mediate the TOR1-regulated accumulation of storage carbohydrates and lifespan extension. The authors suggest that metabolic reprogramming to increase energy stores and the activation of anti-oxidant defense systems are the primary objectives of the anti-aging signaling network at a time of nutrient scarcity.
 The influenza virus is a common cause of respiratory illness and is known to evolve rapidly to escape the immune response. In this study, the authors used a new method of virus population sequencing to reveal a new role for glycosylation in facilitating immune escape. They found that glycosylation can compensate for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions elsewhere on the virus, thus increasing the viability and subsequent emergence potential of Ab-escape variants. This finding expands our understanding of the viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigenic evolution and highlights the immense power of high-definition virus population sequencing to reveal novel viral adaptive mechanisms.
 Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects the central nervous system. JE is a major public health problem in Asia and the Western Pacific region, and most cases occur in children under the age of 14 years. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 67,900 cases of JE occur worldwide every year, 75% of which affect children under 14 years of age. Many of these patients suffer from severe symptoms, and the case-fatality rate is 20% to 30%. Vaccination remains the most effective protection against JE infection. JE is a mosquito-borne zoonotic infectious disease, and JEV belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. JEV can be transmitted by vector mosquitoes, with Culex tritaeniorhynchus being the primary vector in Taiwan. Outbreaks typically occur during summer in Taiwan, peaking between May and August. Several studies on the seroprevalence of JE were conducted in Taiwan in the 1990s; however, these studies were confined to small local areas, and their definition of seropositivity of antibodies was inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the long-term trend in JE incidence over the past 4 decades by using population surveillance data, and to investigate the prevalence of serum neutralization antibodies based on a nationwide large-scale sample in Taiwan. The average annual JE incidence rate of the group aged 30 years and older was 0.167 cases per 100,000 people between 2001 and 2012, which was higher than the 0.052 cases per 100,000 people among those aged under 30 years. These seroepidemiological findings indicate that the cohort born between 1963 and 1975, who generally received two or three doses of the vaccine and were administered the last booster dose more than 20 years ago, exhibited the lowest positive rate of JE-neutralizing antibodies (54%). The highest and second highest antibody rates were observed, respectively, in the oldest unvaccinated cohort (86%) and in the youngest cohort born between 1981 and 1986, who received four doses 10–15 years ago (74%). Over the past decade, the main age group of the confirmed JE cases in Taiwan shifted from young children to adults over 30 years of age. People who were born between 1963 and 1975 exhibited the lowest seroprevalence of JE-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the key issue for JE control in Taiwan is to reduce adult JE cases through a cost-effective analysis of various immunization strategies.
 Phenome-Wide Association Studies ( PheWAS ) are used to identify associations between genetic polymorphisms and other diagnoses or traits . In this study, we developed new methods to perform PheWAS based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision ( ICD-10 ) codes and biological test results, and to use a quantitative trait as the selection criterion. We tested our approach on thiopurine S-methyltransferase ( TPMT ) activity in patients treated by thiopurine drugs. We developed 2 aggregation methods for the ICD-10 codes: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. Eleven biological test results were also analyzed using discretization algorithms. We applied these methods in patients having a TPMT activity assessment from the clinical data warehouse of a French academic hospital between January 2000 and July 2013. Data after initiation of thiopurine treatment were analyzed and patient groups were compared according to their TPMT activity level. A total of 442 patient records were analyzed representing 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. The results from the ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes and ICD-10 hierarchy codes were concordant. Cross-validation with the biological test results allowed us to validate the ICD phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with a very high TPMT activity ( p=0.0004 and p=0.0015, respectively ). We describe here an original method to perform PheWAS on a quantitative trait using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results to identify associated phenotypes. In the field of pharmacogenomics, PheWAS allow for the identification of new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management.
 Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) is a devastating condition that causes substantial morbidity and mortality and for which no treatments are available . Stem cells offer some promise in the restoration of neurological function . We used systematic review , meta-analysis , and meta-regression to study the impact of stem cell biology and experimental design on motor and sensory outcomes following stem cell treatments in animal models of SCI . One hundred and fifty-six publications using 45 different stem cell preparations met our prespecified inclusion criteria . Only one publication used autologous stem cells . Overall , allogeneic stem cell treatment appears to improve both motor ( effect size , 27 . 2%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] , 25 . 0%–29 . 4%; 312 comparisons in 5 , 628 animals ) and sensory ( effect size , 26 . 3%; 95% CI , 7 . 9%–44 . 7%; 23 comparisons in 473 animals ) outcome . For sensory outcome , most heterogeneity between experiments was accounted for by facets of stem cell biology . Differentiation before implantation and intravenous route of delivery favoured better outcome . Stem cell implantation did not appear to improve sensory outcome in female animals and appeared to be enhanced by isoflurane anaesthesia . Biological plausibility was supported by the presence of a dose–response relationship . For motor outcome , facets of stem cell biology had little detectable effect . Instead most heterogeneity could be explained by the experimental modelling and the outcome measure used . The location of injury , method of injury induction , and presence of immunosuppression all had an impact . Reporting of measures to reduce bias was higher than has been seen in other neuroscience domains but were still suboptimal . Motor outcomes studies that did not report the blinded assessment of outcome gave inflated estimates of efficacy . Extensive recent preclinical literature suggests that stem-cell–based therapies may offer promise , however the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias mean that efficacy is likely to be somewhat lower than reported here .
 Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are a group of parasites that infect over a billion people worldwide, particularly in developing countries. The four most common STHs are Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and two hookworm species. Preventive chemotherapy is the mainstay of STH control, but it does not prevent reinfection. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. We found that reinfection rates were high for all three STHs, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. The prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. There is a need for frequent anthelmintic drug administrations to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation are needed to interrupt transmission of STHs.
 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is a common cause of liver disease in humans and mice. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD, we developed a new method called Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis ( MiNEA ) that compares two conditions using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify deregulated minimal networks ( MiNs ) that can synthesize a target metabolite. We applied MiNEA to identify deregulated metabolic processes in mice and humans that potentially lead to the NAFLD phenotypes. We found that the cholesterol and triacylglycerol synthesis networks were deregulated in humans only, while the ceramide synthesis network was only deregulated in mice. We also found downregulated reactions in the superoxide anion ( SOA ) synthesis network in humans, specifically in NASH as opposed to steatosis, while upregulation was found in the SOA synthesis network in mice. These findings suggest that MiNEA is a versatile tool for exploring and understanding different metabolic phenotypes.
 The olfactory system is responsible for identifying and distinguishing odors. The system is challenged by the enormous variety of odors and the fact that they vary in intensity. To solve this problem, the system may use a coding scheme known as primacy coding, where the identity of an odor is encoded by the receptor types that respond earliest. In this paper, the authors analyze the information transmitted by a simple model of primacy coding using numerical simulations and statistical descriptions. They show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of the odor intensity and the transmitted information is useful to perform typical olfactory tasks with close to experimentally measured performance. The authors also find situations in which a smaller receptor repertoire is advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests that overly sensitive receptor types could dominate the entire response and make the whole array useless, which allows the authors to predict how receptor arrays need to adapt to stay useful during environmental changes. Taken together, the authors show that primacy coding is more useful than simple binary and normalized coding, essentially because the sparsity of the odor representations is independent of the odor statistics. This provides an efficient odor representation that is independent of the odor intensity and might thus help to identify odors in the olfactory cortex.
 HIV bnMAbs are broadly neutralizing antibodies that target multiple regions of the HIV-1 envelope spike. In this study, we found that bnMAbs targeting many neutralizing epitopes of the spike had neutralization profiles for at least one virus that plateaued at <100% . This phenomenon was observed in both a 278-panel of pseudoviruses in a CD4 T-cell (U87 . CCR5 . CXCR4) assay and a panel of 117 viruses in the TZM-bl assay. The bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex of Env and gp41 were most likely to show this behavior. Conversely, bnMAbs targeting the high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to show this behavior. Two CD4 binding site (CD4bs) Abs also showed this behavior relatively infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was also observed in a large peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) -grown molecular virus clone panel derived from patient viral swarms. In addition, five bnMAbs were compared against an 18-virus panel of molecular clones produced in 293T cells and PBMCs and assayed in TZM-bl cells. Examples of plateaus <90% were seen with both types of virus production with no consistent patterns observed. In conclusion, incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves are possible for all HIV bnMAbs against a wide range of viruses produced and assayed in both cell lines and primary cells with implications for the use of antibodies in therapy and as tools for vaccine design.
 In this study, we used a mathematical model to investigate how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine to grow. We found that cancer cells use a combination of aerobic glycolysis and glutamine reductive carboxylation to grow. This combination allows cancer cells to use glucose and glutamine efficiently to produce energy and biomass. We also found that this combination is only effective when the amount of glucose available exceeds the amount that can be fully oxidized by the available oxygen. We validated our findings by analyzing the metabolic behavior of murine K-ras transformed fibroblasts grown in high glucose and low or high glutamine availability. Our study provides new insights into how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine to grow and may help develop new treatments for cancer.
 Prion diseases are a group of rare but fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and animals. The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is the normal form of the prion protein and is found in the plasma membrane of neurons. When PrPC is converted to its disease-associated form (PrPSc), it can cause prion diseases. The molecular environment that hosts the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is not well understood. In this study, the authors used a quantitative investigation of the PrPC interactome in a cell culture model to identify proteins that interact with PrPC. They found that PrPC interacts with several proteins, including the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), the laminin receptor precursor (LRP), and protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). The authors also found that PrPC interacts with two mammalian PrPC paralogs, Doppel (Dpl) and Shadoo (Sho). They used mass spectrometry to quantify the interactions between PrPC and these proteins and found that the interactions were similar in all three proteins. The authors also found that a subset of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones that interact strongly with PrPC escape from the ER to reside in spatial proximity to PrPC at the plasma membrane. The authors suggest that PrPC may organize its molecular environment by its ability to recognize a specialized subset of cell adhesion molecules that recruit membrane proteins carrying high-mannose glycans into spatial proximity with PrPC.
Respiratory virus infections, such as influenza, typically induce a robust type I (pro-inflammatory cytokine) immune response, but the production of type 2 cytokines has been observed. Type 2 cytokines are linked to asthma exacerbation, but they may also be tissue protective. Interleukin (IL)-5 is a prototypical type 2 cytokine that is essential for eosinophil maturation and egress out of the bone marrow. Using a mouse model of influenza virus infection, we found a robust transient release of IL-5 into infected airways along with a significant and progressive accumulation of eosinophils into the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase of infection, i.e., following virus clearance. The cellular source of the IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) infiltrating the infected lungs. Interestingly, the progressive accumulation of eosinophils following virus clearance is reflected in the rapid expansion of c-kit+ IL-5 producing ILC2. We further demonstrated that the enhanced capacity for IL-5 production by ILC2 during recovery is concomitant with the enhanced expression of the IL-33 receptor subunit, ST2, by ILC2. Lastly, we show that NKT cells, as well as alveolar macrophages (AM), are endogenous sources of IL-33 that enhance IL-5 production from ILC2. Collectively, these results reveal that c-kit+ ILC2 interaction with IL-33 producing NKT and AM leads to abundant production of IL-5 by ILC2 and accounts for the accumulation of eosinophils observed during the recovery phase of influenza infection.
 Infections with non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are a common cause of diarrhea in Asia, but the clinical manifestations and epidemiology of NTS disease in Asia are not well documented. We retrospectively identified over 100 cases of NTS infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. We found that HIV infection was a risk factor for death, with the majority of the burden in this population found in HIV-infected adult men. We also found that S. Typhimurium was significantly more common in HIV-infected individuals and that isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Our findings suggest that NTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam with a high mortality rate and that HIV infection is a risk factor for death.
 The authors present a new method for predicting phage structural protein sequences using artificial neural networks ( ANNs ). They first trained ANNs to classify viral structural proteins using amino acid frequency, which correctly classified a large fraction of test cases with high specificity and sensitivity. Subsequently, they added estimates of protein isoelectric points as a feature to ANNs that classify specialized families of proteins, namely major capsid and tail proteins. As expected, these more specialized ANNs were more accurate than the structural ANNs. To experimentally validate the ANN predictions, several ORFs with no significant similarities to known sequences that are ANN-predicted structural proteins were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Some of these self-assembled into structures strongly resembling virion structures. Thus, the authors' ANNs are new tools for identifying phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis. The networks will be valuable when sequence is available but in vitro propagation of the phage may not be practical or possible.
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) is a human oncogenic virus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman’s disease. KSHV ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle are not well understood. In this study, the authors found that ORF20 encodes three largely uncharacterized isoforms that are localized predominantly in the nuclei and nucleoli. They used quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry ( q-AP-MS ) to identify numerous specific interacting partners of ORF20, including ribosomal proteins and the interferon-stimulated gene product ( ISG ) oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein ( OASL ). Both endogenous and transiently transfected OASL co-immunoprecipitated with ORF20, and this interaction was conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses. Characterization of OASL interacting partners by q-AP-MS identified a very similar interactome to that of ORF20. Both ORF20 and OASL copurified with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, and when they were co-expressed, they associated with polysomes. Although ORF20 did not have a global effect on translation, ORF20 enhanced RIG-I induced expression of endogenous OASL in an IRF3-dependent but IFNAR-independent manner. OASL and ORF20 mRNA expression were induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuARLT-rKSHV . 219 cells. Intriguingly, the authors found that OASL enhanced infection of KSHV. During infection with a KSHV ORF20stop mutant, however, OASL-dependent enhancement of infectivity was lost. Their data have characterized the interaction of ORF20 with OASL and suggest ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection.
Lassa virus disease (LVD) is a viral infection that causes fever and convulsions in children. The prevalence of LVD in children with convulsions is not well known, especially in Nigeria. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of LVD in children with convulsions compared to those without convulsions. The study found that the overall prevalence of LVD was 3.5% in febrile children, but it was not significantly associated with convulsions. The study also found that vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD. The study highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion in the diagnosis of LVD in children with convulsions.
Drought is a major threat to crop production worldwide. To identify new factors that regulate drought resistance, we studied the role of KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) in Arabidopsis thaliana. KAI2 is a receptor for karrikins, a class of butenolide compounds found in smoke that promote seed germination. We found that kai2 mutants are hypersensitive to water deprivation, with increased rates of water loss, drought-induced cell membrane damage, and enlarged stomatal apertures. KAI2 also regulates cuticular permeability and anthocyanin biosynthesis during drought. We identified genes that are likely associated with these physiological changes through a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of kai2 under both well-watered and dehydration conditions. Our findings suggest that KAI2-dependent signaling may contribute to drought resistance in plants.
 Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in many developing countries. The currently available evidence emphasizes the relevance of developing a transmission blocking veterinary vaccine for use in bovines to reduce S. japonicum infection (or reinfection) and to decrease the force of transmission by interrupting female worm egg production. In this study, we show that human insulin can bind the L1 subdomain (insulin binding domain) of recombinant (r) SjIR1 and rSjIR2 (designated SjLD1 and SjLD2) produced using the Drosophila S2 protein expression system. We also show that, in addition to their reduced transcription, the transcript levels of other important downstream genes within the insulin pathway associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity were also impacted substantially. Furthermore, a significant decrease in glucose uptake was observed in the SjIR-knockdown worms compared with luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, we found that rSjLD1 and rSjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These data re-emphasize the potential of the SjIRs as veterinary transmission blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines.
 Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) is a leading cause of disability in South Pacific regions , where >96% of the 1 . 7 million population are at risk of LF infection . The current global campaign aims to eliminate LF through mass drug administration ( MDA ) , but mosquito vector biology can complicate the MDA strategy . In some regions , there is evidence that the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone . Obligate vector mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF transmission cycle , but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector throughout much of the South Pacific , Aedes polynesiensis . Here we demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an A . polynesiensis strain ( ‘CP’ strain ) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi . The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes , resulting in female sterility . Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive , resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A . polynesiensis populations . The findings demonstrate strategy feasibility and encourage field tests of the vector elimination strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts .
The study aimed to estimate the public health burden of rhodesiense HAT in terms of DALYs and financial costs in a highly disease endemic area of Tanzania using hospital records . The direct medical and other indirect costs incurred by individual patients and by the health services were calculated . DALYs were estimated using methods recommended by the Global Burden of Disease Project as well as those used in previous rhodesiense HAT estimates assuming HAT under reporting of 45% , a figure specific for Tanzania . The DALY estimate for HAT in Urambo District with and without age-weighting were 215 . 7 ( 95% CI: 155 . 3–287 . 5 ) and 281 . 6 ( 95% CI: 209 . 1–362 . 6 ) respectively . When 45% under-reporting was included , the results were 622 . 5 ( 95% CI: 155 . 3–1098 . 9 ) and 978 . 9 ( 95% CI: 201 . 1–1870 . 8 ) respectively . The costs of treating 143 patients in terms of admission costs , diagnosis , hospitalization and sleeping sickness drugs were estimated at US$ 15,514 , of which patients themselves paid US$ 3,673 and the health services US$ 11,841 . The burden in terms of indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients was estimated at US$ 9,781 . This study shows that HAT imposes a considerable burden on affected rural communities in Tanzania and stresses the urgent need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates tailored to particular rural settings in countries like Tanzania where a considerable number of infectious diseases are prevalent and , due to their focal nature , are often concentrated in certain locations where they impose an especially high burden .
 Ngly1 is a highly conserved cytoplasmic enzyme that removes N-glycans from misfolded glycoproteins during the ERAD process. Ngly1-deficient mice are embryonic lethal, and the additional deletion of Engase, another de-N-glycosylating enzyme, partially rescues the lethality. The phenotype of Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice resembles the symptoms of NGLY1-deficiency subjects. These observations suggest that Engase could be a potential therapeutic target for treating NGLY1-deficiency.
 The study investigates the noise generated during the expression of the hunchback gene (hb) in Drosophila embryos. The authors use a stochastic model of the hb promoter to determine the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output noise on promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics. The model is fit to data from WT embryos, the self-regulation mutant hb14F, and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the hb promoter. The results indicate that WT (self-regulatory) Hb output noise is predominantly dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than on Bcd fluctuations. The constructs and mutant, which lack self-regulation, indicate that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter (and their strengths) also play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to the variation in Bcd binding site number across a number of fly species. This study identifies particular ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb output noise. Insofar as many of these are common features of genes (e.g., multiple regulatory sites, cooperativity, self-feedback), the current results contribute to the general understanding of the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development.
 The genetic makeup of modern humans is a result of a long history of evolution and interactions with other species. One such species is the Neanderthal, a human ancestor that went extinct around 40,000 years ago. Despite their extinction, Neanderthal DNA can still be found in modern humans, with an average of 1.5-2.1% of their genome coming from Neanderthals. However, this percentage varies across different populations, with East Asians having slightly higher levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans. Researchers have found that selection has acted against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans, resulting in a non-uniform distribution of Neanderthal alleles along the genome. This is particularly evident in regions of high gene density or low recombination rate, where Neanderthal ancestry is lower than expected. The X chromosome and mitochondria also have lower levels of Neanderthal ancestry. Researchers have proposed that differences in effective population size may play a role in shaping levels of introgression. They developed a new method to estimate the average strength of selection against Neanderthal ancestry and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. They found that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. They propose that these alleles were effectively neutral in Neanderthals but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.
 HIV-1 is a highly successful virus that infects over 37 million people worldwide. After integration into the host genome, HIV-1 can establish a latent infection that persists for decades. The HIV-1 promoter is responsible for regulating viral gene expression and replication. In this study, the authors used a model lentivirus to investigate the role of specific cis-acting elements in the HIV-1 promoter in regulating viral gene expression. They found that mutations in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements had distinct effects on viral gene expression, with Sp1 mutations leading to increased noise and NF-κB mutations leading to decreased activation. These findings suggest that the interplay between different transcription factor binding sites in the HIV-1 promoter plays a crucial role in regulating viral gene expression and potentially in the establishment and maintenance of latency.
 In this study, we compared the accuracy of nine leading orthology prediction methods and two standard methods. We found that OMA and Homologene performed best in phylogenetic analysis, while OrthoMCL outperformed Ensembl Compara at lower functional specificity but higher coverage level. Lastly, EggNOG can be of interest to build broad functional grouping but is not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. We also introduced new methodology to verify orthology and set performance standards for current and future approaches. Our study provides guidance for the broad community of orthology data users as to which database best suits their needs and sets performance standards for current and future approaches.
 Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, is a 40-year-old drug with low efficacy against the juvenile stage of schistosomes, which makes it less effective in mass drug administration programs. To identify new targets for drug discovery, we developed a computational drug repurposing pipeline that combines remote homology detection techniques with detailed knowledge of the original drug-target interactions. We applied this pipeline to schistosomiasis to identify potential new targets and approved drugs that could inhibit them. We also elucidated the kinome of S. japonicum, completing the kinomes of all three major infective Schistosoma species of humans. Our findings suggest 22 novel schistosome potential targets and suggest approved drugs that could inhibit them. These include previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib, as well as newly identified drugs such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, and dinaciclib. Additionally, their primary and secondary targets are also suggested, which are important for maintaining the parasite's lifecycle.
 Transcription factors are central components of the intracellular regulatory networks that control gene expression. An increasingly recognized phenomenon among human transcription factors is the formation of structure upon target binding. Here, we study the folding and binding of the pKID domain of CREB to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. Our simulations of a topology-based Gō-type model predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism, and the existence of partially bound intermediates. From transition-path and Φ-value analyses, we find that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. A change of structure following binding is reminiscent of an induced-fit mechanism and contrasts with models in which binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist in the unbound state at equilibrium. Increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a “fly-casting”-like process. We find that the inclusion of attractive non-native interactions results in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding, but do not significantly change the binding mechanism. Our study helps explain how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition. The simulations are in general agreement with a recently reported nuclear magnetic resonance study, and aid in the interpretation of the experimental binding kinetics.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. It is a major public health problem in Latin America and the Caribbean, where it affects millions of people. The World Health Assembly has set a goal of eliminating schistosomiasis by 2020. To achieve this goal, it is important to have accurate information about the prevalence and intensity of infection in children. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries and territories. The study found that most of the data came from Brazil, and that there were several "hot spots" with high prevalence. The study also found that there was a need for updated epidemiological data to verify the elimination of transmission in some countries and territories.
 HIV-1 transmission is characterized by a genetic bottleneck that selects a single viral variant, the transmitted/founder (TF) virus, during most transmission events. To assess viral characteristics influencing HIV-1 transmission, we sequenced 167 near full-length viral genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones (IMC) including TF variants and multiple non-transmitted (NT) HIV-1 subtype C variants from six linked heterosexual transmission pairs near the time of transmission. We found a strong selection bias toward consensus sites across the entire genome, at both the amino acid and nucleotide level, in all six pairs. The TF variants were also more sensitive to neutralization by donor antibodies than NT variants. However, no evidence was found for TF variants exhibiting increased particle infectivity, replicative capacity, or IFN-α resistance when compared to the transmitting partner’s NT variants. Thus, in these six subtype C transmission pairs, the transmission potential of TF variants is not discriminated by inherent in vitro replicative capacity or interferon resistance, and may be determined by alternate phenotypes difficult to dissect in these in vitro systems.
 Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) is a debilitating disease caused by the parasitic nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi . It is characterized by lymphatic dilatation and obstruction, leading to irreversible lymphedema and elephantiasis in severe cases. The mechanisms underlying these pathologies are not fully understood, but it is known that the parasites alter the host's lymphatic integrity and function. In this study, human lymphatic endothelial cells ( LEC ) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected patient serum. Live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced both significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Moreover, serum from patently infected individuals and those with longstanding chronic lymphatic obstruction induced significantly increased LEC proliferation compared to sera from uninfected individuals. Differentiation of LEC into tube-like networks was found to be associated with significantly increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their TIMP inhibitors ( Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases ). The data suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis.
 The study of microbial ecology and evolution is greatly hindered by the fact that only a small fraction of environmental bacteria can be cultured in the lab . To overcome this limitation, researchers have turned to genomic sequencing directly from single cells . The Multiple Displacement Amplification ( MDA ) method allows for genome amplification from single cells isolated by FACS flow cytometry or by serial dilution . However, MDA suffers from two unwanted characteristics: nonspecific synthesis and uneven representation of the template. In a recent study, researchers used a combination of MDA and rolling circle amplification to achieve single-molecule amplification of circular 7-kb DNA templates, and demonstrated that improved specificity could be achieved by reducing the volume of the MDA reaction from the standard 50μl down to 600 nl . The effect of this reduction on amplification bias was not determined. In this study, the authors used a dedicated microfluidic chip with 60-nl reactors to isolate and amplify single-cell genomes. The microfluidic device has an integrated cell sorter to isolate selected individual cells, thereby allowing flexible sample selection and avoiding contamination. Parallel amplification of defined cells greatly reduces reagent consumption, making the process more economical. Direct pyrosequencing of the amplification product shows highly specific assembly and mapping onto the consensus genome. The authors conclude that this technique allows for significant improvement of the amplification specificity by strongly reducing the background amplification without requiring stringent reagent or sample handling protocols.
 Hantavirus is a pathogenic virus that is transmitted to humans through contact with infected rodents. The distribution of hantavirus hosts in the Atlantic Forest biome of South America is influenced by landscape structure, climate, and biodiversity patterns. We used geographically weighted regression models to test four main hypotheses for explaining hantavirus host proportions: 1) there is a positive correlation with the amount of agricultural matrix; 2) there is a positive relationship with the total habitat diversity of the landscape; 3) that the absence of predators and large competitors (defaunation intensity) and 4) local small mammal diversity would both increase hantavirus host proportions in rodent communities. We also explored the correlation between our modelled predictions of hantavirus host distributions and a vulnerability index of human populations to hantavirus infection based on public health surveillance data. Our findings suggest that hantavirus host proportions are more positively influenced by landscape diversity than by a particular habitat or agricultural matrix type. Local small mammal diversity also positively influences known pathogenic hantavirus host proportions, indicating that a plasticity to habitat quality may be more important for these hosts than competition with native forest dwelling species. We found a consistent positive effect of sugarcane and tree plantation on the proportion of rodent hosts, whereas defaunation intensity did not correlate with the proportion of hosts of potentially pathogenic hantavirus genotypes in the community, indicating that non-defaunated areas can also be hotspots for hantavirus disease outbreaks. Our analyses suggest there may be more complex rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease than currently hypothesized.
 The BCL2 family of proteins plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, a programmed form of cell death that removes damaged or unnecessary cells. In this study, we examined the roles of BCL2 proteins in the induction of apoptosis in cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. We found that survival of infected cells depends on the pro-survival protein BCLXL, which suppresses the expression of another pro-survival protein, MCL1. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors or deficiency of the BCLXL gene induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviviruses. Flavivirus infection attenuates cellular protein synthesis, which confers reduction of short-half-life proteins like MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, thereby suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. These results suggest that BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and that BCLXL may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress propagation of the family of Flaviviridae viruses.
 The economic burden of canine rabies in Vietnam has been estimated using data collected from personal interviews, published literature, published and supplementary reports, and primary data collection. The study found that over the 10 year study period (2005–2014), the total economic impact of canine rabies was over $719 million USD. The largest portion of impacts (92%) were made up of PEP-related costs. Canine rabies created between 36,500 and 45,700 DALYs, measured in years of life lost. A total of 914 human deaths were reported over the study period. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD. The results indicate that canine rabies impacts in Vietnam are consistent with the burden elsewhere reported in Asia, with large expenditures on PEP and very small investments in dog vaccination.
 The Type II Secretion System ( T2SS ) is a molecular machine that drives the secretion of fully-folded protein substrates across the bacterial outer membrane. We have identified three distinct forms of T2SSs based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. Detailed comparative analysis of two of these, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, showed them to be further distinguished by the pilotin that mediates their transport and assembly into the outer membrane. We have determined the crystal structure of the novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae , demonstrating convergent evolution wherein AspS is functionally equivalent and yet structurally unrelated to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins , enhances the kinetics of secretin assembly , and homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio as well those few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS. Our findings reveal that distinct classes of T2SS secretins can be recognized: one represented by the Klebsiella PulD which make use of PulS-OutS pilotins , and one represented by the Vibrio EpsD/GspD that makes use of AspS pilotins. We suggest that E . coli pathotypes that have acquired the Klebsiella-type secretin depend on PulS-OutS pilotins such as EtpO , whereas E . coli pathotypes that have acquired the Vibrio-type secretin depend on the AspS pilotin to assemble a functional T2SS.
 Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. that can be transmitted to humans through contaminated water. The infection process involves the ability of leptospires to adhere to cell surface and extracellular matrix components, a crucial step for dissemination and colonization of host tissues. In this study, we assessed the functional roles of three outer membrane proteins, OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47, which we recently identified on the leptospiral surface. We determined the capacity of these proteins to bind to host tissue components by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. OmpL37 binds specifically to human skin elastin, exhibiting dose-dependent, saturating binding to human skin and aortic elastin. It also binds fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. The binding to human skin elastin by both recombinant OmpL37 and live Leptospira interrogans is specifically enhanced by rabbit antiserum for OmpL37, suggesting the involvement of OmpL37 in leptospiral binding to elastin and also the possibility that host-generated antibodies may promote rather than inhibit the adherence of leptospires to elastin-rich tissues. Further, we demonstrate that OmpL37 protein is detected in pathogenic Leptospira serovars and not in saprophytic Leptospira. Thus, OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may be promoting attachment of Leptospira to host tissues.
4E10 and 2F5 are two broadly neutralizing antibodies that recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region ( MPER ) of gp41, a protein involved in HIV-1 fusion. These antibodies are polyreactive and bind to the viral membrane. The authors present a model to calculate the probability that during the pre-hairpin intermediate, a bound antibody will disable a trivalent gp41 before fusion is complete. They find that for these antibodies to be effective at neutralization, the time to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in this conformation. The authors investigate the role of avidity in neutralization and show that 2F5 IgG, but not 4E10, is much more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment. They use the model to elucidate the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and propose an extension of the model to analyze neutralization data. The extended model predicts the dependencies of for neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp41, and the number of gp41 bridging the virus and target cell at the start of the pre-hairpin intermediate. Analysis of neutralization experiments indicate that only a small number of gp41 bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion. However, the model cannot determine the exact number from neutralization experiments alone. , Introduction: HIV-1 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals. A subset of these bind to epitopes at the base of gp41, along a segment adjacent to the viral membrane known as the membrane proximal external region ( MPER ). Two of these mAbs, 4E10 and 2F5, have been extensively characterized. Each has been shown to be polyreactive, with an elongated heavy chain complementarity determining region that does not contact the peptide antigen. Recently, self-antigens have been identified that these antibodies recognize. Of the two mAbs, 2F5 interacts more strongly with membrane as demonstrated by its ability to bind to virus-like particles bearing no envelope glycoprotein. Detailed structural studies and surface plasmon resonance measurements have shown that the epitopes for 4E10 and 2F5 are within the MPER, lying along the viral surface with parts immersed in the viral membrane. The binding of these antibodies to their epitopes on the viral membrane appears to be step-wise. For both mAbs and their Fabs, the rate constants that describe the kinetics of the two step process have been determined for binding to liposome-gp41 peptide conjugates. The epitopes recognized by 4E10 and 2F5 on gp41 are displayed on the viral membrane after the binding of HIV-1 to the target cell has occurred and the processes that result in membrane fusion have begun. This stage, between pre- and postfusion, called the pre-hairpin intermediate, has a lifetime that has been estimated to range from a few seconds to many minutes. The tenet that 4E10 and 2F5 only recognize epitopes on the MPER during the pre-hairpin intermediate appears to strictly hold only for HIV-1 isolates that are highly resistant to neutralization. For HIV-1 isolates that are less resistant to neutralization, the MPER epitopes may be accessible to antibody binding before the pre-hairpin intermediate stage has been initiated. Alternatively, enhanced susceptibility to MPER neutralizing antibodies could be a result of prolonged exposure of the intermediate state during viral entry. Although numerous studies have determined rate constants for the binding of 4E10 and 2F5 to peptide epitopes in solution and peptides conjugated to liposomes, estimates of the lifetime of the exposure of the MPER on HIV-1 have been obtained, a quantitative description of how these parameters determine the mAb concentrations that are effective in inhibiting fusion has been lacking. Here we present a model that allows us to calculate, as a function of the serum antibody concentration, the probability that during the pre-hairpin intermediate, a trivalent MPER is disabled by polyreactive mAbs. A question we also consider is how the probability of disabling a single epitope is related to the probability of blocking membrane fusion of HIV-1 and target cell when, at the start of the pre-
 Onchocerciasis is a debilitating disease caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by blackflies. Ivermectin is the main drug used to control the disease, but it was not known if it could also interrupt transmission and eliminate the parasite in endemic foci in Africa where vectors are highly efficient. A longitudinal study was undertaken in three hyperendemic foci in Mali and Senegal with 15 to 17 years of annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment in order to assess residual levels of infection and transmission and test whether treatment could be safely stopped. This article reports the results of the final evaluations up to 5 years after the last treatment. Skin snip surveys were undertaken in 131 villages where 29,753 people were examined and 492,600 blackflies were analyzed for the presence of O. volvulus larva using a specific DNA probe. There was a declining trend in infection and transmission levels after the last treatment. In two sites the prevalence of microfilaria and vector infectivity rate were zero 3 to 4 years after the last treatment. In the third site, where infection levels were comparatively high before stopping treatment, there was also a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. All infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination. The study has established the proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa. The study results have been instrumental for the current evolution from onchocerciasis control to elimination in Africa.
 The common cold is caused by human rhinovirus (HRV), a non-enveloped virus that must deliver its RNA genome across the cell membrane to initiate infection. The mechanisms of HRV cell entry are poorly understood, but it is thought that the small myristoylated capsid protein VP4 is involved. In this study, we have produced recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged HRV VP4 and shown that it can induce membrane permeability in liposome model membranes. Dextran size-exclusion studies, chemical crosslinking, and electron microscopy demonstrated that VP4 forms a multimeric membrane pore with a channel size consistent with transfer of the single-stranded RNA genome. The membrane permeability induced by recombinant VP4 was influenced by pH and was comparable to permeability induced by infectious virions. These findings present a molecular mechanism for the involvement of VP4 in cell entry and provide a model system to facilitate exploration of VP4 as a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family.
 Francisella tularensis ( Ft ) is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes the severe and often fatal disease tularemia in humans . Infection can occur through skin contact , insect bite , or inhalation of contaminated air . Ft is classified as a category A bioterrorism agent due to its high infectivity and mortality , transmission by an airborne route of infection [1–3] , and development as a bioweapon . Francisella is categorized into numerous subspecies: tularensis ( Type A ) , holarctica ( Type B ) , mediasiatica , and novicida . Ft Type A and Type B cause disease in humans , with Type A being the most virulent . Francisella novicida ( Fn ) causes a severe disease in a murine model but is not virulent in immunocompetent humans . Interestingly , all subspecies share greater than 95% DNA sequence homology , suggesting a close genetic relationship and allowing Fn to be considered an acceptable model for studying Francisella LPS biosynthesis and pathogenicity [1 , 4] . Lipid A , the biologically active component of Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , is responsible for various pathological responses in Gram-negative bacterial infections [5–7] . Classical biphosphorylated , hexa-acylated lipid A species from Escherichia coli can activate pro-inflammatory responses through Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , while tetra- or penta-acylated lipid A species have significantly diminished immunostimulatory activity [5 , 8] . The lipid A molecule can be modified by the addition of various carbohydrates , removal of phosphate moieties , or variation in the length and/or order of fatty acid chains , altering recognition by the host innate immune system . Francisella LPS and lipid A molecules lack immunostimulatory activity and are not recognized by TLR2 or TLR4 [9 , 10] and display little to no endotoxic properties in galactosamine-treated mice , by limulus assay ( a standard for determining LPS endotoxin potential ) , after aerosolization in mice , or by stimulation of mononuclear cells to release cytokines [11–13] . The β- ( 1 , 6 ) -linked diglucosamine backbone structure of Francisella lipid A has amide-linked fatty acids at the 2 ( ( 18:0 ) -3-OH ) and 2′ positions and ester-linked fatty acids at the 3 ( ( 18:0 ) -3-OH ) , but not the 3′ positions [14–17] . A fatty acid ( 16:0 ) is attached to the 2′ fatty acid , forming an acyloxyacyl group ( ( 18:0 ) -3- ( 16:0 ) ) . Francisella subspecies lipid A has a single phosphate moiety at the 1 position of the reducing glucosamine residue . The phosphate is further substituted with the positively charged sugar galactosamine [15] , which was recently shown to be α-linked in Fn by Wang et al . [18] ( Figure 1B , m/z 1665 ) . Finally , the 4′ phosphate is absent and can be removed by the recently identified phosphatase LpxF [18] . In this study , we screened transposon-generated Fn mutants for enzymes involved in lipid A biosynthesis and modification . Two proposed dolichyl phosphate-mannose synthase-like enzymes , FlmF1 ( FTN_1403 ) and FlmF2 ( FTN_0545 ) , required for the synthesis of the undecaprenyl-phospho-mannose or galactosamine donor lipid , respectively , and a proposed glycosyltransferase enzyme , FlmK ( FTN_0546 ) , required for the addition of both mannose and galactosamine to lipid A , were identified . Fn mutants ( flmF2 and flmK ) were attenuated in mice after subcutaneous and pulmonary infection and provided protection against a lethal wild-type
The ribosome is a complex molecular machine that is essential for protein synthesis in all living organisms. In bacteria, the ribosome consists of two subunits, the 50S and 30S subunits. The 30S subunit is composed of 21 proteins and one rRNA molecule, while the 50S subunit is composed of 33 proteins and two rRNA molecules. The assembly of the ribosome is a tightly regulated process that requires the help of assembly cofactors. One such cofactor is the ribosome-associated GTPase Era, which is highly conserved across all domains of life. In this study, the authors show that Era is not essential for the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, but is important for the assembly of the 30S subunit. They also show that Era interacts with the endonuclease YbeY and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA, which are required for the processing and maturation of the 16S rRNA. The authors propose that Era is a protein that facilitates the interactions between a number of rRNA processing and degrading enzymes and the 30S subunit/16S rRNA. They also show that under stress conditions, the stringent response is important for this process.
 The study investigates the role of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) in anthrax lethal toxin ( LT )-mediated pathogenesis in mice. The study found that neuronal NOS ( nNOS ) deficiency in mice causes strikingly increased sensitivity to LT, while deficiencies in the two other NOS enzymes ( iNOS and eNOS ) have no effect on LT-mediated mortality. The increased sensitivity of nNOS−/− mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin, or cytokine responses, and could be replicated in nNOS-sufficient wild-type ( WT ) mice through pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme with 7-nitroindazole. Histopathological analyses showed that LT induced architectural changes in heart morphology of nNOS−/− mice, with rapid appearance of novel inter-fiber spaces but no associated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. LT-treated WT mice had no histopathology observed at the light microscopy level. Electron microscopic analyses of LT-treated mice, however, revealed striking pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS−/− and WT mice, varying only in severity and timing. Endothelial/capillary necrosis and degeneration, inter-myocyte edema, myofilament and mitochondrial degeneration, and altered sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae were observed in both LT-treated WT and nNOS−/− mice. Furthermore, multiple biomarkers of cardiac injury ( myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein ) were elevated in LT-treated mice very rapidly ( by 6 h after LT injection ) and reached concentrations rarely reported in mice. Cardiac protective nitrite therapy and allopurinol therapy did not have beneficial effects in LT-treated mice. Surprisingly, the potent nitric oxide scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, showed some protective effect against LT. Echocardiography on LT-treated mice indicated an average reduction in ejection fraction following LT treatment in both nNOS−/− and WT mice, indicative of decreased contractile function in the heart. The study reports the heart as an early target of LT in mice and discusses a protective role for nNOS against LT-mediated cardiac damage.
 The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been used to target and disrupt genes in many organisms, but it has not been successful in parasitic nematodes. We report the successful use of CRISPR-Cas9 to target and disrupt the unc-22 gene in the human-parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. We found that CRISPR-Cas9-induced double-strand breaks at Ss-unc-22 are resolved by homology-directed repair when an appropriate repair template is provided. In the absence of a repair template, we observed putative deletions of >500 base pairs at the target locus. We optimized CRISPR-Cas9 targeting conditions for S . stercoralis and demonstrated that Ss-unc-22 mutations are heritable. Our results pave the way for mechanistic studies of gene function in parasitic nematodes, which may enable the development of novel targeted therapies to improve human-parasitic nematode control.
 The phenomenon of ribosome drop-off plays a crucial role in translational accuracy and nutrient starvation responses during protein translation. When cells are under stress conditions, such as amino acid starvation or aminoacyl-tRNA depletion due to a high level of recombinant protein expression, ribosome drop-off can substantially affect the efficiency of protein expression. Here we introduce a mathematical model that describes the effects of ribosome drop-off on the ribosome density along the mRNA and on the concomitant protein synthesis rate. Our results show that ribosome premature termination may lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, such as a ribosome density which increases from the 5’ to the 3’ end. Importantly, the model predicts that the effects of ribosome drop-off on the translation rate are mRNA-specific, and we quantify their resilience to drop-off, showing that the mRNAs which present ribosome queues are much less affected by ribosome drop-off than those which do not. Moreover, among those mRNAs that do not present ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with the elongation rate, so that sequences using fast codons are expected to be less affected by ribosome drop-off. This result is consistent with a genome-wide analysis of S . cerevisiae , which reveals that under favourable growth conditions mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery, known to be highly codon biased and using preferentially fast codons, are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off. Moreover, in physiological conditions, the translation rate of mRNAs coding for regulatory, stress-related proteins, is less resilient to ribosome drop-off. This model therefore allows analysis of variations in the translational efficiency of individual mRNAs by accounting for the full range of known ribosome behaviours, as well as explaining mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.
Soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) are a group of parasitic worms that infect millions of people worldwide, particularly in developing countries. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has been working to control STH infections through mass drug administration ( MDA ) of antihelminthic drugs to school-aged children. However, this strategy may not be enough to eliminate STH infections, as transmission can continue even with high MDA coverage. The DeWorm3 trial is currently ongoing to test the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission through MDA. In this study, the authors used a mathematical model to simulate the DeWorm3 trial and investigate whether criteria to determine whether transmission interruption is unlikely can be defined at earlier timepoints. The authors found that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. Models suggest a tight range of homogenous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters which do not allow for discrimination between bounce-back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA.
 Cholera is a severe diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. There are two main serogroups of V. cholerae, O1 and O139, which can be further divided into subtypes based on differences in their O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The OSP is a key determinant of serogroup specificity and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cholera. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a cholera conjugate vaccine containing native OSP recovered from V. cholerae O1 in mice. We found that the vaccine was immunogenic and induced significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP and LPS. The vaccine also induced memory B cell responses and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model. Our findings suggest that a cholera conjugate vaccine containing native OSP recovered from V. cholerae O1 could assist in inducing long-term protective immunity, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.
 The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms, and bacterial-fungal interactions are likely to be important. Using a neutropenic mouse model of microbial gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination, we show that the fungus Candida albicans inhibits the virulence of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting P . aeruginosa pyochelin and pyoverdine gene expression, which plays a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. Accordingly, deletion of both P . aeruginosa pyochelin and pyoverdine genes attenuates P . aeruginosa virulence. Heat-killed C . albicans has no effect on P . aeruginosa, whereas C . albicans secreted proteins directly suppress P . aeruginosa pyoverdine and pyochelin expression and inhibit P . aeruginosa virulence in mice. Interestingly, suppression or deletion of pyochelin and pyoverdine genes has no effect on P . aeruginosa’s ability to colonize the GI tract but does decrease P . aeruginosa’s cytotoxic effect on cultured colonocytes. Finally, oral iron supplementation restores P . aeruginosa virulence in P . aeruginosa and C . albicans colonized mice. Together, our findings provide insight into how a bacterial-fungal interaction can modulate bacterial virulence in the intestine.
 HIV-1 and SIV are both RNA viruses that cause AIDS. These viruses mutate rapidly and often escape from the immune system by changing their genetic makeup. However, these mutations can also reduce the virus's ability to replicate. In this study, researchers infected pigtail macaques with a mixture of wild-type (WT) and escape mutant (EM) viruses and tracked how the proportion of WT virus changed over time. They found that if the initial mixture contained at least 10% WT virus, WT virus quickly became the dominant virus within 7 days. However, if the initial mixture contained much smaller proportions of WT virus, it took much longer for WT virus to become the dominant virus, and this was associated with lower viral loads. These findings suggest that the initial proportion of WT virus in the infecting inoculum determines the rate of reversion to WT virus and the outcome of infection. This information could be used to develop new strategies for controlling HIV-1 and SIV infections.
 The study of how organisms adapt to changing environments is a fundamental question in biology. In this study, we found that a set of yeast strains collected from Evolution Canyon in Israel exhibit an extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. We found that this enhanced cadmium resistance is primarily caused by an increased function of a metal efflux pump, PCA1. Molecular analyses revealed that this enhancement is largely due to mutations in the promoter sequence, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. We also found that the critical nucleotides found in these strains are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other species. However, these nucleotides had diverged in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which gave cells growth advantages under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. Our results provide a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance.
 We have developed an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in gastric cancer ( GC ) using gene expression signatures. We identified three oncogenic pathways ( proliferation/stem cell , NF-κB , and Wnt/β-catenin ) that were deregulated in the majority of GCs. We functionally validated these pathway predictions in a panel of GC cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions may play an important role in influencing disease behavior. Our results demonstrate that GCs can be successfully taxonomized using oncogenic pathway activity into biologically, functionally, and clinically relevant subtypes.
 Stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization ( SIDD ) is a process in which the stability of DNA is affected by the level of superhelicity in the DNA.  SIDD sites are regions of DNA that are more likely to open under stress.  We found that strong SIDD sites are more likely to be located in the upstream regions of genes that encode transcriptional regulators.  This suggests that SIDD sites may play a role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes.  We also found that this association is not present in endosymbionts or obligate parasitic bacteria.  This suggests that SIDD sites may be more important for prokaryotes that are capable of adapting to changing environments.  Overall, our findings suggest that SIDD sites may play a role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes in prokaryotes.
 High-mobility group ( HMG ) B proteins are a group of eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins that play a pivotal role in global genomic functions and in the control of genes involved in specific developmental or metabolic pathways . In the filamentous ascomycete Podospora anserina, there are 12 HMG-box genes, including four mating-type genes that control fertilization and development of the fruit-body, and a mitochondrial gene involved in mitochondrial DNA stability. Systematic deletion analysis of the eight remaining uncharacterized HMG-box genes indicated that none were essential for viability, but that seven were involved in the sexual cycle. Transcriptional analyses of HMG-box genes in HMG-box deletion strains indicated that PaHMG5 is at the hub of a network of several HMG-box factors that regulate mating-type genes and mating-type target genes. Genetic analyses revealed that this network also controls fertility genes that are not regulated by mating-type transcription factors. This study points to the critical role of HMG-box members in sexual reproduction in fungi, as 11 out of 12 members were involved in the sexual cycle in P . anserina. PaHMG5 and SpSte11 are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating-type genes, although P . anserina and S . pombe diverged 550 million years ago. Two HMG-box genes, SOX9 and its upstream regulator SRY, also play an important role in sex determination in mammals. The P . anserina and S . pombe mating-type genes and their upstream regulatory factor form a module of HMG-box genes analogous to the SRY/SOX9 module, revealing a commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi.
2013–2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic was unprecedented in terms of the number of cases and survivors. Prior to this epidemic, limited data was available on the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors’ body fluids and the potential risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. Given the urgent need to determine the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors’ body fluids, an observational cohort study was designed and implemented during the epidemic response operation in Sierra Leone. The study was conducted in two phases, assessing the persistence of virus in multiple body fluids of 120 men and 120 women. Data from this study informed national and global guidelines in real time and demonstrated the need to implement semen testing programs among Ebola virus disease survivors. The study tools developed accelerated the implementation of such programs in Ebola virus disease affected countries and also informed studies examining persistence of Zika virus. Research is a vital component of the public health response to an epidemic of a poorly characterized disease. Adequate resources should be rapidly made available to answer critical research questions in order to better inform response efforts.
 The bacterium Escherichia coli lives in a complex chemical environment in the human intestine. To understand what chemical gradients these bacteria typically encounter, we used information theory and simulations to predict the distributions of gradients. We found that the bacterial chemotaxis sensory system is optimized to detect broad distributions of exponential gradients, which lead to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. Our results provide a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex microenvironments, such as the human intestine.
 Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) are responsible for generating all mature blood cells throughout an individual's life. The lifespan of HSCs has been a topic of interest for many years, with some studies suggesting that HSCs are immortal and can self-renew indefinitely. However, recent research has shown that HSCs have a finite lifespan and that this lifespan is determined by the number of self-renewal cycles a HSC can undergo. The authors of this study used clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling to test the hypothesis that HSCs differ in their lifespan due to differences in their ability to self-renew. The results of the study suggest that HSCs with shorter lifespans have a higher probability of failure during self-renewal, while HSCs with longer lifespans have a lower probability of failure. The authors propose a new model based on reliability theory to account for the diversity of lifespans of HSCs. This model suggests that HSCs differ a priori in the number of self-renewal cycles they can undergo. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying HSC lifespan and may have important implications for bone marrow transplantation and other stem cell therapies.
 Helminth infections are a major global health burden, with no effective vaccines currently available. Antibodies and alternatively activated macrophages ( AAM ) are crucial components of protective immunity against helminth infections. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these large multi-cellular parasites remain obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that helminth-specific antibodies induce the rapid trapping of tissue migrating helminth larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following challenge infection with the natural murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri ( Hp ). Mice lacking antibodies ( JH−/− ) or activating Fc receptors ( FcRγ−/− ) harbored highly motile larvae, developed extensive tissue damage and accumulated less Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around the larvae. Moreover, Hp-specific antibodies induced FcRγ- and complement-dependent adherence of macrophages to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete larval immobilization. Antibody-induced expression of Arginase-1 in vitro and in vivo occurred independently of IL-4Rα signaling. In summary, we present a novel IL-4Rα-independent mechanism of alternative macrophage activation that is antibody-dependent and which both mediates anti-helminth immunity and prevents tissue disruption caused by migrating larvae.
DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) are a major threat to genome integrity . The most accurate way to repair DSB is homologous recombination ( HR ) with an intact copy of the broken locus . However, the dynamics of HR are not well understood. We have developed a new, non-intrusive method to visualize resection in single living cells. By applying it to HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, we provide the first real-time analysis of resection in single living cells. We find that resection begins with transient confinement of the damaged chromatin region. Resection in a yku70 mutant began ∼10 min earlier than in wild type, defining this as the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. Our new DNA-labelling and -targeting method will be widely applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization, dynamics and function in normal and pathological contexts.
 Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Reinfections by T. cruzi are possible in humans and can lead to lower or even hardly detectable parasitaemia. The frequency and timing of reinfections are not well understood. We used stochastic agent-based models to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and to assess how frequent are reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. The best model predicted 0.032 (0.008–0.042) annual reinfections per individual with 98.4% of them occurring in the chronic phase. In addition, the parasite escapes to the adaptive immune response mounted after the primary infection in at least 20% of the events of re-inoculation. With these low rates, the risks of reinfection during the typically long chronic stage of the disease stand around 14% (4%-18%) and 60% (21%-70%) after 5 and 30 years, respectively. These low rates are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission than a highly efficient adaptive immune response. These estimates are of particular interest for vaccine development and for our understanding of the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations suffered by infected people living in endemic areas.
Dengue fever is a viral infection that can cause severe illness in some cases. The majority of dengue infections are subclinical, meaning they do not cause any symptoms. However, some people who have had a subclinical infection in the past may develop severe dengue illness when they are infected again. Researchers have been trying to understand why this happens and what factors contribute to severe dengue illness. In this study, researchers collected blood samples from school-aged children in Thailand before and after the dengue season. They then stimulated the cells from the blood samples with dengue virus and measured the amount of 30 different cytokines produced by the cells. They found that there were significant differences in the amount of cytokines produced by the cells depending on the type of dengue virus used for stimulation and whether the children developed symptomatic dengue illness or not. These findings suggest that there may be differences in the immune responses of people who develop severe dengue illness compared to those who develop subclinical infections. These results may be useful for evaluating dengue vaccines and understanding the pathology of dengue fever.
 The Drosophila wing imaginal disc is a model system for studying pattern formation in developing tissues. The Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the wing disc by controlling the expression of target genes along the anterior-posterior axis. However, the relationship between Hh concentration and gene expression patterns has not been fully understood. In this study, we used mathematical modeling to investigate how Hh signaling patterns the wing disc. Our results suggest that the steady-state Hh gradient is insufficient to determine more than two gene expression patterns in a concentration-dependent manner. Instead, we propose that Hh-dependent Patched ( Ptc ) up-regulation causes a transient expansion ( or “overshoot” ) of the Hh gradient before approaching its final distribution. Through experiments conducted in vivo, we provide evidence that this transient overshoot exists and that it is required to distinguish different spatial domains of gene expression in response to Hh. Our findings suggest a new model of pattern formation that takes into consideration gradient dynamics to explain Hh-dependent patterning of the wing disc.
 Alcohol abuse is a major public health issue worldwide. The mechanisms by which ethanol and anesthetics influence the nervous system are poorly understood. In this study, we describe the positional cloning and characterization of a new mouse mutation isolated in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ( ENU ) forward mutagenesis screen for animals with enhanced locomotor activity. This allele, Lightweight ( Lwt ), disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans ( C . elegans ) unc-79 gene. While Lwt/Lwt homozygotes are perinatal lethal, Lightweight heterozygotes are dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C . elegans demonstrate a conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to the related unc-80 mutant and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants. Lightweight heterozygotes also exhibit an altered response to the anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc-79 invertebrate mutant phenotypes. In addition, Lightweight heterozygotes are mildly hyperactive when exposed to a novel environment and are smaller than wild-type animals. They also exhibit increased food consumption yet have a leaner body composition. Interestingly, Lightweight heterozygotes voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The acute hypersensitivity to and increased voluntary consumption of ethanol observed in Lightweight heterozygous mice in combination with the observed hypersensitivity to ethanol in C . elegans unc-79 , unc-80 , and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants suggests a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.
 The immune response of mosquitoes against Plasmodium falciparum , the causative agent of human malaria, has been identified as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms to be exploited in efforts to control the malaria transmission cycle. One such mechanism is the Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway that has potent anti-P . falciparum activity. Silencing the expression of caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, or over-expressing rel2, an Imd pathway-controlled NFkappaB transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on A . gambiae mosquitoes that involves an array of immune effector genes. However, unexplored features of this powerful mechanism that may be essential for the implementation of a malaria control strategy still remain. Using RNA interference to singly or dually silence caspar and other components of the Imd pathway, we have identified genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar, each of which represents a potential target to achieve over-activation of the pathway. We also determined that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, yet also has reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. We further demonstrated that caspar silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P . falciparum response even in the relative absence of resident gut microbiota. Finally, we established the relevance of the Imd pathway components and regulated effectors TEP1 , APL1 , and LRIM1 in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense, thereby shedding light on the relevance of laboratory versus natural infection intensity models. Our results highlight the physiological considerations that are integral to a thoughtful implementation of Imd pathway manipulation in A . gambiae as part of an effort to limit the malaria transmission cycle, and they reveal a variety of previously unrecognized nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P . falciparum.
 Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( BMMSCs ) are a promising therapy for fibrotic diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of BMMSCs in an experimental model of lung fibrosis caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. We found that BMMSCs did not have any anti-fibrotic effect, and in fact, their interaction with the fungus promoted collagen expression and tissue remodeling.
 The recent expansion of phlebotomine vectors of Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean subregion has been attributed to ongoing climate changes. The activity of sand flies is typically seasonal, and seasonal phenomena are sensitive to variations in climate. Therefore, current phenological data sets can provide a baseline for continuing investigations on sand fly population dynamics that may impact on future scenarios of leishmaniasis transmission. With this aim, in 2011–2013, a consortium of partners from eight Mediterranean countries carried out entomological investigations in sites where L . infantum transmission was recently reported. A common protocol for sand fly collection included monthly captures by CDC light traps, complemented by sticky traps in most of the sites. Collections were replicated for more than one season in order to reduce the effects of local weather events. Data from 99,000 collected specimens were analyzed, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies belonging to L . infantum vector species throughout a wide geographical area, namely P . perniciosus ( Portugal , Spain and Italy ) , P . ariasi ( France ) , P . neglectus ( Greece ) , P . tobbi ( Cyprus and Turkey ) , P . balcanicus and P . kandelakii ( Georgia ) . Time of sand fly appearance/disappearance in collections differed between sites, and seasonal densities showed variations in each site. Significant correlations were found between latitude/mean annual temperature of sites and i ) the first month of sand fly appearance, that ranged from early April to the first half of June; ii ) the type of density trend, varying from a single peak in July/August to multiple peaks increasing in magnitude from May through September . A 3-modal trend, recorded for P . tobbi in Cyprus , represents a novel finding for a L . infantum vector . Adults ended the activity starting from mid September through November, without significant correlation with latitude/mean annual temperature of sites. The period of potential exposure to L . infantum in the Mediterranean subregion, as inferred by adult densities calculated from 3 years , 37 sites and 6 competent vector species , was associated to a regular bell-shaped density curve having a wide peak center encompassing the July-September period , and falling between early May to late October for more than 99% of values. Apparently no risk for leishmaniasis transmission took place from December through March in the years considered . We found a common pattern of nocturnal females activity , whose density peaked between 11 pm and 2 am . Despite annual variations, multiple collections performed over consecutive years provided homogeneous patterns of the potential behavior of leishmaniasis vectors in selected sites , which we propose may represent sentinel areas for future monitoring . In the investigated years , higher potential risk for L . infantum transmission in the Mediterranean was identified in the June-October period ( 97% relative vector density ) , however such risk was not equally distributed throughout the region , since density waves of adults occurred earlier and were more frequent in southern territories .
 Orientia tsutsugamushi is a bacterium that causes scrub typhus, a life-threatening disease. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium that mainly infects endothelial cells. In this study, the authors demonstrated that O . tsutsugamushi also replicated in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. In addition, O . tsutsugamushi altered the expression of more than 4,500 genes, as demonstrated by microarray analysis. The expression of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes and genes associated with the M1 polarization of macrophages was significantly upregulated. O . tsutsugamushi also induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. Live organisms were indispensable to the type I interferon response and apoptosis and enhanced the expression of M1-associated cytokines. These data were related to the transcriptional changes detected in mononuclear cells isolated from patients with scrub typhus. Here, the microarray analyses revealed the upregulation of 613 genes, which included interferon-related genes, and some features of M1 polarization were observed in these patients, similar to what was observed in O . tsutsugamushi-stimulated monocytes in vitro. This is the first report demonstrating that monocytes are clearly polarized in vitro and ex vivo following exposure to O . tsutsugamushi. These results would improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of scrub typhus, during which interferon-mediated activation of monocytes and their subsequent polarization into an M1 phenotype appear critical. This study may give us a clue of new tools for the diagnosis of patients with scrub typhus.
The ability of ants to navigate through complex environments has been a topic of interest for many years. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this ability are still not well understood. In this study, we used a spiking neural model of the mushroom body neuropils in the ant brain to simulate the ability of ants to learn and remember visual routes. We found that the model was able to successfully learn and remember visual routes, even when the routes were complex and contained many turns. Our results suggest that the mushroom body neuropils in the ant brain may play a crucial role in visual navigation.
Plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms against disease. In this study, we developed a system to study pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis. We found that when Arabidopsis protects itself against drought by abscising its cauline leaves, it uses the same set of signaling components as are required for the shedding of flower petals after fertilization. We also found that the abscission receptor, HAE, utilizes SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES (SERK) as a co-receptor in the recognition of IDA peptide. Additionally, we found that the defense hormone salicylic acid (SA) likely regulates leaf shedding since a number of genes necessary for SA mediated defense are also necessary for the full leaf shedding defense response. Our findings suggest that leaf abscission is a bona fide defense mechanism against bacterial infection.
 The detection of image motion and the computation of its direction and speed is a major function of the visual system. In addition to being an intensely studied example of retinal signal processing, motion detection represents an important class of computational problems in neuroscience: the detection of spatiotemporal patterns. The retina's ability to detect the direction of motion was discovered more than 40 years ago when Barlow and his colleagues found direction-selective ganglion cells. It was later shown that starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which provide input to direction-selective ganglion cells, generate direction-selective Ca2+ signals in their dendrites. Optical recordings of visual stimulus-evoked Ca2+ signals also showed that dendritic sectors can be activated independently and that the strongest [Ca2+] increases are in the distal portions of the dendrites, near the output synapses. Electrical isolation of sectors from each other, which is necessary for dendritic processing to be local, is provided by the peculiar dendritic morphology of SACs and a low impedance at the soma. At least two fundamentally different mechanisms have been proposed for direction-selective computation in SAC dendrites: dendrite-intrinsic electrotonics and lateral inhibition. Despite extensive modeling, the physiological mechanism underlying intrinsic direction-selective computation in SAC dendrites has remained elusive. In this study, we focused on the electrical properties of SACs using whole-cell recording, two-photon imaging, and compartmental modeling. We show that direction-selective computation in SACs can be generated by a dendrite-autonomous mechanism that relies on active conductances and a somatodendritic voltage gradient.
43 different human pathogens from a range of taxonomic groups with diverse life-histories were analyzed to determine the relationship between infective dose and mode of action of molecules used by pathogens to infect hosts. It was found that pathogens using local action have lower infective doses, but are not less virulent than those using distant action. Instead, virulence was negatively correlated with infective dose, and higher in pathogens infecting wounded skin compared with those ingested or inhaled. These results show that broad-scale comparative analyses can explain variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence, while highlighting the importance of mechanistic details.
 Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis, a disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The most experimentally tractable schistosome species, S. mansoni, is used in this study to investigate the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in developmental processes. Using the "miRNA-blind" bioinformatics tool Sylamer, the authors analyzed the 3'-UTRs of transcripts differentially expressed between juvenile and adult worms. They found that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence is the only one significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. The authors also describe a novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, and propose hairpin folds for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. They found that sma-miR-4989 is expressed in tegumental cells located proximal to the oesophagus gland and also distributed throughout the male worms' body. The authors suggest that sma-miR-277/4989 might play a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during development of juvenile worms and an important role in the sexual development of female schistosomes.
 The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has been identified as a member of the Betacoronavirus genus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is believed to have originated from bats, but the exact origin of the virus is unknown. In this study, researchers conducted a 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with previous findings, revealed that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b were also discovered. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis showed evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. The researchers hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.
 Soil-transmitted helminths ( STHs ) are a major cause of morbidity in humans, particularly in developing countries. The faecal egg count reduction test ( FECRT ) is a widely used method for monitoring drug efficacy in STH infections. However, recent evidence suggests that density-dependent fecundity may affect the accuracy of the FECRT. Density-dependent fecundity refers to the phenomenon whereby the number of eggs laid by female worms decreases as the worm burden increases. This may lead to an underestimation of drug efficacy in the FECRT if surviving worms increase their egg output after treatment. The study examined the potential impact of density-dependent fecundity on the accuracy of the FECRT using recent evidence from hookworm infections in dogs and humans. The results suggest that density-dependent fecundity may affect the accuracy of the FECRT, particularly in cases where the worm burden is heavy. The study highlights the need for further research to better understand the impact of density-dependent fecundity on the accuracy of the FECRT and to develop alternative methods for monitoring drug efficacy in STH infections.
 We have shown that Heparan Sulfate ( HS ) synthetase Ext1 is required for lung branching morphogenesis in mice. We found that deletion of Ext1 in the lung epithelium resulted in expanded branching tips and reduced branching number, associated with several mesenchymal developmental defects. We also demonstrated an expanded Fgf10 expression and increased FGF signaling activity in Ext1 mutant lungs, suggesting a cell non-autonomous mechanism. Consistent with this, we observed reduced levels of SHH signaling which is responsible for suppressing Fgf10 expression. Moreover, reactivating SHH signaling in mutant lungs rescued the tip dilation phenotype and attenuated FGF signaling. Importantly, the reduced SHH signaling activity did not appear to be caused by decreased Shh expression or protein stability; instead, biologically active form of SHH proteins were reduced in both the Ext1 mutant epithelium and surrounding wild type mesenchymal cells. Together, our study highlights the epithelial HS as a key player for dictating SHH signaling critical for lung morphogenesis.
 We present a theoretical model for detecting genome rearrangements and fusion genes using paired-end sequencing. We derive a formula for the probability of detecting a fusion gene given a set of paired-end reads and use it to predict fusion genes in breast cancer samples. We find that we can accurately predict fusion genes with a relatively small number of large-size fragments. We also evaluate how different parameters of a sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection, breakpoint localization, and fusion gene detection. These results will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes that are enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies.
 In this study, we developed a mathematical model of chemotaxis that accounts for the coordinated action of separable but interrelated processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. We implemented the modules in terms of reaction-diffusion equations and demonstrated migration and accompanying changes in cellular morphology in simulations using a mechanical model of the cell cortex. The central module is an excitable network that accounts for random migration, while a local excitation, global inhibition module biases the direction in which excitability is directed. A polarization module linked to the excitable network through the cytoskeleton allows unstimulated cells to move persistently and for cells in gradients to gradually acquire distinct sensitivity between front and back. Finally, by varying the strengths of various feedback loops in the model, we obtained cellular behaviors that mirror those of genetically altered cell lines. Our model accounts for nearly all the reported observations of chemotaxing cells.
 Tudor containing protein 6 ( TDRD6 ) is a male germ line-specific protein essential for chromatoid body ( ChB ) structure and elongated spermatid development. Here we show that TDRD6 interacts with the key protein arginine methyl transferase PRMT5 , which supports splicing. TDRD6 also associates with spliceosomal core protein SmB in the absence of RNA and in an arginine methylation dependent manner. In Tdrd6-/- diplotene spermatocytes PRMT5 association with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are much reduced. TDRD6 deficiency impairs the assembly of spliceosomes, which feature 3 . 5-fold increased levels of U5 snRNPs. In the nucleus, these deficiencies in spliceosome maturation correlate with decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in nuclear snRNP maturation. Transcriptome analysis of TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes revealed high numbers of splicing defects such as aberrant usage of intron and exons as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions. Together, this study demonstrates a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes.
 The study of bacterial colonization dynamics is important for understanding the transmission of infectious diseases and the success of clinical decolonization protocols. However, determining whether two strains should be considered the same strain is challenging, especially when the genomes are closely related. Here, we present a fully Bayesian model that provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same strain, allowing us to determine bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. We demonstrate the method's utility by analyzing a large collection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genomes obtained through a clinical trial. The method provides a rigorous quantification of uncertainty and explicit statement of modeling assumptions, making it suitable for studies of the characteristics that impact colonization in the presence and absence of interventions.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of populations of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) initiates leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in highly ordered, spiralled, or whorled patterns via a process called phyllotaxis. It is commonly accepted that the active transport of the plant hormone auxin plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that cellular hormone transporters of the PIN family would create local auxin maxima at precise positions, which in turn would lead to organ initiation. To explain how auxin transporters could create hormone fluxes to distinct regions within the plant, different concepts have been proposed. A major hypothesis, canalization, proposes that the auxin transporters act by amplifying and stabilizing existing fluxes, which could be initiated, for example, by local diffusion. This convincingly explains the organised auxin fluxes during vein formation, but for the shoot apical meristem a second hypothesis was proposed, where the hormone would be systematically transported towards the areas with the highest concentrations. This implies the coexistence of two radically different mechanisms for PIN allocation in the membrane, one based on flux sensing and the other on local concentration sensing. Because these patterning processes require the interaction of hundreds of cells, it is impossible to estimate on a purely intuitive basis if a particular scenario is plausible or not. Therefore, computational modelling provides a powerful means to test this type of complex hypothesis. Here, using a dedicated computer simulation tool, we show that a flux-based polarization hypothesis is able to explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem as well, thus providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant. Further experiments are now required to distinguish between flux-based polarization and other hypotheses.
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that affects humans and animals. The visceral form of the disease, called kala-azar, is caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani and can be fatal if left untreated. Currently, the diagnosis of kala-azar relies on the detection of specific antibodies in the blood. However, these antibodies can persist even after successful treatment, making it difficult to determine whether a patient has been cured. To address this issue, researchers have been searching for new biomarkers that can be used to monitor the clinical status of patients with kala-azar. In this study, the researchers used a combination of genomic and bioinformatic approaches to identify potential biomarkers. They first compared the genomes of different Leishmania species to identify proteins that are unique to L. donovani. They then used bioinformatic tools to predict which of these proteins are likely to be recognized by human antibodies. Finally, they tested the most promising candidates in prototype diagnostic tests. The results of this study suggest that the protein rK28 could be a useful biomarker for monitoring the clinical status of patients with kala-azar.
 Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites that are transmitted by sandflies. The disease is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcers. The most common form of CL is caused by Leishmania major and Leishmania tropica, which are found in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and North Africa. The diagnosis of CL is usually made by a combination of clinical examination, microscopy, and molecular testing. In this study, we reviewed the clinical and microscopic data of 317 patients with CL from six different countries. We found that 195 (61.5%) of the cases had granulomas, which were divided into four types: caseating, suppurative, and tuberculoid without necrosis. The caseating and tuberculoid granuloma groups were significantly different in terms of the geographical source and the distribution of RP. The time needed to achieve healing was notably shorter in tuberculoid vs. caseating group. Parasitic Index, CL species, and other considered variables did not differ for the granuloma type groups. In our multiregional large cohort, a notable 18.2% of all CL cases harbored caseating granulomas, therefore; CL should be considered part of the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, especially considering that the regions included in our cohort are also endemic for TB. Of note, cases of CL with caseating granulomas also showed a slower healing process, with no association with specific species, which may be due to worse host immune response in such cases or to a more aggressive leishmania strains.
 Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease that results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In this study, the authors identified a candidate gene for a diabetogenic QTL in mice. The QTL, Nidd/SJL, was previously identified in an outcross population of New Zealand Obese (NZO) and SJL mice. The authors used congenic introgression and reporter crosses to identify a critical interval of distal chromosome 4 that conferred the diabetic phenotype. They then sequenced, qRT-PCR, and RACE-PCR 10 genes in the critical interval and found that Zfp69 was the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL. The authors also found that a retrotransposon in intron 3 of Zfp69 disrupted the gene in NZO and C57BL/6J mice, leading to the production of a truncated mRNA that lacked the coding sequence for the KRAB and Znf-C2H2 domains of Zfp69. When combined with the B6.V-Lepob background, the diabetogenic Zfp69SJL allele produced hyperglycaemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides. The authors conclude that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL and that retrotransposon IAPLTR1a contributes substantially to the genetic heterogeneity of mouse strains. Expression of the transcription factor in adipose tissue may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
 Th cell differentiation is a complex process that involves the interplay of multiple signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks. In this study, we propose an integrated and comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signaling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. We use a logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses and identify stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes. However, we also find that these subtypes coexist with other hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. Our logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships to canonical Th subtypes. This study provides a valuable resource for understanding the complex process of Th cell differentiation and its regulation.
 We have developed a thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding to evaluate the contribution of different biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster . Our model uses DNA sequence and in vitro protein-DNA affinities alone to achieve a correlation of ∼0 . 4 with experimental measurements of in vivo binding . Incorporating cooperativity and competition among the five factors , and accounting for spatial patterning by modeling binding in every nucleus independently , had little effect on prediction accuracy . A major source of error was the prediction of binding events that do not occur in vivo , which we hypothesized reflected reduced accessibility of chromatin . To test this , we incorporated experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into our model , effectively restricting predicted binding to regions of open chromatin . This dramatically improved our predictions to a correlation of 0 . 6–0 . 9 for various factors across known target genes . Finally , we used our model to quantify the roles of DNA sequence , accessibility , and binding competition and cooperativity . Our results show that , in regions of open chromatin , binding can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors , with a minimal role for protein interactions . We suggest that a combination of experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models of transcription factor binding may be used to predict the binding landscape of any animal transcription factor with significant precision .
 The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are important regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. The E protein family of bHLH transcription factors and their inhibitors, the Id proteins, regulate cell proliferation in metazoans. The Drosophila E protein orthologue Daughterless (Da) and the Id orthologue Extramacrochaetae (Emc) are the only members of these classes of bHLH proteins in Drosophila. Although these factors are involved in controlling proliferation, the mechanism underlying this regulatory activity is poorly understood. Through a genetic analysis, we show that during the development of epithelial cells in the imaginal discs, the G2/M transition, and hence cell proliferation, is controlled by Emc via Da. In eukaryotic cells, the main activator of this transition is the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. Our genetic analyses reveal that the ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Emc or high levels of Da is sufficient to rescue the proliferative defects seen in these mutant cells. Moreover, we present evidence demonstrating a role of Da as a transcriptional repressor of string. Taken together, these findings define a mechanism through which Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da, which transcriptionally represses string.
 Filamentous growth is a developmental transition observed in yeast cells that form elongated and connected multicellular filaments. This transition is induced in response to several cell stresses and is regulated by a number of signaling pathways. In this study, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify key proteins in specific pathways and discover protein-protein interactions that underlie the filamentous growth transition in yeast. We developed a comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for SILAC data that includes phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery. We applied this pipeline to our current yeast data and identified candidate proteins that contribute to the filamentous growth response. We validated these proteins by literature mining and inferred causal relationships between them. Our results suggest potential proteins that can be further intervened and studied in the future.
 The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes ( e.g., XY in males or ZW in females ) has repeatedly elicited the evolution of two kinds of chromosome-specific regulation: dosage compensation (e.g., equalization of X chromosome gene expression in males and females) and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) (e.g., transcriptional silencing and heterochromatinization of the X during meiosis in the male germline). How the X chromosome is regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster male germline is unclear. Here we report three new findings concerning gene expression from the X in Drosophila testes. First, X chromosome-wide dosage compensation appears to be absent from most of the Drosophila male germline. Second, microarray analysis provides no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis. Third, we confirm the previous discovery that the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes; but we show that this chromosomal difference in expression is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings help to resolve several previously conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.
 The study focused on the early dynamics and control of attachment and effacement (A/E) lesion development during Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice. The authors found that the initiation of colonic C. rodentium microcolonies is limited to a very early stage of infection and that these early-established, clonally-renewing A/E lesions trigger a local innate immune response that protects the epithelium from de novo A/E lesion formation by luminal bacteria. This local innate immune response critically determines disease severity and outcome. The study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of C. rodentium infection and highlights the importance of early immune responses in controlling intestinal pathogens.
β-diversity is a measure of the difference between two populations of species, taxonomical units, or gene variants. However, traditional methods for measuring β-diversity suffer from bias due to subsampling. Here, we developed a Bayesian method to estimate β-diversity from incomplete samples when the total number of objects in each population is known. Our method takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of β-diversity. We applied our method to the var family of P. falciparum, a malaria parasite. We found that our method produced more accurate estimates of β-diversity than traditional methods. We also developed a web tool and open-source code for our method.
 In this study, the authors used cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as a model to understand the intramolecular interactions that regulate the active state mechanics of eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs). They found that the previously identified salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix is not essential for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for the active state mechanics. The authors also identified an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. They further showed that the highly conserved β3-lysine is not required for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for the active state mechanics. The authors used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular modeling, and a thermal shift assay to decipher the interactions required for the mechanics of the catalytic cycle as well as phosphoryl transfer. Their findings provide a new understanding of the intramolecular interactions that regulate the active state mechanics of EPKs.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti and transmitted by mosquitoes. The Global Programme to Eliminate LF recommends conducting Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) to assess recent transmission after mass drug administration (MDA). Two survey designs were compared in American Samoa: a school-based survey of children aged 6–7 years and a community-based survey of people aged ≥8 years. The school-based survey identified nine antigen-positive children and found an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7%. Of the nine positive children, one was microfilariaemic. The community-based survey identified 102 antigen-positive people and estimated an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2%. Adjusted village-level prevalence ranged from 0–47.1%. School-based TAS had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but had high specificity and positive predictive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. American Samoa failed the school-based TAS in 2016, and the community-based survey identified higher than expected numbers of antigen-positive people. School-based TAS was logistically simpler and enabled sampling of a larger proportion of the target population but the results did not provide a good indication of the overall CFA prevalence in older age groups and was not sensitive at identifying foci of ongoing transmission. The community-based survey identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission.
 Sex determination is the process by which an animal decides whether it will develop as a male or a female. In vertebrates, sex determination is generally divided into two phases: primary and secondary. Primary sex determination is the process by which the primordial gonad commits to either an ovary or a testis developmental fate. Secondary sex determination is the process by which the somatic tissues of the organism differentiate with sex-specific characteristics. In zebrafish, primary sex determination appears to be regulated by a ZZ/ZW genetic system, though the gene (s) involved has not been identified. By contrast, several studies have concluded that the most commonly used domesticated zebrafish strains lack any major genetic sex determinant, and instead rely on a polygenic system that is strain dependent. However, even in wild strains where the W chromosome is necessary for female primary sex determination, it is not absolutely correlated with female development, as a fraction of ZW individuals develop as males. These results show that while a genetic sex determining system can strongly influence the outcome of sex determination in zebrafish, it is not an absolute prerequisite. In addition, oocytes are required for primary female sex determination and throughout adult life to maintain the differentiated female state. In the present study, we test whether the oocyte-expressed signaling molecules Gdf9 and Bmp15 have any role in female sex determination or maintenance of female sex differentiation in zebrafish. We find that bmp15 mutant females initially have normal development, but during the juvenile stage, oocytes are degraded after they arrest at early stages, and the premeiotic germ cells switch to a spermatogenic program as the gonad transforms to a fully functional testis. Consequently, all bmp15 mutant adults are fertile males. Additionally, we find that by mutational analysis, the somatic gonad-expressed Cyp19a1a aromatase, an enzyme responsible for estrogen production by the ovary, is required for female sexual development because all mutant animals develop as males. Interestingly, we find that in wild-type ovaries, cyp19a1a is initially expressed in theca cells, but not granulosa cells that surround early stage oocytes, but then is upregulated in granulosa cells that surround stage II oocytes. In bmp15 mutants, by contrast, cyp19a1a expression in theca cells is apparently normal, but we do not detect its expression in granulosa cells. Together, these results argue that bmp15 functions to maintain female sex determination, in part by promoting cyp19a1a expression, and therefore estrogen production, by granulosa cells. To our knowledge, this is the first instance in a vertebrate of the identification of a germ cell–derived signal that is required for maintaining a specific sexual phenotype.
 Hox proteins are transcription factors that play a crucial role in controlling morphogenesis along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals. They regulate distinct sets of target genes in a highly localized manner, sometimes even only in a single cell. In this study, we analyzed the regulation of the cell death gene reaper ( rpr ) by the Hox protein Deformed ( Dfd ) and found that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. This suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements could be responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets. Thus, a large number of transcription factors are likely to be directly involved in Hox target gene regulation in vivo.
Plants have a two-layered immune system that protects them from pathogens. The first layer is called MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI), which is activated by the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The second layer is called effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which is activated by the recognition of effectors by NB-LRR proteins. In this study, the authors studied the genetic requirements for defense responses of an autoactive mutant of ADR1-L2, a coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein. They found that the autoactive mutant requires an intact P-loop, which is a conserved homology region necessary for proper plant NB-LRR activity. The authors also found that the autoactive mutant is negatively regulated by EDS1 and AtMC1, and that its transcriptional regulation is correlated with its phenotypic outputs. These findings provide insight into an SA-dependent feedback regulation loop, which includes ADR1-L2.
 DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation is mediated by the RdDM (RNA-directed DNA methylation) pathway, which involves the production of noncoding RNAs that guide DNA methylation. In this study, we found that the SU(VAR)3-9 homolog SUVH9 and the double-stranded RNA-binding protein IDN2 are components of the RdDM pathway that interact with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. We also found that other RdDM components, including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2, are required for transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. These results suggest that DNA methylation is linked to heterochromatin condensation and thereby enhances transcriptional silencing at methylated genomic regions.
 The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a stress-response protein that helps maintain protein homeostasis in cells. In this study, the authors used zebrafish as a model organism to investigate the role of Hsp90 in developmental anomalies. They found that partial inhibition of Hsp90 function in zebrafish led to the uncovering of previously unobserved developmental anomalies, including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and coloboma. These anomalies were caused by missense mutations in different genes, and the severity of the anomalies was modified by Hsp90 inhibition. The authors also found that Hsp90 inhibition could ameliorate the severity of some developmental anomalies. These findings suggest that Hsp90 plays a role in the development of certain anomalies and that its inhibition can modify the severity of these anomalies.
 N-terminal acetylation is a common modification of proteins that occurs during protein synthesis. It is important for protein folding, stability, and function. However, the biological function of N-terminal acetylation is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the N-terminal peptides of proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and found that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. We also identified the ( X ) PX rule, which indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances. We used this rule to genetically modify a protein to study the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation. Our results suggest that N-terminal acetylation is important for protein folding and function.
 RNA polymerase III ( RNAP III ) is a multisubunit enzyme that synthesizes small RNAs such as tRNAs, which are essential for protein synthesis.  RNAP III terminates transcription at specific sequences called terminators, which are usually short tracts of nucleotides.  The termination process involves multiple subunits of RNAP III, including C11, which is required for efficient termination and reinitiation.  In this study, the authors used two genetic screens to identify mutations in the largest subunit of RNAP III, Rpc1, that affect termination.  They found that mutations in the bridge helix and trigger loop of Rpc1, as well as in the pore entrance and funnel, affect termination efficiency.  The authors also found that mutations in the trigger loop increase elongation rate, while mutations in the pore entrance and funnel increase transcription output.  These findings suggest that the mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including C11, are key determinants of termination and that some of the mutations activate RNAP III for overall transcription.  The authors propose a kinetic coupling model in which elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency.  These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of RNAP III termination and transcription regulation.
 The ability of cells to respond to internal and external cues depends largely on reversible post-translational modifications of proteins, such as phosphorylation. SH2 domains are responsible for recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine residues and play an important role in signal transduction. Experiments using peptide libraries indicate that each SH2 domain binds a different spectrum of phosphopeptides. However, the genome-wide determination of the binding specificity of SH2 domains using peptide libraries seems impractical. We developed a method to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm. Our approach performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices at predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. We used our method to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure filtered on secondary structure and phosphorylation state. We validated the predictions using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions. Our predictions lead to a new hypothesis for the role of SH2 domains in signaling.
 The accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Intrinsically disordered proteins, like tau, are enriched with proline residues that regulate both secondary structure and aggregation propensity. Cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), a proline isomerase, dissolves tau amyloids in vitro and ameliorates silver-positive and oligomeric tau species in a mouse model of tau accumulation, preserving neuronal health and cognition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed that CyP40 interacts with tau at sites rich in proline residues. CyP40 was also able to interact with and disaggregate other aggregating proteins that contain prolines. Moreover, CyP40 lacking PPIase activity prevented its capacity for disaggregation in vitro. Finally, we describe a unique structural property of CyP40 that may permit disaggregation to occur in an energy-independent manner. This study identifies a novel human protein disaggregase and, for the first time, demonstrates its capacity to dissolve intracellular amyloids.
 Heterocyst differentiation is a process of cellular differentiation in which a subset of cells in a filament of cyanobacteria differentiate into specialized nitrogen-fixing cells. This process is regulated by a genetic circuit that controls the expression of specific genes. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the genetic circuit that controls heterocyst differentiation. We show that the model can reproduce the main features of the process, including the formation and maintenance of heterocyst patterns. We also show that noise plays an important role in the onset of differentiation. Our work provides insight into the mechanisms underlying heterocyst differentiation and highlights the importance of noise in the development of complex biological systems.
 Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease that causes skin lesions and blindness. The Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program has been implemented in Cameroon since 2005 to control the disease. However, despite the program's success in reducing the prevalence of onchocerciasis, it is still above the non-transmission threshold in some regions. This study aimed to explore the association between people's beliefs and perceptions of the CDTI program and their adherence to ivermectin in three regions of Cameroon. The study found that people who had a positive opinion of the program were more likely to adhere to ivermectin than those who had a negative opinion. The most common misconception about onchocerciasis transmission was the lack of hygiene, especially in Bafia and Yabassi. In Bafang, high proportions of people believed that onchocerciasis was due to high consumption of sugar. The study highlights the importance of addressing misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission and involving communities in the implementation of the CDTI program.
 Epigenetic alterations have been associated with disease status, but it is unclear if they are directly causal for disease pathogenesis. In this study, we combined SNP and DNA methylation data with measurements of protein biomarkers for cancer, inflammation, or cardiovascular disease to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation on biomarker levels. We identified 124 and 45 loci with effect sizes up to 0.22 standard units’ change per 1% change in DNA methylation levels and up to four standard units’ change per copy of the effective allele in the EWAS and GWAS respectively. Most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory whereas most EWAS loci were located in trans. We present associations between protein biomarker and DNA methylation levels at numerous loci in the genome. The associations are likely to reflect the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represent secondary effects to the pathogenesis of disease.
 We have discovered that varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) can directly inhibit the function of natural killer ( NK ) cells, which are important anti-viral immune effectors. VZV can infect NK cells and render them unresponsive to target cell stimulation, leading to a loss of both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This impairment of function was dependent on direct contact between NK cells and VZV infected inoculum cells. Furthermore, we found that VZV also differentially targeted cytokine production compared to herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ). Our findings provide the first evidence that multiple aspects of NK cell anti-viral function are directly targeted for immune evasion by two human alphaherpesviruses.
 Apparent motion ( AM ) is a visual illusion where two stimuli presented alternately at different locations are perceived as a single stimulus moving continuously between the two locations. The neural mechanism underlying this illusion is not well understood. Some studies have suggested that increased activation of primary visual cortex ( V1 ) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path is responsible for the illusion. However, other studies have failed to find evidence for this. In this study, the authors used a computational model to investigate the neural mechanism underlying AM. They found that the model that incorporated only AM-related activation was not able to account for the observed masking effects. Instead, a model that incorporated strong suppression of responses to stimuli on the AM path captured the observed masking effects, arguing in favor of predictive coding theory.
 The HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in CD4+ T cell transformation by promoting cell proliferation and survival through permanent activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of many NF-κB target genes. Elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism is therefore critical in understanding HTLV-1-mediated transformation. We reconstituted Tax-stimulated IKK activation in a cell-free system to dissect the essential cellular components for primary IKK activation by Tax and studied the underlying biochemical mechanism. We found that Tax is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, which together with UbcH2, UhcH5c, or UbcH7, catalyzes the assembly of free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains. These free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains are then responsible for direct IKK activation by binding to the NEMO subunit of IKK. Our studies revealed the biochemical function and the underlying mechanism of Tax in the process of IKK activation, which utilizes the minimal cellular ubiquitination components for NF-κB activation.
 The propagule pressure hypothesis suggests that the number of individuals introduced to a new environment is a key determinant of the success of an alien species. However, the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been largely unexplored. We conducted a systematic and quantitative review of this relationship using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success for all taxa and life histories. However, the relationship was most critical for propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. We also found that studies conducted at spatial scales on which data can be directly measured produced larger effect sizes than those that relied on data that contained inconsistencies and reporting errors. Proxies for components of propagule pressure produced relatively weaker effect sizes than direct measures. Our analyses revealed remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success.
 Interleukin-17A (IL-17) is a cytokine that enhances the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the decay of their encoding mRNAs. The decay of many of these mRNAs depends on proteins called AUBps that target AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of mRNAs. Here we show that AUBps and the target mRNA assemble in a novel ribonucleoprotein complex in the presence of microRNA16 (miR16), which leads to the degradation of the target mRNA. IL-17 attenuates miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBps over that of destabilizing AUBps, reducing mRNA decay. These findings indicate that miR16 independently of a seed sequence, directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBps for target mRNAs. Since AUBps affect expression of about 8% of the human transcriptome and miR16 is ubiquitously expressed, IL-17 may in addition to inflammation affect many other cellular processes.
 The study aimed to investigate the relationship between human T . b . rhodesiense infection and human infective and non-human T . brucei s . l . circulating in cattle at village level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda. The study was undertaken in villages that had reported a case of sleeping sickness in the six months prior to sample collection and those villages that had never reported a case of sleeping sickness. The sleeping sickness status of the villages had a significant effect with higher odds of infection in cattle from case than from non-case villages for T . brucei s . l . ( OR: 2 . 94 , 95%CI: 1 . 38–6 . 24 ) . Cattle age had a significant effect ( p<0 . 001 ) on the likelihood of T . brucei s . l . infection within cattle: cattle between 18–36 months ( OR: 3 . 51 , 95%CI: 1 . 63–7 . 51 ) and cattle over 36 months ( OR: 4 . 20 , 95%CI: 2 . 08–8 . 67 ) had significantly higher odds of T . brucei s . l . infection than cattle under 18 months of age . Furthermore , village human sleeping sickness status had a significant effect ( p<0 . 05 ) on the detection of T . b . rhodesiense in the village cattle herd , with significantly higher likelihood of T . b . rhodesiense in the village cattle of case villages ( OR: 25 , 95%CI: 1 . 2–520 . 71 ) . Overall a higher than average T . brucei s . l . prevalence ( >16 . 3% ) in a village herd over was associated with significantly higher likelihood of T . b . rhodesiense being detected in a herd ( OR: 25 , 95%CI: 1 . 2–520 . 71 ) .
 The nervous system combines visual and physical motion cues to estimate our body movement for the control of posture. Here we show that the optimal strategy for combining these cues is to weight visually perceived movement velocities proportional to a power law. We find that this model accounts for the nonlinear influence of experimentally induced visual motion on human postural behavior both in our data and in previously published results. Our results suggest that the nervous system may use a power law to combine sensory cues for the control of posture.
 Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in each repeat. We have generated transgenic mice carrying D4Z4 arrays from an FSHD1 allele and from a control allele. These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. In addition, we show that DUX4 is able to activate similar functional gene groups in mouse muscle cells as it does in human muscle cells. These transgenic mice therefore represent a valuable animal model for FSHD and will be a useful resource to study the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD and to test new therapeutic intervention strategies.
 The malaria vaccine candidate AMA1 induces protection against parasites that are closely related to the vaccine, but not against more distant strains. To overcome this problem, a vaccine containing four diverse allelic proteins (3D7, FVO, HB3, and W2mef) was developed and tested. The vaccine induced broadly inhibitory antibodies that were associated with increased conserved face and domain-3 responses and reduced domain-2 response. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies raised against the vaccine reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1, which mapped to the conserved face of AMA1. Another novel mAb, which bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and it blocked the proteolytic processing of AMA1. By itself, the epitope of a previously characterized 3D7-specific mAb was partially conserved across strains. The study suggests that a vaccine containing multiple diverse antigenic proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes.
 The asymmetric division of cells is a fundamental process in development and is essential for many biological processes. In this study, the authors investigate the timing of asymmetric cell division in the one-cell stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. They found that the mitotic spindle displaces to an asymmetric position at a precise time during mitosis, and that this displacement is regulated by the mitotic progression mechanism. The authors show that reducing the function of the proteasome, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), or its activator Cdc20/Fizzy delays spindle displacement, while inactivating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) in prometaphase causes the spindle to displace early. The authors conclude that the mitotic spindle is displaced at a specific time during mitosis to ensure that it is fully assembled before it begins to move. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate asymmetric cell division and may have important implications for understanding the development of multicellular organisms.
 High-altitude hypoxia is a severe environmental stress that affects the human body. Two regions where humans have adapted to high altitude are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we used a genome scan to identify genes that show evidence of positive natural selection in these two populations. We found that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are dangerous events that can lead to genetic instability and cell death. To prevent this, cells have evolved several pathways to repair DSBs accurately. However, some pathways can lead to genetic instability, such as break-induced replication (BIR). Inverted DNA repeats (IRs) are a type of repeated sequence that can interfere with DSB repair and promote BIR. In this study, the authors used IRs to investigate the effects of IRs on DSB repair in yeast. They found that IRs can promote BIR by interfering with the repair of DSBs via gene conversion. The authors also found that the length of the spacer between IRs affects the type of repair that occurs. IRs separated by a long spacer promote BIR, while IRs separated by a short spacer promote gene conversion. The authors suggest that the choice of repair pathway is important for maintaining genome stability.
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium that can cause both acute and chronic infections in humans. Chronic infections are thought to be caused by biofilms, which are complex communities of bacteria that form a protective matrix. To study the role of biofilms in chronic infections, researchers used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. They found that P. aeruginosa forms biofilms in the crop of infected flies, and that these biofilms are associated with increased resistance to antibiotics and decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides. The researchers also found that the Toll and Imd pathways, which are important for the immune response in Drosophila, are involved in the host response to P. aeruginosa biofilm infections. Overall, this study provides new insights into the host-pathogen interactions during P. aeruginosa biofilm infections and highlights the potential of Drosophila as a model organism for studying these infections.
 The vasopressin 1a receptor ( V1aR ) is a G-protein coupled receptor that mediates many of the behavioral effects of arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) . The neural distribution of V1aR varies across species and within species, and this variation is thought to contribute to species-specific behaviors. The vasopressin 1a receptor gene ( Avpr1a ) has a 5′ flanking region that contains regulatory sequences that contribute to species-specific expression patterns. In addition, the Avpr1a gene contains a polymorphic microsatellite element within the 5′ flanking region that is thought to contribute to individual variation in gene expression. Using homologous recombination in mice, we replaced 3.4 kb of the 5′ flanking region of the mouse Avpr1a gene with the corresponding prairie vole sequence. We found that the 5′ flanking region is not sufficient to confer species-typical binding patterns, but is sufficient to quantitatively change expression levels in a direction consistent with species differences in binding. We also found that alterations in receptor binding are associated with differences in coping strategy in the forced swim test but not with differences in learning and memory in the novel object recognition task. Our results suggest that both the 5′ flanking region and the microsatellite element contribute to species-specific expression patterns and individual variation in gene expression.
 Transcription of the switch ( S ) regions of immunoglobulin genes in B cells generates stable R-loops that are targeted by Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase ( AID ) , triggering class switch recombination ( CSR ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , stable R-loops are formed co-transcriptionally in mutants of THO , a conserved nuclear complex involved in mRNP biogenesis . In this study, we devised a yeast chromosomal system based on different segments of mammalian S regions and c-MYC for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements in both wild-type and THO mutants . We demonstrate that AID acts in yeast at heterologous S and c-MYC transcribed sequences leading to double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) which in turn cause chromosomal translocations via Non-Homologous End Joining ( NHEJ ) . AID–induced translocations were strongly enhanced in yeast THO null mutants , consistent with the idea that AID–mediated DSBs depend on R-loop formation . Our study not only provides new clues to understand the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability , but it shows that yeast cells have the factors and pathways required to channel AID-mediated DNA lesions into DSBs responsible for NHEJ-dependent genome rearrangements and CSR .
 In this study, we investigated how Escherichia coli cells with asymmetrically placed cell division planes partition their chromosomes during cell division. We found that the DNA translocase FtsK can pump as much as 80% of the chromosome (3.7 Mb of DNA) from one daughter compartment to another at an average rate of about 1700 bp/s. The majority of DNA transport occurs only after the early arriving Z-ring components have dissociated from the division septum and cell constriction has closed to a narrow channel with a diameter smaller than the resolution limit of an optical microscope (~250 nm). Our findings suggest that the narrow constriction is needed for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK.
 Epitope-based vaccines ( EVs ) are a promising approach for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases. The selection of epitopes is a critical step in the development of EVs, and it is often performed manually. However, this approach is time-consuming and may not always yield the best results. In this study, we propose an integer linear programming approach to select the optimal set of epitopes for an EV. Our approach takes into account various factors, such as the immunogenicity of the epitopes, the population coverage, and the antigen coverage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to a simple greedy heuristic and a genetic algorithm. Our results show that our approach outperforms the other methods in terms of overall immunogenicity and population coverage.
 HIV-1 is primarily transmitted through vaginal intercourse, and semen is more than just a carrier of the virus. It contains many biological factors, including cytokines, that may affect HIV-1 transmission. One such cytokine is IL-7, which is found in high concentrations in semen and is further increased in semen of HIV-1-infected men. In this study, we investigated the potential role of IL-7 in HIV-1 vaginal transmission using an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue. We found that IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue. Similarly, we observed an enhancement of HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues showed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion and prevented apoptosis, as shown by the decrease in the number of cells expressing the apoptotic marker APO2 and the increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Also, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells, as evidenced by staining for the nuclear factor Ki-67. These findings suggest that high levels of seminal IL-7 in vivo may be relevant to the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection.
 Zika virus ( ZIKV ) is an arbovirus that causes a range of diseases in humans, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for ZIKV, two RNA interference ( RNAi ) pathways are involved in antiviral responses: the PIWI-interacting RNA ( piRNA ) and exogenous short interfering RNA ( exo-siRNA ) pathways. In this study, we found that ZIKV induced the production of both virus-specific siRNAs and piRNAs in Ae . aegypti mosquito cells. However, silencing of the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 ( Ago2 ) did not enhance virus replication. In contrast, increased replication was observed in a Dcr2 knockout cell line, suggesting that the exo-siRNA pathway is implicated in the antiviral response. We also found that ZIKV capsid protein amplified the replication of an alphavirus-based reporter system but did not display exo-siRNA pathway inhibition. These findings are important in understanding this specific arbovirus-vector interaction and may support efforts to understand the rapid spread of this virus.
 Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis that is endemic in certain regions of the world, including Brazil. Recent changes in the taxonomy of Sporothrix schenckii have led to the identification of four new species in the Sporothrix complex: S . globosa, S . brasiliensis, S . mexicana, and S . luriei. In this study, the authors analyzed Sporothrix isolates from 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They found that S . brasiliensis was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection without underlying disease, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection, while patients with S . schenckii presented with less severe and more often localized disease. The authors also found that S . brasiliensis-infected patients required shorter durations of itraconazole treatment compared to patients with S . schenckii. These findings suggest that Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and that S . brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole.
 In recent years, it has been reported that a much larger portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed than can be accounted for by currently annotated genes. However, the quantity and nature of these additional transcripts remains unclear. Here, we have used data from single- and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in PolyA+ RNA from human and mouse tissues. We found that most of the intergenic transcripts are in introns, raising the possibility that they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. The majority of intergenic seqfrags correspond to either single reads that display characteristics of random sampling from a low-level background or several thousand small transcripts present at higher levels, which also tend to display sequence conservation and originate from regions with open chromatin. We conclude that while there are bona fide new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance is generally low in comparison to known exons, and the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.
 The ability to design thermostable proteins is crucial for many applications in biotechnology and medicine. In this study, a combined computational and experimental method was developed to increase the thermostability of the Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain by 31°C. The method includes five steps: single mutant computer screening, experimental evaluation, computational redesign, experimental reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination. The method is simple, effective, and can be applied to other important proteins where other methods have difficulties. The study provides a new tool to improve protein thermostability and has important implications for biotechnology and medicine.
 We report the results of a study on the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of sand flies in the tropical forests of the Panama Canal area. We used DNA sequences to identify 18 species of Lutzomyia sand flies, two of which were found to carry Leishmania at high frequency. We also detected Wolbachia in three of 20 species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania. Our study provides a basis for understanding the spread of leishmaniasis in the region and for developing strategies to control the disease.
 Our study shows that ERK-mediated reactivation of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is dependent on the mitogen and stress activated kinase ( MSK ) family. Furthermore, this MSK-mediated response is dependent on CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter ( MIEP ). Specifically, CREB binding to the MIEP provides the target for MSK recruitment. Importantly, MSK-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. Taken together, these data suggest that CREB is necessary for the recruitment of the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate the chromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for reactivation. Thus, the importance of CREB during HCMV reactivation is to promote chromatin modifications conducive for viral gene expression as well as acting as a classical transcription factor.
 The production of ribosomes is essential for life, but defects in ribosome biogenesis can lead to a variety of diseases, including craniofacial anomalies. We previously found that the protein NOL11 is important for ribosome biogenesis in human cells. Here, we show that NOL11 is also important for craniofacial development in frogs. We found that NOL11 is expressed in the developing cranial neural crest, a structure that gives rise to many craniofacial tissues. When we knocked down NOL11 in frogs, we saw impaired pre-rRNA transcription and processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal development of craniofacial cartilages. These defects were partially rescued by inhibiting p53, a protein that is activated in response to DNA damage and can trigger apoptosis. Our findings suggest that NOL11 plays an important role in craniofacial development and that defects in ribosome biogenesis can lead to craniofacial anomalies.
 Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease worldwide . The lack of an accurate diagnostic test is a major barrier for diagnosis, especially during the early stages of illness, when antibiotic therapy is most effective . In order to identify new targets that could be used as diagnostic markers for leptospirosis, we constructed a protein microarray chip comprising 61% of Leptospira interrogans proteome and investigated the IgG response from 274 individuals, including 80 acute-phase, 80 convalescent-phase patients and 114 healthy control subjects from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis. We found 16 antigens that can discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Some of the antigens identified in this study, such as LipL32, the non-identical domains of the Lig proteins, GroEL, and Loa22 are already known to be recognized by sera from human patients, thus serving as proof-of-concept for the serodiagnostic antigen discovery approach. Several novel antigens were identified, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215 which showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients. Our study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptospiral infection, and novel as well as known serodiagnostic leptospiral antigens that are recognized by antibodies in the sera of leptospirosis cases were identified. The novel antigens identified here may have potential use in both the development of new tests and the improvement of currently available assays for diagnosing this neglected tropical disease. Further research is needed to assess the utility of these antigens in more deployable diagnostic platforms.
 In this study, we investigated the role of melanization in mosquito defense against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana . We found that melanization is a potent immune effector mechanism in mosquitoes that retards significantly B . bassiana growth and dissemination . We also identified the key positive regulators of melanization in mosquitoes, including TEP1 and CLIPA8, and showed that melanization is a cell-mediated process that requires the recruitment of phenoloxidase to fungal surfaces. Our findings suggest that melanization is an important immune response in mosquitoes that may be exploited to design transgenic fungi with more potent bio-control activities against mosquitoes.
 Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a major global health concern, with over 100 million cases annually. Mosquitoes are the primary vectors of DENV, and the development of new methods to reduce DENV transmission is urgently needed. Here, we investigated the use of chemical inhibitors to block DENV infection in adult mosquitoes. We found that the inhibitors bafilomycin and mycophenolic acid were effective in reducing DENV infection in the mosquito midgut and salivary glands. These inhibitors target the vacuolar H+-ATPase and inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase, respectively, which are essential for DENV replication and transmission. Our findings suggest that chemical inhibitors could be used as a novel approach to reduce DENV transmission in mosquitoes.
 The brain is a complex organ that is constantly changing in response to its environment. One of the ways that the brain responds to changes is through changes in cell volume. In this study, we used a mathematical model to explore how changes in cell volume affect neuronal behavior. We found that changes in cell volume can cause neurons to switch between different types of activity, including epileptic seizures and spreading depression. We also found that the way that neurons respond to changes in cell volume can vary depending on the geometry and microenvironment of the neuron. These findings suggest that changes in cell volume may play an important role in brain function and that understanding how cell volume affects neuronal behavior could lead to new ways of treating brain disorders.
 Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a systemic granulomatous mycosis that is endemic to South America. In this study, the authors found that murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells responded to P. brasiliensis yeast cells infection by releasing IL-1β in a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), caspase-1 and NLRP3 dependent manner. In addition, P. brasiliensis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was dependent on potassium (K+) efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification and cathepsin B release. Finally, using mice lacking the IL-1 receptor, the authors demonstrated that IL-1β signaling has an important role in killing P. brasiliensis by murine macrophages. Altogether, the results demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome senses and responds to P. brasiliensis yeast cells infection and plays an important role in host defense against this fungus.
 Toxoplasma gondii is a common brain-tropic parasite that infects most nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons, in vitro. However, in vivo, Toxoplasma is primarily found in neurons. In vitro data suggest that astrocytes clear intracellular parasites, while neurons lack this ability, leading to the hypothesis that neurons are persistently infected in vivo. Using a novel Toxoplasma-mouse model, we found that Toxoplasma shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection. This predilection remains in the setting of IFN-γ depletion, infection with parasites resistant to the major mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites, or when directly injecting parasites into the brain. These findings strongly suggest that neurons are not incidentally infected but rather are Toxoplasma’s primary in vivo target.
2D free-boundary models of actin-myosin contractility have been used to study the dynamics of lamellipodial motility in epithelial keratocytes. The models account for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which in turn reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and the balance of the protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium. The model analysis shows that initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, which represent myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When the contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories, and the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. Scanning of a model parameter space shows that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell.
 We present a novel approach to assess the confidence levels of interactions in protein-protein interaction ( PPI ) networks obtained from experimental studies. Our approach is based on a geometric random graph model of PPI networks. We use it to predict new interactions and guide future biological experiments. We apply our approach to de-noise a high confidence PPI data set for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and predict 251 interactions in the human PPI network. We validate a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. Our approach is compared with existing PPI network post-processing techniques. Proteins form interactions with each other based on their biochemical properties. Mathematically, we can consider these properties to be dimensions of some abstract metric space. Therefore, PPI networks reside in some biochemical space with finite number of dimensions. We choose low-dimensional Euclidean boxes and the Euclidean distance norm to construct geometric random graphs with the number of nodes equal to that of a PPI network; we chose that makes the number of edges in the geometric graph equal to the number of edges in the PPI network. Euclidean space is chosen only as a proof of concept; it is likely that customized models would provide better fits, at the expense of model complexity. It is well known that geometric random graphs constructed using 2-dimensional Euclidean space cannot contain certain types of induced bipartite subgraphs that appear to be abundant in the currently available PPI networks. However, increasing the dimension of the Euclidean space makes more subgraphs possible, in particular, the complete bipartite graph based on two sets of two and three nodes is allowed in three dimensions. Note that there is a bias coming from experimental “spoke” model used for detecting protein interactions, which will necessarily introduce small bipartite graphs containing false positives in the data. Also, nothing prevents geometric graphs from being scale-free. The random geometric graph model matches PPI networks in terms of various global and local network properties such as pathlengths, clustering coefficients, relative graphlet frequency distance, and graphlet degree distribution. We have also designed an algorithm to test directly whether PPI networks are geometric by embedding them into a low dimensional Euclidean space. The algorithm is based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling, with pathlengths playing the role of Euclidean distances. The embedding is “successful” if it assigns to nodes of a network a set of points in space such that adjacent nodes in the network correspond to points that are close in space, whereas non-adjacent nodes correspond to points that are further away in space. Given such an embedding, we are able to reconstruct the original network by choosing a distance cutoff, which also controls sensitivity and specificity. We applied this algorithm on 19 PPI networks of various organisms that were produced by a range of biological techniques with various confidence levels. The algorithm successfully embedded these networks into a low-dimensional space, thus supporting the hypothesis that PPI networks are geometric.
200-300 words. More than 20 human diseases are caused by simple DNA repeat expansions, including myotonic dystrophy (DM1) caused by CTG repeat expansions. Recent work has revealed that many human genes have anti-sense transcripts, raising the possibility that human trinucleotide expansion diseases may be caused by pathogenic activities due to both sense and anti-sense expanded-repeat transcripts. We established a Drosophila model for DM1 and tested the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG repeat transcripts. These studies revealed dramatically enhanced toxicity in flies co-expressing CTG and CAG expanded repeats. Expression of the two transcripts led to novel pathogenesis with the generation of dcr-2 and ago2-dependent 21-nt triplet repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted the expression of CAG-containing genes such as Ataxin-2 and TBP, which bear long CAG repeats in both fly and man. These findings indicate that the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may dramatically enhance toxicity in human repeat expansion diseases in which anti-sense transcription occurs.
Soft rot disease is a major problem for potato growers worldwide. In this study, we investigated the phylogeny and virulence of the soft rot model Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, which was isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the early 1980s. Genomic approaches, including proteome and genome comparisons of all sequenced soft rot bacteria, revealed that SCC3193 can now be more accurately classified as Pectobacterium wasabiae. Experimentally established virulence determinants include the putative transcriptional regulator SirB, two partially redundant type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters (Vic1 and Vic2), which contain predicted virulence genes. Genome comparison also revealed other interesting traits that may be related to life in planta or other specific environmental conditions. These traits include a predicted benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase of eukaryotic origin. The novelties found in this work indicate that soft rot bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits that may be utilized in the poorly understood latent stage in planta. The genomic approaches and the comparison of the model strain SCC3193 to other sequenced Pectobacterium strains, including the type strain of P. wasabiae, provides a solid basis for further investigation of the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria and, potentially, other bacteria as well.
ρ0 cells are mitochondria-depleted cells that are used as a model to study mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we used network analysis to investigate the systemic alterations of ρ0 cells. We found that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that ρ0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. Our results demonstrate that mt protein composition changed to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. Human mt protein functional networks provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.
 We developed a general method to deduce the in-vivo rates of a multistep process from their in-vitro values. The method has two basic components: the kinetic distance, a new concept that allows us to quantitatively compare the kinetics of a multistep process in different environments, and the minimization of the kinetic distance between the in-vitro and in-vivo processes, imposing the constraint that the deduced rates reproduce a known global property such as the overall in-vivo speed. We applied this method to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. We determined all individual transition rates in vitro and predicted the in-vivo rates by minimizing the kinetic distance between the in-vitro and in-vivo processes. We validated these rates by three independent sets of in-vivo data, obtained for codon-dependent translation speeds, codon-specific translation dynamics, and missense error frequencies. In all cases, we found good agreement between theory and experiment without adjusting any fit parameter. Our method is relatively simple from a computational point of view and can be applied to any biomolecular process for which we have detailed information about the in-vitro kinetics.
 The study aimed to estimate the short-term mutation and recombination rates in Helicobacter pylori by sequencing an average of 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates. These isolates included 34 pairs of sequential samples, which were sampled at intervals of 0.25 to 10.2 years, and 29 individuals (average age: 45 years) from 10 families. The accumulation of sequence diversity increased with time of separation in a clock-like manner in the sequential isolates. The study used Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the rates of mutation, recombination, mean length of recombination tracts, and average diversity in those tracts. The estimates indicate that the short-term mutation rate is 1.4×10−6 (serial isolates) to 4.5×10−6 (family isolates) per nucleotide per year and that three times as many substitutions are introduced by recombination as by mutation. The long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5–17-fold lower, partly due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations due to purifying selection. The study compared its results with the recent literature and found that short-term mutation rates vary dramatically in different bacterial species and can span a range of several orders of magnitude. The study also found that the short-term mutation rate is higher in Helicobacter pylori than in other bacteria, which may reflect the lack of genes encoding the MutHLS1 mismatch repair system. The study also found that recombination is more frequent in Helicobacter pylori than in other bacteria, which may reflect the lack of genes encoding the MutHLS1 mismatch repair system.

 The discovery of a third class of photoreceptors, called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs), has changed our understanding of mammalian vision. These cells are able to respond to light even in complete isolation thanks to the presence of melanopsin, an opsin-based photopigment. Until now, the discovery of mRGCs has had the most impact on our understanding of sub-cortical light responses such as circadian entrainment and the pupil light reflex. However, there has been little consideration of melanopsin's potential to contribute to the physiology or function of conventional visual pathways. In this study, we use a Cre-recombinase based reporter line to trace the projection pattern of the full mRGC population. We reveal a substantial innervation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the site of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. We continue to assess the physiological consequences of this anatomical organization using multichannel extracellular electrophysiology and brain imaging in the visual thalamus and cortex. Our experiments reveal an essential role for mRGCs in encoding irradiance for the central pathways of conventional vision. These findings identify mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicate that they may support vision in people suffering retinal degeneration.
 HIV-1 infection is associated with an early and profound depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, a population that plays an indispensable role in the regulation of isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies. In this study, we addressed whether the depletion of CD4+ T cell in HIV-1-infected individuals results in altered humoral responses specific to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces. We found that intestinal secretions of antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals exhibited a significant elevation of IgM levels and decreased IgA/IgM and IgG/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to a variety of microbial and food antigens. These findings indicate reduced competence of mucosal B cells for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to changing antigenic variety in the gut lumen. Decreased availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may be an important factor contributing to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination that drives chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals.
 In many ecosystems, populations of species are constrained by the availability of resources in their environment. This means that the growth of one population must be balanced by a comparable reduction in populations of others. In neutral models of biodiversity, all populations are assumed to change incrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here, we propose and model a different redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe reductions in the size of the population of a single species, which frees up resources for the remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant, for example, for communities of bacteria with strain-specific collapses caused by invading bacteriophages or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an important role. The emergent dynamics of our system is characterized by cyclic “diversity waves” triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species abundances have a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the lower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced species while the upper peak is composed of species that has not yet collapsed in the current wave. In most waves, both upper and lower peaks are composed of several smaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term memory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7. We show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in the rules of our model, such as diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.
 The chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli is highly optimized for efficient movement up a gradient of attractant. However, a recent study showed that the tumbling angle of E. coli depends on the number of switching flagellar motors. This study used computer simulations to investigate the effect of this dependence on the chemotactic efficiency of E. coli. The simulations showed that the difference in tumbling angle between swimming up and down the gradient is only a few degrees, but this small difference significantly improves the chemotactic efficiency of E. coli. The authors suggest that this additional navigation mechanism is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria with similar chemotaxis behavior.
 The thymus is a specialized organ that produces T cells, which are essential for the immune system. The thymus has a unique stromal microenvironment that is required for T cell development. Thymic epithelial cells ( TECs ) are the major component of the stromal microenvironment and play a crucial role in T cell development. There are two types of TECs: cortical TECs ( cTECs ) and medullary TECs ( mTECs ). cTECs promote the maturation of immature T cells, while mTECs present self-peptides to T cells and delete autoreactive T cells. The NFκB signaling pathway is essential for mTEC development and proliferation. Here, we show that the Stat3 signaling pathway also plays a key role in regulating mTEC development and homeostasis. We used a constitutively active Stat3 transgene and a conditional Stat3 knockout mouse model to investigate the role of Stat3 in mTEC development and homeostasis. We found that enforcing Stat3 signaling in mTECs increased mTEC cellularity and expanded the thymic medulla. In contrast, deleting Stat3 in mTECs reduced mTEC cellularity and impaired medullary region formation. We also found that Stat3 activation is required for mTEC survival, but not for proliferation. Our findings suggest that Stat3 signaling plays a crucial role in regulating mTEC development and homeostasis.
 In this study, we used an in silico approach to identify small noncoding RNAs ( sRNAs ) in Clostridium difficile and then confirmed their expression using RNA-seq and differential 5′-end RNA-seq. We identified 251 putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans riboregulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. We also detected abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C . difficile CRISPR loci. Our findings provide a basis for future RNome characterization and identification of molecular mechanisms of sRNA-based regulation of gene expression in this emergent enteropathogen.
 Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that causes chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. The HCV genome is composed of a long open reading frame ( ORF ) that is flanked by untranslated regions ( UTRs ) at both the 5′ and 3′ ends. The ORF encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3010 amino acids that is processed by cellular and viral proteases into 10 polypeptides. MicroRNA-122 ( miR-122 ) is the most abundant miRNA in the liver and binds to two closely spaced target sites in the 5′-UTR of the HCV genome to promote viral RNA stability and accumulation. The HCV core protein inhibits GLD-2's terminal mononucleotidyl transferase activity, resulting in the downregulation of miR-122 isomers bearing non-templated 3′-end single-nucleotide additions and thereby the dysregulation of miR-122 function. Our results demonstrate a novel role of the HCV core protein in regulating viral replication and translation through GLD-2-mediated miR-122 stability control.
 Trypanosomes are parasites that cause disease in humans and livestock throughout sub-Saharan Africa . Although various species show evidence of clinical tolerance to trypanosomes , until now there has been no evidence of acquired immunity to natural infections . We discovered a distinct peak and decrease in age prevalence of T . brucei s . l . infection in wild African lions that is consistent with being driven by an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with the more genetically diverse species , T . congolense sensu latu . The causative agent of human sleeping sickness , T . brucei rhodesiense , disappears by 6 years of age apparently in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes , including the non-pathogenic subspecies , T . brucei brucei . These findings may suggest novel pathways for vaccinations against trypanosomiasis despite the notoriously complex antigenic surface proteins in these parasites .
 The coagulation cascade is a complex system that plays a crucial role in human health. It is composed of a family of serine proteases (factors) and a key group of blood cells (platelets), which are normally inactive in the circulation. Insufficient coagulation can lead to disorders such as haemophilia, while unwanted clotting can be a serious complication following surgical intervention. Mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the working hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades can be computationally screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. The model of the coagulation cascade was validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. The predicted sensitive mechanisms were then compared with the treatment literature. The results support the prediction that computationally derived points of fragility of human-relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty.
 Phage therapy is the use of bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents for the control of pathogenic and other problem bacteria . In this study, we have combined experimental and modelling approaches to make a detailed examination of the non-linear kinetics of phage–bacteria interactions for the important food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni and a suitable virulent phage in an in vitro system . We find that even an apparently simplistic model fits the data surprisingly well, and we confirm that the so-called inundation and proliferation thresholds are likely to be of considerable practical importance to phage therapy. We fit the model to time series data in order to estimate thresholds and rate constants directly. A comparison of the fit for each culture reveals density-dependent features of phage infectivity that are worthy of further investigation. Our results illustrate how insight from empirical studies can be greatly enhanced by the use of kinetic models: such combined studies of in vitro systems are likely to be an essential precursor to building a meaningful picture of the kinetic properties of in vivo phage therapy.
 Schistosomiasis is a devastating disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma . Schistosomes must undergo their larval development within specific species of snail intermediate hosts, a trait that is shared among almost all digenean trematodes. This unique and long-standing host-parasite relationship presents an opportunity to study both the importance of conserved immunological features in novel immunological roles, as well as new immunological adaptations that have arisen to combat a very specific type of immunological challenge. While it is well supported that the snail immune response is important for protecting against schistosome infection, very few specific snail immune factors have been identified and even fewer have been functionally characterized. Here, we provide the first functional report of a snail Toll-like receptor (TLR) that we demonstrate as playing an important role in the cellular immune response of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata following challenge with Schistosoma mansoni. This TLR (BgTLR) was identified as part of a peptide screen of snail immune cell surface proteins that differed in abundance between B. glabrata snails that differ in their compatibility phenotype to challenge by S. mansoni. Transcript expression of BgTLR was found to be very responsive in BS-90 snails when challenged with S. mansoni, increasing 27 fold relative to β-actin (non-immune control gene) ; whereas expression in susceptible M-line snails was not significantly increased. Knockdown of BgTLR in BS-90 snails via targeted siRNA oligonucleotides was confirmed using a specific anti-BgTLR antibody and resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, yielding patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails, which shed S. mansoni cercariae 1-week before the susceptible controls. Our results represent the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR and demonstrate that BgTLR is an important snail immune receptor that is capable of influencing infection outcome following S. mansoni challenge.
 Aedes mosquitoes are a major threat to human health and wellbeing in French Polynesia, where they transmit infectious diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. To assess the risk of disease transmission or the efficacy of vector control programs, a new immuno-epidemiological tool was developed to detect and quantify human antibodies directed against proteins from the salivary glands of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis. The ELISA test revealed that 98% and 68% of individuals in Tahiti and Moorea, respectively, had developed IgG directed against Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis salivary gland extracts. By comparison, ELISA tests conducted on a cohort of people from metropolitan France not exposed to these mosquitoes indicated that 97% of individuals had no IgG directed against SGE of either species. The analysis of additional cohorts representing different entomological Aedes contexts showed no ELISA IgG cross-reactivity between Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE. The IgG response to salivary gland extracts seems to be a valid and specific biomarker of human exposure to the bites of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis. This new immuno-epidemiological tool will enhance our understanding of people's exposure to mosquito bites, facilitate the identification of areas where disease transmission risk is high, and permit the evaluation of novel vector control strategies in Pacific islands and other tropical settings.
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) is a highly successful pathogen that causes tuberculosis ( TB ). The success of Mtb as a pathogen is attributed to its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment of human macrophages . To understand this process, we used metabolic flux profiling to compare the metabolic responses of macrophages infected with different strains of Mtb. Our results showed that Mtb infection led to the regulation of a subset of host metabolic pathways that were involved in both host cell survival and mycobacterial sustenance. This regulation resulted in an axis where both host- and pathogen-derived factors converged to define determinants of pathogenicity. We found that the requirement for host cell survival sensitized TB susceptibility to the glycemic status of the individual, while mediation by the pathogen ensured that the virulence properties of the infecting strain also contributed towards the resulting pathology. Our findings suggest that Mtb pathogenicity is intimately linked to its capacity to regulate host cell metabolism.
 The ZIP3 protein is required for crossover recombination in budding yeast and is thought to couple recombination with synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly. In Caenorhabditis elegans, ZHP-3 is the ortholog of ZIP3 and is required for crossover recombination but not for SC assembly. We show that ZHP-3 protein localization is highly dynamic during meiotic prophase. At a key transition point in meiotic prophase, the protein shifts from along the length of the SC to an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually becomes restricted to foci that mark crossover recombination events. A ZHP-3::GFP transgene partially complements a null mutation and reveals a separation of function; although the fusion protein can promote nearly wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among the progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting that the chromosome segregation defect results from an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. We propose that coordination of crossover recombination with SC morphogenesis reflects a conserved role of Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with chromosome segregation.
 Aedes albopictus is a tropical invasive mosquito species that has spread worldwide, including temperate regions of Europe and the US. In Rome, Italy, Ae . albopictus was introduced in 1997 and has become a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and severe nuisance problems. The present study investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Ae . albopictus abundance and dynamics in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites in Rome. Results showed an association between highly anthropized habitats and high adult abundance both in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas, with "small green islands" corresponding to hot spots of abundance in the metropolitan areas only, and a bimodal seasonal dynamics with a second peak of abundance in autumn due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures. These findings provide useful indications to prioritize public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact, and risk of local arbovirus transmission are likely higher.
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) is a major human pathogen that causes tuberculosis ( TB ). The cell envelope of Mtb plays a major role in its pathogenesis. Phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( DIM ) are major virulence factors of Mtb, particularly during the early step of infection when bacilli encounter their host macrophages. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of DIM remain unknown. Using Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis, we demonstrated that DIM participate both in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. The effects of DIM required a state of the membrane fluidity as demonstrated by experiments conducted with cholesterol-depleting drugs that abolished the differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification observed between wild-type and mutant strains. The insertion of a new cholesterol-pyrene probe in living cells demonstrated that the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core changed upon contact with Mtb whereas the lateral diffusion of cholesterol was unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and was consistent with the effect observed following DIM insertion in model membrane. Therefore, we propose that DIM control the invasion of macrophages by Mtb by targeting lipid organisation in the host membrane, thereby modifying its biophysical properties. The DIM-induced changes in lipid ordering favour the efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and contribute to the control of phagosomal pH driving bacilli in a protective niche.
The brain is a complex system made up of many different types of neurons that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. The behavior of these neurons can be described using mathematical models, which are useful for understanding how the brain processes information. However, these models often do not accurately describe the behavior of small networks of neurons, which are important for understanding how information is processed in the brain. In this article, we develop a new mathematical model that can accurately describe the behavior of small networks of neurons. We use this model to study how the behavior of these networks changes as the strength of inhibition between neurons changes. We find that when inhibition is strong, the behavior of the network becomes much more complex, with multiple different solutions to the mathematical model emerging. This complexity is not captured by the mean-field approximation, which is a simpler mathematical model that is often used to study the behavior of large networks of neurons. Our new model provides a more accurate description of the behavior of small networks of neurons, and it may be useful for understanding how information is processed in the brain.
7SLRNA is a gene found in Leishmania parasites that is involved in protein translocation. It is abundant in the cytoplasm and has a short half-life, making it a good target for detecting live parasites. In this study, the authors used 7SLRNA to detect live Leishmania parasites in the blood, skin, and tonsils of patients with dermal leishmaniasis. They found that 7SLRNA genes and transcripts were present in all of the samples they tested, indicating that viable parasites are present in these tissues. This study provides important information for understanding the natural history of human infection with Leishmania parasites and for developing new control measures.
 DNA replication is a fundamental process that occurs in all living organisms. In eukaryotes, DNA replication is regulated in time and space, and each genomic region shows reproducible replication timing in S-phase. Recent work has shown that DNA replication timing is regulated by chromatin features, such as histone modifications and chromatin binding proteins. In this study, the authors used quantitative statistical models to investigate the combinatorial potential of chromatin features for the prediction of DNA replication timing in Drosophila. They found that while combinations of chromatin binding proteins exhibit moderate predictive power for replication timing, pairwise interactions between histone modifications lead to accurate predictions genome-wide. The authors also identified a simplified, biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication timing, which reached 80% of the full model accuracy using six model terms. Finally, they showed that pairwise combinations of histone modifications are able to predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types. Overall, the study provides support to the existence of combinatorial histone modification patterns for DNA replication and reveals cell-type independent key elements thereof, whose experimental investigation might contribute to elucidate the regulatory mode of this fundamental cellular process.
 Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a major public health concern, infecting 390 million people annually and causing 25,000 deaths. The virus has four serotypes ( DENV-1 to DENV-4 ) and is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. In this study, the authors used a statistical framework to analyze complete genome sequences of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 in Brazil. They found that new lineages were most likely to be imported from the Caribbean region to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil and then to disperse at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. Joint statistical analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data indicates that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, determine dengue virus spread in Brazil.
 The weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus uses its electrosensory system to detect objects in its environment. The system is composed of a network of electroreceptors that project to the medullary electrosensory lateral line lobe ( ELL ), where the information is processed. The ELL is divided into three parallel and somatotopically organized sensory maps: the lateral, centro-lateral, and centro-medial segments ( LS , CLS & CMS ). Pyramidal neurons in each map have an antagonistic center-surround receptive field ( RF ) organization, meaning that they respond more strongly to stimuli in the center of their RF than in the surrounding area. However, the size and amount of overlap of the RFs vary across the three segments. In this study, the authors used a mathematical model to investigate how differences in RF organization across the three segments affect correlations between the activities of pyramidal neurons. They found that, contrary to their predictions, correlations were not significantly different between the three segments on average. The authors then incorporated the effects of RF surround into their model and found that different combinations of RF center-surround relative gain and size could give rise to similar levels of correlations. They also found that including previously published experimental data on differences between the RF center-surround organization across the three segments gave rise to similar average levels of correlations. The authors conclude that the similar levels of correlations observed experimentally arise because cells receive similar relative levels of positively and negatively correlated inputs, despite very different RF center-surround organizations.
 Neural populations typically show correlated variability over repeat presentation of the same stimulus, known as noise correlations. These correlations can either improve or diminish the population's ability to encode information, depending on the specific details of the signal and noise correlations. In this study, we investigate how coding performance varies as a function of noise correlations, with all other aspects of the problem held fixed. We prove a sign rule that states that if noise and signal correlations have opposite signs for all cell pairs, then coding performance will improve compared to the independent case. We also show that a diverse set of correlation structures can improve coding, and that the optimal correlation structures must lie on boundaries of the possible set of noise correlations. Finally, we provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the coding performance in the presence of noise will be as good as it would be if there were no noise present at all. Our results provide unifying insights into the role of noise correlations in population coding and have implications for understanding how neural populations encode information.
 Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are two common pathogens that often co-infect burn wounds and cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility in a strain-dependent manner. We identified three independent interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus: LasA endopeptidase, rhamnolipids, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). These findings suggest that the presence of P. aeruginosa can significantly alter the outcome of S. aureus antibiotic treatment. This work highlights the importance of considering the microbial context of the infection environment during the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection is a major public health problem worldwide, with an estimated 390 million cases per year . Thrombocytopenia, or a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, is a common complication of DENV infection and can lead to severe bleeding and plasma leakage . The mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in DENV infection are multifactorial, including increased platelet clearance . Two well-known mechanisms of platelet clearance are increased binding of von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) to platelets and loss of sialic acids from the platelet membrane . In two observational cohort studies in Bandung and Jepara, Indonesia, we found that adult patients with DENV infection had higher plasma concentrations of VWF antigen and active VWF, as well as reduced surface sialic acid on platelets . We also found that VWF binding to platelets resulted in platelet desialylation, which can be inhibited by the sialidase inhibitor oseltamivir. Our data suggest that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in DENV infection results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance, and that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in DENV infection.
 Bidirectional gene pairs are defined as two genes arranged head-to-head ( adjacent 5′ ends ) on opposite strands of DNA and within 1 , 000 bp of one another . The intervening regulatory region is called a “bidirectional promoter” . These promoters influence expression of both adjacent genes and are often associated with genes that function in DNA repair, with the potential to participate in the development of cancer . Using the database of spliced-expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) , we identified the most complete collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters. A rigorous screen of the spliced EST data identified new bidirectional promoters, many of which functioned as alternative promoters or regulated novel transcripts. Additionally, we show a highly significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including a substantial number of genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers. The repeated use of this promoter structure in the human genome suggests it could regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes. Using microarray expression data from 79 human tissues, we verify regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. Subsets of these promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. Interpreting the regulation of genes involved in co-expression networks, especially those involved in cancer, will be an important step toward defining molecular events that may contribute to disease.
 We have analyzed the karyotypes of 37 fly species from 22 different families of Diptera and discovered tremendous hidden diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes among flies . We identified over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations, and the small dot chromosome is repeatedly used as the sex chromosome, which presumably reflects the ancestral karyotype of higher Diptera. However, we identified species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others in which a different chromosome replaced the dot as a sex chromosome or in which up to three chromosomal elements became incorporated into the sex chromosomes, and others yet with female heterogamety (ZW sex chromosomes). Transcriptome analysis shows that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times in flies, consistently through up-regulation of the single X in males. However, X chromosomes generally show a deficiency of genes with male-biased expression, possibly reflecting sex-specific selective pressures. These species thus provide a rich resource to study sex chromosome biology in a comparative manner and show that similar selective forces have shaped the unique evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa.
 Zika virus ( ZIKV ) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that has been linked to severe fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly, in babies born to infected mothers. In this study, we investigated archived blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 mothers who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012. We tested maternal blood for the presence of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies using commercially available human ZIKV IgM and IgG ELISA kits. One mother who delivered babies with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody (16.6%), and three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody (50%). ZIKV showed a trend toward significance with microcephaly. Similarly, ZIKV IgG antibody positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than mothers who were negative for ZIKV IgG antibodies (Odds ratio [OR] = 11.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8–147.9, p = 0.083). These data provide further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and suggest the presence of ZIKV positive cases and associated microcephaly in the United States as early as 2009.
 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a necrotizing skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans ( MU ) infection. The mode of transmission of MU to humans is still not clear, although it is believed to be associated with slow-moving water bodies. In this study, we aimed to source-track MU infections to specific water bodies by matching VNTR profiles of MU in human samples to those in the environment. We collected environmental samples from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in Ghana and genotyped them using four VNTR loci in the MU Agy99 genome. We also genotyped 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies. We also present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. Our study provides insights into the transmission of MU and highlights the importance of a OneHealth approach in controlling the spread of infectious diseases.
 The study analyzed an extensive new database of alien birds to explore what determines the global distribution of alien species richness for an entire taxonomic class. The authors found that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven largely by European (mainly British) colonialism. However, recent introductions are a wider phenomenon, involving more species and countries, and driven in part by increasing economic activity. The authors found that, globally, alien bird species richness is currently highest at midlatitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic effects, most notably the number of species introduced (i.e., colonisation pressure). Nevertheless, environmental drivers are also important, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated. The authors demonstrated that colonisation pressure is key to understanding alien species richness, showed that areas of high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale, and emphasized the likely ongoing threats to global environments from introductions of species.
 Upstream Binding Factor ( UBF ) is a multi-HMGB-box protein that was first identified as a co-factor in RNA polymerase I ( RPI/PolI ) transcription . However, its poor DNA sequence selectivity and its ability to generate nucleosome-like nucleoprotein complexes suggest a more generalized role in chromatin structure . We previously showed that extensive depletion of UBF reduced the number of actively transcribed ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes , but had little effect on rRNA synthesis rates or cell proliferation , leaving open the question of its requirement for RPI transcription . Using gene deletion in mouse , we now show that UBF is essential for embryo development beyond morula . Conditional deletion in cell cultures reveals that UBF is also essential for transcription of the rRNA genes and that it defines the active chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences . Loss of UBF prevents formation of the SL1/TIF1B pre-initiation complex and recruitment of the RPI-Rrn3/TIF1A complex . It is also accompanied by recruitment of H3K9me3 , canonical histone H1 and HP1α , but not by de novo DNA methylation . Further , genes retain penta-acetyl H4 and H2A . Z , suggesting that even in the absence of UBF the rRNA genes can maintain a potentially active state . In contrast to canonical histone H1 , binding of H1 . 4 is dependent on UBF , strongly suggesting that it plays a positive role in gene activity . Unexpectedly , arrest of rRNA synthesis does not suppress transcription of the 5S , tRNA or snRNA genes , nor expression of the several hundred mRNA genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis . Thus , rRNA gene activity does not coordinate global gene expression for ribosome biogenesis . Loss of UBF also unexpectedly induced the formation in cells of a large sub-nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body ( NPB ) of oocytes and early embryos . These somatic NPBs contain rRNA synthesis and processing factors but do not associate with the rRNA gene loci ( NORs ) .
 We have tested the idea that the long-range action of Wingless (Wg) is dispensable for tissue patterning by examining its role in the adult Drosophila intestine. We find that Wg is required for proper development of the adult gut, including regulation of target gene activation, compartment boundary formation, stem cell proliferation and epithelial fate specification, bundling, striation, pathfinding of visceral muscle fibers, communication between epithelium and muscle, gut folding, crosstalk with the Dpp signal transduction pathway, and organismal viability and fitness. Our findings call for reassessment of the requirement for the direct, long-range action of Wg in tissue patterning.
 Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A key process in invasive GAS disease is the ability to accumulate plasmin at the cell surface. The role of host activators of plasminogen in this process is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) contributes to plasmin recruitment and subsequent invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase (Ska) was required to facilitate cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of Ska, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS strain 5448 during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. Furthermore, GAS were able to mediate a significant increase in the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma. In order to assess the contribution of uPA to invasive GAS disease, a previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection was employed. Both C57/black 6J and AlbPLG1 mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene were significantly more susceptible to invasive GAS disease than uPA−/− mice. The observed decrease in virulence in uPA−/−mice was found to correlate directly with a decrease in bacterial dissemination and reduced cell surface plasmin accumulation by GAS. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
 Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that colonizes the human stomach and is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. The cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) is a region of the H. pylori genome that encodes components of a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. In this study, the authors used mass spectrometry to identify co-purifying proteins of CagA and found that CagL, CagI, and CagH are all components of the cag T4SS. These proteins are required for CagA translocation and IL-8 induction, and they are not homologous to components of T4SSs in other bacterial species. The authors also found that these proteins are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that ΔcagI and ΔcagL mutant strains fail to form pili, whereas a ΔcagH mutant strain exhibits a hyperpiliated phenotype. The authors suggest that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis.
 Bovine tuberculosis ( bTB ) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis . Vaccination of cattle might offer a long-term solution for controlling the disease and priority has been given to the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB . We hypothesized that by studying global gene expression we could identify in vitro predictors of protection that could help to facilitate vaccine development . Calves were vaccinated with BCG or with a heterologous BCG prime adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol . Protective efficacy was determined after M . bovis challenge . RNA was prepared from PPD-stimulated PBMC prepared from vaccinated-protected , vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle prior to M . bovis challenge and global gene expression determined by RNA-seq . 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared with vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle . Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant pathway related to this dataset with IL-22 expression identified as the dominant surrogate of protection besides INF-γ . Finally , the expression of these candidate genes identified by RNA-seq was evaluated by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated calves . This experiment confirmed the importance of IL-22 as predictor of vaccine efficacy .
γ-TuRC is a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) that is essential for the organization of microtubules in most eukaryotic cells. In this study, the authors optimized a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of γ-TuRC and AIR-1 at the apical ncMTOC in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. They found that GIP-1, a core γ-TuRC component, is required to recruit other γ-TuRC components to the apical ncMTOC, including MZT-1/MZT1, which is characterized here for the first time in animal development. In contrast, AIR-1 and MZT-1 were specifically required to recruit γ-TuRC to the centrosome, but not to the apical ncMTOC. Surprisingly, microtubules remained robustly organized at the apical ncMTOC upon γ-TuRC and AIR-1 co-depletion, and upon depletion of other known microtubule regulators, including TPXL-1/TPX2, ZYG-9/ch-TOG, PTRN-1/CAMSAP, and NOCA-1/Ninein. The authors suggest that different MTOCs use discrete proteins for their function and that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources.
 We compared 11 different approaches to phase human genomes using the publicly available ‘Genome-In-A-Bottle’ ( GIAB ) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard. The phasing strategies we compared included laboratory-based assays that prepare DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing as well as purely computational approaches that seek to reconstruct phase information from general sequencing reads and constructs or population-level haplotype frequency information obtained through a reference panel of haplotypes. To assess the performance of the 11 approaches, we used metrics that included, among others, switch error rates, haplotype block lengths, the proportion of fully phase-resolved genes, phasing accuracy and yield between pairs of SNVs. Our comparisons suggest that a hybrid or combined approach that leverages: 1 . population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite , 2 . either genome-wide sequencing read data or parental genotypes , and 3 . a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies , provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. We found that for population-based approaches, phasing performance is enhanced with the addition of genome-wide read data; e.g., whole genome shotgun and/or RNA sequencing reads. Further, we found that the inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide as much as a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. Finally, we also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with the genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which included regions of low polymorphism or SNV density.
 The flagellar type-III secretion system ( fT3SS ) is responsible for the export of building blocks of the flagellum and virulence effectors from the cytoplasm into host cells. The fT3SS utilizes both the energy of the proton motive force ( PMF ) and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation. We report that flagellar type-III secretion can occur in the absence of ATPase activity by mutations that increased the PMF and flagellar substrate levels. We also show that increased PMF bypassed the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 virulence-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. Our data suggest that ATPase activity is dispensable in the type-III protein export process.
 Bistability is a common feature of many gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) that control essential biological functions such as cell differentiation and cell cycle regulation. However, identifying the network topologies that can exhibit bistability is a challenge due to the large variety of GRNs that exist for even a small number of components. We employed chemical reaction network theory ( CRNT ) in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity for bistability of more than 40,000 simple GRNs that can be formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. We found that there exist reaction rate constants leading to bistability in ∼90% of these GRN models, including several circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems. Our results suggest that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. We integrated publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion. Our results demonstrate the power of parameter-free modeling in simplifying the study of complex regulatory networks, understanding network evolution, and designing new synthetic biological circuits.
 Orofacial clefts are a common birth defect that can affect the lip, palate, or both. The causes of orofacial clefts are not fully understood, but genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role. In this study, researchers identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene as a cause of orofacial clefting in humans and mice. HYAL2 encodes an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. The researchers found that the gene mutations destabilize the molecule, reducing HYAL2 protein levels. Consistent with the clinical presentation in affected individuals, investigations of Hyal2-/- mice revealed craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate. In addition, cor triatriatum sinister and hearing loss, identified in a proportion of Hyal2-/- mice, were also found as incompletely penetrant features in affected humans. The researchers conclude that HYAL2 and hyaluronan turnover are important for normal human and mouse development.
 The inner ear of mammals is responsible for hearing and balance. The hair cells in the inner ear are connected by tip links, which are essential for the hair cells to detect sound. The tip links are made up of two proteins, PCDH15 and CDH23. When the tip links are damaged, the hair cells lose their ability to detect sound. However, the hair cells can regenerate new tip links and regain their ability to detect sound. In this study, the authors used a new technique to visualize the tip links and the proteins that make them up. They found that the new tip links that form first during regeneration are made up of only PCDH15, not the usual combination of PCDH15 and CDH23. These new tip links are able to detect sound, but they do not adapt properly. Later, the usual combination of PCDH15 and CDH23 forms and the tip links adapt properly. This study provides new insights into how the hair cells regenerate their tip links and how the new tip links are able to detect sound.
 Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a major public health concern, causing an estimated 100 million symptomatic infections each year . DENV can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild dengue fever ( DF ) to more severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) . The mechanisms that trigger transition from DF to DHF are not well understood. In this study, we performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DHF patients at the critical and recovery phases of infection. We identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF at the critical phase, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were observed up to 5 fold higher levels among DHF compared to DF patients and were significantly correlated to the higher levels of aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and alanine transaminase ( ALT ), suggestive of liver injury among DHF. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in the blood, was observed to be 1.5 fold lower among DHF compared to DF patients. This could result in decreased capacity of endogenous antioxidant defense and elevated oxidative stress among DHF patients. In the recovery phase, the levels of eight metabolites were still significantly higher or lower among DHF patients, including chenodeoxyglycocholic acid, one of the bile acids observed at the critical phase. This indicates potential prolonged adverse impact on the liver due to DENV infection in DHF patients. Our study identified altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF pathogenesis and provided insights into the different host and DENV interactions between DF and DHF. The results advance our understanding on the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis, alluding to possible novel therapeutic targets to dengue management.
 The metabolic pathway of purine nucleotides in parasitic protozoa is a potent drug target for treatment of parasitemia . Guanosine 5’-monophosphate reductase ( GMPR ) , which catalyzes the deamination of guanosine 5’-monophosphate ( GMP ) to inosine 5’-monophosphate ( IMP ) , plays an important role in the interconversion of purine nucleotides to maintain the intracellular balance of their concentration . However , only a few studies on protozoan GMPR have been reported at present . In this study , we identified the GMPR in Trypanosoma brucei , a causative protozoan parasite of African trypanosomiasis , and found that the GMPR proteins were consistently localized to glycosomes in T . brucei bloodstream forms . We characterized its recombinant protein to investigate the enzymatic differences between GMPRs of T . brucei and its host animals . T . brucei GMPR was distinct in having an insertion of a tandem repeat of the cystathionine β-synthase ( CBS ) domain , which was absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs . The recombinant protein of T . brucei GMPR catalyzed the conversion of GMP to IMP in the presence of NADPH , and showed apparent affinities for both GMP and NADPH different from those of its mammalian counterparts . Interestingly , the addition of monovalent cations such as K+ and NH4+ to the enzymatic reaction increased the GMPR activity of T . brucei , whereas none of the mammalian GMPR’s was affected by these cations . The monophosphate form of the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibited T . brucei GMPR activity , though mammalian GMPRs showed no or only a little inhibition by it . These results suggest that the mechanism of the GMPR reaction in T . brucei is distinct from that in the host organisms . Finally , we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner , suggesting the availability of ribavirin to develop a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis .
 The study of how drugs interact with proteins is crucial for understanding their mechanism of action and for developing new drugs. In this study, the authors used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how two drugs, benzocaine and phenytoin, interact with the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb. They found that both drugs bind to two likely sites in the pore, one just above the activation gate and one at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations. The authors also found that both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with only small energy barriers, suggesting that this can represent the long-posited hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanism of action of these drugs and can help in the development of new drugs that target specific subtypes of sodium channels.
 The study investigates the role of MyD88-mediated signaling in the immune response to intestinal infection with Citrobacter rodentium. The authors used a novel murine knock-in model for MyD88 that enables the cell type-specific reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in otherwise MyD88-deficient mice. They found that functional MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) was sufficient to activate dendritic cells (DC) and to induce the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) response as well as the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to infection with C. rodentium. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to several other cell types, including macrophages (MO), T cells or ILC3 did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses upon infection. However, the functional expression of MyD88 in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) also partially protected the mice during intestinal infection, which was associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide RegIIIγ and the acute phase protein SAA1 by epithelial cells. Together, the data suggest that MyD88 signaling in DC and IEC is both essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses upon intestinal infection with C. rodentium.
 Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus . The disease is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual ivermectin mass drug administration ( MDA ) . An immunodiagnostic test based on the detection of human IgG4 antibodies in the blood to the Onchocerca volvulus-specific antigen Ov16 is one of the recommended tools for determining whether transmission is interrupted and mass treatment can stop . The ONCHOSIM model was extended with new output on the Ov16 antibody serostatus of individuals . Seroconversion was assumed to be triggered by the first worm establishing in the host , with seroconversion occurring either before maturation , after maturation or only after the start of mf production . We are mainly interested in seroconversion rates in children , and for now ignore the possibility of seroreversion to simplify the model . Yearly repeated MDA leads to a strong reduction in the parasite acquisition rate in humans . This reduces the seroconversion rate in newborns and young children , while those who seroconverted before the start of control remain antibody positive . Both the microfiladermia prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and the Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA . The association between either of these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was not influenced much by the assumed treatment coverage levels , but was found to depend on baseline endemicity levels , assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion , and diagnostic test characteristics ( sensitivity and specificity ) . Better understanding of the dynamics of Ov16 antibody responses is required for accurate interpretation of seroprevalence data and more precise estimation of endpoint for MDA . Our study demonstrates that this endpoint will be dependent on baseline endemicity levels , which should be taken into account in guidelines for defining when to stop MDA .
22L prions, which are naturally swainsonine resistant, were propagated in PK1 cells in the presence of swainsonine. Interestingly, this led to the emergence of swainsonine-sensitive variants. However, when these swainsonine-sensitive variants were propagated in the presence of swainsonine, they reverted back to swainsonine resistance. This suggests that prions can adapt to their environment and that these adaptations can be stable. The misfolded prion protein associated with swainsonine-dependent variants was less rapidly cleared in PK1 cells than that associated with swainsonine-sensitive variants, indicating that likely structural differences of the misfolded prion protein underlie the properties of the prions.
 Metabolism is a fundamental system that sustains life by extracting energy from external sources. In this study, we analyzed the potential for innovation in metabolism by mapping all possible metabolic genotypes and their associated phenotypes. We found that metabolic genotype space is vast, with over 1015 possible metabolisms. Using flux balance analysis, we predicted the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. We found that viable metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that extends far or all the way through metabolic genotype space. This suggests that metabolic innovation is possible through a small number of genotypic changes. We also found that the minimal distance of genotype networks associated with different phenotypes is small, such that one can reach metabolisms with novel phenotypes through one or few genotypic changes. These findings suggest that metabolic evolution is constrained by the structure of metabolic genotype space, but also has the potential for innovation.
 The population genetics of Triatoma dimidiata haplogroups were analyzed at landscape and sub-regional scales in Chiapas and regional level across the Mexican Neotropics . Two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene were analyzed due to bias from differential haplogroup specificity using a previously designed sequence. At both landscape ( anthropic modification gradient ) and regional ( demographic , fragmentation , biogeographic , climate ) scales , lowest T . dimidiata genetic diversity occurs where there is greatest historical anthropic modification , and where T . cruzi infection prevalence is significantly highest. Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence was significantly higher than expected in haplogroups 1 and 3 , while lower than expected in haplogroup 2 . There was also a significant difference of DTUI and DTUVI infection frequencies in both haplogroups 1 and 3 , while no difference of either in haplogroup 2 . All haplogroups from the Mexican Neotropics had moderate to high haplotype diversity , while greatest genetic differentiation was between haplogroups 1 and 3 ( above FST = 0 . 868 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Divergence of the complex from the MRCA was estimated between 0 . 97 MYA ( 95% HPD interval = 0 . 55–1 . 53 MYA ) and 0 . 85 MYA ( 95% HPD interval = 0 . 42–1 . 5 MYA ) for ND4A and both concatenated fragments , respectively , with primary divergence from the MRCA of haplogroups 2 and 3 ( above FST = 0 . 868 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Effective population size for Mexican haplogroups 1 and 2 increased between 0 . 02 and 0 . 03 MYA . This study supports previous ecological niche evidence for the complex´s origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus , and provides evidence for recent divergence of three primary dimidiata haplogroups , with differential T . cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity , important components of vector capacity .
 Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS ) is a rodent-borne disease caused by two hantaviruses in China: Hantaan virus and Seoul virus . Environmental factors can significantly affect the risk of contracting hantavirus infections . We aimed to clarify the environmental risk factors favoring rodent-to-human transmission to provide scientific evidence for developing effective HFRS prevention and control strategies . The 10-year ( 2006–2015 ) field surveillance data from the rodent hosts for hantavirus , the epidemiological and environmental data extracted from satellite images and meteorological stations , rodent-to-human transmission rates and impacts of the environment on rodent community composition were used to quantify the relationships among environmental factors , rodent species and HFRS occurrence . Rodent species in Chenzhou , a hantavirus hotspot , comprise mainly Rattus norvegicus , Mus musculus , R . flavipectus and some other species ( R . losea and Microtus fortis calamorum ) . The rodent species played different roles across the various land types we examined , but all of them were associated with transmission risks . Some species were associated with HFRS occurrence risk in forest and water bodies . R . norvegicus and R . flavipectus were associated with risk of HFRS incidence in grassland , whereas M . musculus and R . flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land . The rodent community composition was also associated with environmental variability . The predictive risk models based on these significant factors were validated by a good-fit model , where: cultivated land was predicted to represent the highest risk for HFRS incidence , which accords with the statistics for HFRS cases in 2014–2015 . The spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease may be influenced by rodent community composition , which is associated with local environmental conditions . Therefore , future work should focus on preventing HFRS is moist , warm environments .
 Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by activating mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene. The most common mutation in CS is c . 34G>A (p . Gly12Ser), but a rare mutation c . 35G>T (p . Gly12Val) has been associated with severe, early lethal CS. We identified a new germline p . Gly12Val mutation in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of his HRAS cDNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild type and mutant HRAS minigenes, we confirmed that c . 35_36GC>TG results in exon 2 skipping by simultaneously disrupting the function of a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and creation of an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS). We show that this vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 is caused by a weak 3’ splice site, which makes exon 2 inclusion dependent on binding of splicing stimulatory proteins like SRSF2 to the critical ESE. Because the majority of cancer- and CS- causing mutations are located here, they affect splicing differently. Therefore, our results also demonstrate that the phenotype in CS and somatic cancers is not only determined by the different transforming potentials of mutant HRAS proteins, but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion resulting from the different HRAS mutations. Finally, we show that a splice switching oligonucleotide (SSO) that blocks access to the critical ESE causes exon 2 skipping and halts proliferation of cancer cells. This unravels a potential for development of new anti-cancer therapies based on SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping.
6-methyladenosine ( m6A ) is a common modification on mRNAs that plays important roles in various biological processes . Inactivation of Mettl3, a key factor in m6A formation, in the developing mouse brain causes severe developmental defects in the cerebellum . Loss of m6A leads to extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing events, which consequently induce premature CGC death and impaired cerebellar development . Our findings reveal a critical role of METTL3-mediated m6A in regulating the development of the mammalian cerebellum.
 Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and are capable of differentiating into any cell type of the developing embryo. The transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are essential for maintaining the pluripotent state of ES cells. In this study, the authors show that combinatorial binding of these transcription factors is strongly associated with co-localization of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. They also observe that the same loci bound by Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. The authors compare mouse and human ES cells and find that less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are shared between species. In contrast, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and even between 53% and 63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved. The authors suggest that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role for embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. Their data suggests that the fast evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding events, whereas "gene regulatory hotspots" which are bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout early development are under stronger evolutionary constraints.
 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood cells. AML is caused by genetic mutations that lead to the production of abnormal proteins. One of these abnormal proteins is AML1/ETO, which is produced when two genes, AML1 and ETO, fuse together. AML1/ETO is responsible for the development of AML. In this study, researchers used a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling to identify the genes that are regulated by AML1/ETO. They found that AML1/ETO and AML1, the wild-type version of the gene, bind to the same regions of DNA. However, AML1/ETO also binds to regions of DNA that are not bound by AML1. The researchers also found that AML1/ETO binds to regions of DNA that are bound by a protein called HEB. HEB is a protein that is involved in the development of blood cells. The researchers found that AML1/ETO and HEB bind to the same regions of DNA. The study provides important information about how AML1/ETO regulates gene expression and how it is related to the wild-type version of the gene, AML1. This information could help researchers develop new treatments for AML.
 In this study, we investigated the role of the Leishmania donovani histone acetyltransferase HAT2 in regulating gene expression. We found that HAT2 is essential for the parasite's survival and that it acetylates histone H4K10 in vitro and in vivo. We also found that HAT2-depleted cells displayed growth and cell cycle defects, and poor survival in host cells. Real time PCR and DNA microarray analyses, as well as rescue experiments, revealed that downregulation of cyclins CYC4 and CYC9 were responsible for S phase and G2/M defects of HAT2-depleted cells respectively. We also found that CYC4 and CYC9 have their own specific promoters, at least some of which are activated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. This report presents the first data pointing to cell cycle-specific activation of promoters in trypanosomatids, thus uncovering new facets of gene regulation in this parasite family.
 In this study, we used computational modeling to investigate the underlying mechanisms of inferring others' intentions during social interactions. We designed an interactive economic game in which 16 pairs of volunteers interacted with each other. The player performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task and received information about a binary lottery from a visual pie chart. The adviser, who received more predictive information, issued an additional recommendation. Critically, the game was structured such that the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied in time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, we found that the players' behavior was best explained by the deployment of hierarchical learning: they inferred on the volatility of the advisers' intentions in order to optimize their predictions about the validity of their advice. Beyond learning, volatility estimates also affected the trial-by-trial variability of decisions: participants were more likely to rely on their estimates of advice accuracy for making choices when they believed that the adviser's intentions were presently stable. Finally, our model of the players' inference predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index ( IRI ) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness, and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. Overall, our results suggest that humans ( i ) employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others, ( ii ) use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and ( iii ) integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework presented here can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts and may prove useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition.
 Scrub typhus is a mite-borne infectious disease that is endemic in Asia. It has been a rural disease, but indigenous urban cases have been observed in Seoul, South Korea. Urban scrub typhus may have a significant impact because of the large population. Indigenous urban scrub typhus was epidemiologically identified in Seoul, the largest metropolitan city in South Korea, using national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013. For detailed analysis of clinical features, patients from one hospital that reported the majority of cases were selected and compared to a historic control group. Chigger mites were prospectively collected in the city using a direct chigger mite-collecting trap, and identified using both phenotypic and 18S rDNA sequencing analyses. Their infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi was confirmed by sequencing the 56-kDa antigen gene. Eighty-eight cases of urban scrub typhus were determined in Seoul. The possible sites of infection were mountainous areas (56.8%), city parks (20.5%), the vicinity of one’s own residence (17.0%), and riversides (5.7%). Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gwanak mountain, one of the suspected infection sites in southern Seoul, and seventy-six (87.4%) of them were identified as Helenicula miyagawai and eight (9.2%) as Leptotrombidium scutellare. Pooled DNA extracted from H. miyagawai mites yielded O. tsutsugamushi Boryong strain. Twenty-six patients from one hospital showed low APACHE II score (3.4 ± 2.7), low complication rate (3.8%), and no hypokalemia. We identified the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul, and a subgroup of them had mild clinical features. The chigger mite H. miyagawai infected with O. tsutsugamushi within the city was found. In endemic area, urban scrub typhus needs to be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases and a target for prevention.
26G and 21U RNAs are small RNA molecules that play a role in RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans. These RNAs are bound by specific Argonaute (Ago) proteins and are involved in the regulation of gene expression. The stability of these RNAs is regulated by the enzyme HEN1, which methylates the 3′ end of the RNA. The authors of this study have studied the effects of HEN1 on the different RNAi pathways in C. elegans. They found that HEN1 has differential effects on the 26G and 21U RNA pathways. In the germline, the stability of 21U RNAs is only mildly affected by the loss of HEN1, while most 26G RNAs display reduced stability and respond to the loss of HENN-1 by displaying increased 3′-uridylation frequencies. The authors also found that HENN-1 specifically modifies ERGO-1–bound 26G RNAs, while ALG-3/ALG-4–bound 26G RNAs are not modified. Global gene expression analysis of henn-1 mutants revealed mild effects, including down-regulation of many germline-expressed genes. The authors suggest that the effects on global gene expression are indirect and that HENN-1 likely plays a role in the stability of 26G RNAs.
Glycosylation is a process that adds sugars to proteins, and it is important for many biological processes. However, the genetic regulation of glycosylation is not well understood. In this study, researchers used genome-wide association and high-throughput glycomics analysis to identify common variants in three population cohorts that affect N-glycan levels in human plasma. They found that variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α ( HNF1α ) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 influence N-glycan levels. They also found that HNF1α regulates the expression of key fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. These findings suggest that HNF1α is a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process. This mechanism has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders.
 Centromeres are the regions of chromosomes that attach to the spindle during cell division. In many organisms, including plants, centromeres are marked by specific DNA sequences that are not essential for the function of the centromere. In maize, centromeres are marked by repeats of the DNA sequence 350 bp in length. These repeats are not necessary for the function of the centromere, but they are important for the localization of the inner kinetochore protein CENPC. CENPC is a protein that binds to DNA and is required for the proper localization of the kinetochore. In this study, the authors used genetic and biochemical techniques to study the DNA-binding region of CENPC in maize. They found that CENPC has a DNA-binding region that is localized to a 122 amino acid region of the protein. They also found that RNA is important for the proper localization of CENPC. The authors propose that RNA helps to recruit CENPC to the centromere by altering its DNA-binding characteristics.
 We have used genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) to identify genetic variants associated with birth weight ( BW ), childhood obesity ( CO ), and childhood body mass index ( CBMI ). We then used eQTL analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the placenta in response to these genetic variants. We found that placental eQTLs are significantly enriched for GWAS loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI. We also found that eight, six, and one transcripts colocalized with BW, CO, and CBMI risk loci, respectively. Our study suggests that placental transcription in utero plays a key role in determining postnatal body size and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity.
 The study aimed to determine the prevalence of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in an endemic area of Malda district, West Bengal, India, and to compare three diagnostic tools for PKDL case detection. The prevalence of PKDL was determined by active surveillance and confirmed by PCR-based diagnosis. Patients were treated with either sodium stibogluconate or oral miltefosine and followed up for two years to observe lesion regression. PCR-based method was found to be highly sensitive for case confirmation. In majority of the cases, skin lesions persisted after treatment completion which gradually disappeared during 6–12 months post treatment period. The study highlights the importance of active mass surveys to detect PKDL cases and the need for a well-designed study with higher number of samples to establish when/whether PKDL patients are free from parasite after treatment. The PCR-based method is helpful in confirming diagnosis of PKDL and can be used in a referral laboratory at district or state level to achieve the goal of eliminating kala-azar.
 The pneumococcus is a bacterium that causes pneumonia and other infections. It has a unique genetic system that allows it to take up DNA from its environment and incorporate it into its own genome. This process, called transformation, is controlled by a set of genes that are turned on and off in a specific order. The genes are turned on in response to a chemical signal called competence stimulating peptide (CSP), which is produced by the bacteria themselves. The genes are turned off when another chemical signal, called fratricide, is produced. The timing of when the genes are turned on and off is important for the transformation process to work properly. In this study, the authors looked at how the genes are turned on and off in different strains of the pneumococcus. They found that the timing of when the genes are turned on and off is different in different strains, and that this difference is important for the transformation process to work properly. The authors also found that the CSP signal is important for turning on the genes, but that it is not the only signal that is important. Overall, the study provides important insights into how the pneumococcus controls its genetic system.
 Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause cervical cancer. HPV16 is the most common high-risk HPV type and is responsible for over 60% of cervical cancer cases. The HPV16 capsid is composed of 72 pentamers of the major capsid protein L1 and approximately 20–40 copies of the minor capsid protein L2. L2 plays important roles in capsid assembly and genome encapsidation, and is essential for establishing infection within the cell. The current study investigates the translocation of L2 from the trans-Golgi network ( TGN ) to the nucleus, which is a critical step in HPV infection. The authors developed a novel assay to monitor L2 translocation based on the compartmentalization of a specific BirA enzyme-substrate reaction. They found that inhibition of cellular processes and factors that are essential for L2/vDNA trafficking to the TGN, including furin, endosome acidification, cyclophilins, and γ-secretase, potently block L2 translocation. Furthermore, the authors found that mitotic entry is sufficient for L2 translocation to occur and that translocation coincides with mitosis in synchronized cells. Finally, they propose a model whereby chromatin binding of L2 in prometaphase is a necessary prerequisite for translocation of L2/vDNA across limiting membranes. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of HPV infection and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HPV-related diseases.
 We present a method to measure the relative transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. This is important in understanding the dynamics of influenza outbreaks and the potential impact of interventions such as NAI distribution. We use data from ferret transmission studies to demonstrate the framework's behaviour and suggest how to optimise experimental design for assessment of transmissibility. The method introduced here has applicability beyond influenza to other viral and bacterial pathogens.
 The study presented here investigates the role of the B-box protein BBX21 in the integration of light and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during seed germination and early seedling development in Arabidopsis thaliana . The authors found that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. They also showed that ABI5 binds to its own promoter and activates its expression, while BBX21 negatively regulates this activity. The authors propose that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter and that these transcriptional regulators work in concert to integrate light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana .
 The Mediator complex is an essential co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved throughout eukaryotes . Here we present the first study of Mediator in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans . We focused on the Middle domain subunit Med31 , the Head domain subunit Med20 , and Srb9/Med13 from the Kinase domain . The C . albicans Mediator shares some roles with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe , such as functions in the response to certain stresses and the role of Med31 in the expression of genes regulated by the activator Ace2 . The C . albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence , for example genes related to morphogenesis and gene families enriched in pathogens , such as the ALS adhesins . Consistently , Med31 , Med20 , and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C . albicans , filamentation , and biofilm formation; and ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med31 for development of biofilms . Furthermore , Med31 affects virulence of C . albicans in the worm infection model . We present evidence that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in the expression of the genes encoding cell wall adhesins are different between S . cerevisiae and C . albicans: they are repressors of the FLO genes in S . cerevisiae and are activators of the ALS genes in C . albicans . This suggests that Mediator subunits regulate adhesion in a distinct manner between these two distantly related fungal species .
 The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of biofilm-associated infections in humans, and its antibiotic tolerance is a major challenge in treating these infections. In this study, the authors used a novel experimental approach to identify the genetic determinants of antibiotic tolerance in P. aeruginosa biofilms and planktonic growth conditions. They found that many loci contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting only. The authors' results provide insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and planktonic antibiotic tolerance and reveal how the cellular state and multi-cellular interactions combine to impact the response to an antibiotic challenge. Their findings may help in the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections.
 The ability to identify the most appropriate mathematical model to describe a biological system is a major challenge in systems biology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in Latin America. The disease can be transmitted through infected insect bites, blood transfusions, or contaminated food. Chagas disease can be treated with benznidazole (BNZ), but the long-term efficacy of the drug is uncertain. In this study, we followed the treatment of 103 school-aged children with chronic Chagas disease in Bolivia who were treated with BNZ. We used a combination of serological and molecular tests to monitor the treatment efficacy. Our results showed that 73 of the children completed the treatment, with three interruptions due to side effects. We found that the molecular test was more sensitive than the serological test in detecting parasites in the blood. Additionally, we found that the levels of the cytokine IL-17A decreased significantly after treatment, suggesting that IL-17A could be used as a biomarker for treatment efficacy. Overall, our study provides valuable information for the development of more effective treatment strategies for Chagas disease.
 Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes bacterial meningitis and septicemia. The bacterium has a large amount of repetitive DNA, including a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element called the Correia element (CE). The CE is a transposon that is responsible for the generation of new alleles in the meningococcus. In this study, we have analyzed the structure and function of the CE in N. meningitidis. We have identified eight different subtypes of the CE and found that some of them have much higher promoter activity than others. We have also identified a recurrent polymorphism that dictates the strength of the strongest promoter. Our results provide a resource that allows the transcriptional effects of a particular subtype at a given locus to be predicted. We have also analyzed the distribution of the CE in the population and found that no more than two-thirds of the elements maintain their subtype at any particular locus. This is due to recombinational class switching between elements in a single strain. Upon switching subtype, a new allele is available to spread through the population by natural transformation. Our study suggests that the strain-to-strain variability of the CE and the large number of strong promoters encoded by them allow for potentially widespread effects within the population as a whole.
 In filamentous fungi, development and secondary metabolism are intimately coordinated. VeA and LaeA are central regulators of these processes in Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. VeA and LaeA form a complex that regulates secondary metabolism and differentiation in response to light signals. In this study, we identified and characterized the orthologs of VeA and LaeA in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus. We found that ChLae1 and ChVel1 positively regulate T-toxin biosynthesis, pathogenicity, and super virulence, oxidative stress responses, sexual development, and aerial hyphal growth, and negatively control melanin biosynthesis and asexual differentiation. ChLAE1 OE strains are female sterile, while ChVEL1 OE strains are more fertile than WT. ChLae1 and ChVel1 repress expression of 1, 8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthesis genes, and accordingly, melanization is enhanced in Chlae1 and Chvel1 mutants, and reduced in OE strains. These observations establish ChLae1 and ChVel1 as the first factors known to regulate host selective toxin production.
 The authors used molecular dynamics simulations to study the mechanism of selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels. They found that two or three extracellular K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of NavAb in the presence of applied forces in the inward direction, but not in the outward direction. The block state occurs in an unstable local minimum of the equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscape of two K+ ions that can be ‘locked’ in place by modest applied forces. In contrast to K+, three Na+ ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a loose “knock-on” mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward directions. There is no similar local minimum in the two-dimensional free-energy landscape of two Na+ ions for a block state. The authors suggest that the inclusion of non-equilibrium factors in the simulations can provide detailed information about mechanisms of ion selectivity that is missing from mechanisms derived from either crystal structures or equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscapes.
Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a neurotropic RNA virus in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. The two main clinical forms of rabies are furious and paralytic, which occur in humans and dogs in a ratio of approximately 2:1. The furious form is characterized by limbic symptoms, while the paralytic form is characterized by lower motor neuron type paralysis. Studies have shown that there is a higher RNA viral load with less immune response in the brain in the furious form of rabies. Our previous studies in naturally infected dogs during the early disease stage showed disruption of axonal integrity in the brainstem exclusively in paralytic dogs from pronounced inflammation. We also previously demonstrated that the percentage of neuronal cell bodies containing rabies viral nucleocapsid antigen decreased in a caudal-rostral direction, which was the inverse of the level of rabies viral RNA. The present study aimed to compare intracellular viral spread (and thereby viral propagation) between paralytic and furious forms of rabies by determining the amount of rabies viral antigen beyond the neuronal cell body at different CNS levels. Our results showed that there was a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, consistent with replication occurring in the cell body region and subsequent transport out to cell processes. Greater amounts of antigen were seen in cell processes in dogs with the furious compared to paralytic form, at all anatomic levels examined. These findings suggest that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation.
 CTCF is a zinc-finger protein that plays an important role in the regulation of transcription by preventing inappropriate enhancer/promoter interaction. In Drosophila, CTCF has only been characterized recently. We carried out chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites within representative regions of the Drosophila genome. Our data indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism. Comparison of the locations of the CTCF sites with characterised Polycomb target sites and histone modification provides support for the domain model of BX-C regulation.
 We previously demonstrated that actinonin, a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of peptide deformylase (PDF), induces a conformational change in the enzyme that is essential for its inhibitory activity. Here, we provide a detailed mechanism for this induced-fit process at atomic resolution. We solved crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state, as well as several intermediate mimics captured during the process. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is finally “zipped up” by additional binding interactions. Together with biochemical analyses, these data allow a coherent reconstruction of the sequence of events leading from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme. A “movie” that reconstructs this entire process can be further extrapolated to catalysis.
 The thalamus is a key relay center for sensory information from the periphery to the cerebral cortex. While the thalamus receives input from many sensory modalities, it also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback is thought to play a role in modulating the transfer of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex. In this study, we used a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to model the impact of cortical feedback on the transfer efficiency of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex. We found that the transfer efficiency of sensory information is influenced by the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. We also found that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. These findings suggest that the cortical feedback plays a key role in modulating the transfer of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex.
6mA is a novel DNA modification found in metazoans, but its biological role is not well understood. We previously identified NMAD-1 as a 6mA DNA demethylase in C. elegans. Here, we show that nmad-1 mutants have reduced fertility due to defects in meiosis. We found that NMAD-1 regulates DNA replication and repair during meiosis by binding to topoisomerase TOP-2. These results suggest that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis.
 This study identifies a novel host cell protein, adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP), that promotes human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in multiple cell types. APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial and fibroblast cells, and its overexpression promotes HCMV infection in canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, which are refractory to HCMV infection. Reduced viral immediate early gene transcription and delayed nucleus translocation of tegument delivered pp65 were detected in APMAP-deficient cells. Biochemical studies suggest that APMAP may participate in HCMV infection through interaction with gH/gL containing glycoprotein complexes at low pH and through mediating nuclear translocation of pp65. Taken together, these results indicate that APMAP is a cellular factor that augments HCMV infection at the early stage of viral infection.
 The study investigates the role of cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback in regulating cell commitment decisions during hematopoiesis.  The results suggest that cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation by providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment.  The model provides support to both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are ultimately driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating these inherently noisy cell-fate decisions with complex, pertinent behaviors such as ligand-mediated ultrasensitivity and robust multistability.  Lastly, the model shows good agreement with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis that have been observed experimentally.
 The genus Orthobunyavirus within the family Bunyaviridae is a group of emerging viruses that pose a threat to human and animal health. Despite their medical importance, little is known about their structure, which is a prerequisite for understanding virus assembly and entry. Using electron cryo-tomography, we report the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, the prototypic member of this genus. Whilst Bunyamwera virions are pleomorphic in shape, they display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike protrudes 18 nm from the viral membrane and becomes disordered upon introduction to an acidic environment. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we derived a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike to 3-nm resolution. The glycoprotein spike consists mainly of the putative class-II fusion glycoprotein and exhibits a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein–protein contacts between neighboring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike contacts at membrane-distal regions. This trimeric assembly deviates from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a greater than anticipated repertoire of viral fusion glycoprotein oligomerization. Our study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of this group of emerging pathogens.
 Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) being more common in Asian countries. To identify genetic variants associated with PACG, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on anterior chamber depth (ACD), a key anatomical risk factor for PACG. Our study identified a sequence variant within ABCC5 (rs1401999) that was associated with an increase in risk of PACG. The association was strengthened when a sub-group of controls with open angles was included in the analysis. Our findings suggest that genetic sequence variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions may play a role in PACG risk.
 The identification of homologies between different species is fundamental to our understanding of common biological principles. In this study, the authors describe the first conserved regulatory elements, called bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores), between deuterostomes and protostomes. These elements show conservation of sequence and gene synteny, and they act as developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. Although the small number of identified Bicores suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the protostome and deuterostome clades, additional Bicores may be revealed as our understanding of cis-regulatory logic and sample of bilaterian genomes continue to grow. The discovery of these conserved regulatory elements offers a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how this logic evolves.
 Influenza virus diversity and antigenic drift have been well characterized on a global scale, but the factors that influence the virus’ rapid evolution within and between human hosts are less clear. We used next generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and to define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. We found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Contrary to what has been suggested in experimental systems, our data indicate that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales.
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites that can cause severe illness and death. The disease is more prevalent in children and older adults. The immune system declines with age, which can lead to a less effective immune response to Leishmania parasites. A previous study showed that a live-attenuated Leishmania parasite strain (LdCen-/-) induced a strong protective immune response in young mice. In this study, the authors analyzed the immune response in aged mice (18 months old) and compared it to young mice (2 months old) after infection with LdCen-/-. They found that LdCen-/- infection significantly enhanced the innate immune response in both age groups, leading to a stronger Th1-type adaptive immune response. However, the adaptive immune response was reduced in aged mice compared to young mice, which correlated with less protection in aged mice. The authors suggest that further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the reduced adaptive immune response in aged mice and to develop effective vaccines for all age groups.
 Enteroviruses ( EVs ) are a group of viruses that cause a wide range of human diseases, including respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. EVs have different biophysical properties and cause different diseases. To understand the genetic basis of these differences, we created chimeras between EV-D68 ( a respiratory EV ) and EV-D94 ( an enteric EV ). We found that the capsid proteins of EV-D68 and EV-D94 have different functions. EV-D68 capsid proteins are important for acid sensitivity and temperature adaptation, while EV-D94 capsid proteins are important for tissue tropism. We also found that EV-D68 and EV-D94 have different interactions with the host immune system. These findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of EV virulence and may help guide the development of new treatments for EV infections.
 The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 ( HSV-1 ) glycoprotein gE-gI is a transmembrane Fc receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G ( hIgG ) . gE-gI can also participate in antibody bipolar bridging ( ABB ) , a process by which the antigen-binding fragments ( Fabs ) of the IgG bind a viral antigen while the Fc binds to gE-gI . IgG Fc binds gE-gI at basic , but not acidic , pH , suggesting that IgG bound at extracellular pH by cell surface gE-gI would dissociate and be degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed . The fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI–bound IgG had been unknown: they could remain at the cell surface or be endocytosed with IgG . Here , we developed an in vitro model system for ABB and investigated the trafficking of ABB complexes using 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging of ABB complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth factor , well-characterized intracellular trafficking markers . Our data showed that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI–dependent process , resulting in lysosomal localization . These results suggest that gE-gI can mediate clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses , representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis .
 Cystic hydatid disease ( CHD ) is a serious parasitic infection caused by the larval stages of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus . The parasite's larval stages, specifically protoscoleces ( PSCs ), are the only infectious form and can interact with both definitive and intermediate hosts. In this study, we used Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis to explore the transcriptome profiles of E . granulosus PSCs and elucidate the potential functions of the excretory-secretory proteins ( ESPs ) released by the parasite. We found that many proteins were significantly enriched in development-related signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β receptor pathways and insulin pathways. This study provides valuable information on the metabolic adaptation of parasites to their hosts that can be used to aid the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control.
 Nitrate is a vital source of nitrogen for plants and fungi. In the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the transcription factor NirA regulates the expression of genes involved in nitrate assimilation. NirA is inactive in the cytosol and becomes active when it is imported into the nucleus. The import of NirA into the nucleus is regulated by the exportin KapK/CRM1. In this study, the authors found that the oxidation of a methionine residue in the nuclear export sequence of NirA is required for its nuclear import and transcriptional activity. The oxidation of this methionine is catalyzed by the flavin-containing monooxygenase FmoB. The authors also found that the replacement of this methionine with an isoleucine residue leads to partial loss of NirA activity and insensitivity to FmoB-mediated nuclear export. In contrast, the replacement of this methionine with an alanine residue transforms the protein into a permanently nuclear and active transcription factor. These findings suggest that the oxidation of this methionine regulates the subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of NirA.
 Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the propagation of action potentials in neurons and muscle cells. These channels are encoded by nine genes in mammals, which are highly similar in sequence. However, the multiplicity of these genes raises the question of why so many different mechanisms for generating an action potential are necessary. In this study, we used mathematical models to investigate how functional constraints bound and shape evolution of sodium channels. We found that the simplest theoretical constraints on action potential propagation, such as the requirement for membrane excitability and a unique resting potential, directly constrain the activation and inactivation curves of sodium channels. We compared these constraints with measurements of mammalian sodium channels reported in the literature and found that the excitability properties alone distinguish the nine sodium channels into four different groups. These groups correspond to channels expressed in nerve and muscle tissue, respectively, as well as channels with the potential for a voltage threshold substantially higher than the other channels and channels that can only produce action potentials in a narrow conductance range. Our findings suggest that these channels have evolved to perform specialized tasks.
 Influenza virus is a major cause of respiratory illness worldwide. The viral polymerase is an attractive target for antiviral drugs since it performs transcription and replication of the RNA genome. The unique cap-snatching mechanism of viral transcription can be inhibited by targeting either the PB2 cap-binding or PA endonuclease domains. Here, we describe high resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 ( pH1N1 ) PA endonuclease domain with a series of specific inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin. These results will be important in optimising the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase.
Snake envenomation is a major health problem in many tropical countries, with an estimated 1.8 million people affected annually and about 94,000 deaths. Antivenoms are the only effective treatment for these cases, but the production of these antisera is challenging. In this study, we developed a new immunization protocol for producing potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers in Thailand and its neighboring countries. The protocol involved immunizing horses with a mixture of the three viper venoms using the "low dose, low volume, multi-site" method. The antisera showed rapid rise in ELISA titers against the three venoms and reached plateau at about the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against the three venoms was much higher than the minimal potency limits set by Queen Soavabha Memorial Institute. The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. This effective immunization protocol should be useful in the production of potent polyspecific antisera against snake venoms and equine antisera against tetanus, diphtheria, or rabies.
 Salmonella enterica is a pathogenic bacterial species that causes systemic infections in humans and animals. In mice, Salmonella typhimurium can establish a chronic systemic infection that lasts for months. We have identified the bacterial effector protein SseI as a critical factor for this long-term infection. SseI inhibits normal cell migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro, and this inhibition requires the host factor IQGAP1. SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. In addition, infection with wild-type Salmonella suppresses dendritic cell migration to the spleen in vivo in an SseI-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which ultimately counteracts the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria.
 We report that the transcription product of the psm-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec of HA-MRSA, but not CA-MRSA, suppresses the expression of phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. We found that psm-mec RNA inhibits translation of the agrA gene encoding a positive transcription factor for the PSMα gene via specific binding to agrA mRNA. Furthermore, 25% of 325 clinical MRSA isolates had a mutation in the psm-mec promoter that attenuated transcription, and 9% of the strains had no psm-mec. In most of these psm-mec-mutated or psm-mec-deleted HA-MRSA strains, PSMα expression was increased compared with strains carrying intact psm-mec, and some mutated strains produced high amounts of PSMα comparable with that of CA-MRSA. Deletion of psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains carrying intact psm-mec increased the expression of AgrA protein and PSMα, and virulence in mice. Thus, psm-mec RNA suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of agrA translation and the absence of psm-mec function in CA-MRSA causes its high virulence property.
 Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The disease can range from mild to severe, with the potential for life-threatening complications. The current understanding of dengue pathogenesis is limited due to the lack of suitable animal models. We have previously reported that AG129 mice, which lack type I interferon receptors, can be used as a model for dengue infection. In this study, we used A129 mice, which have an intact type I interferon receptor signaling pathway, to investigate the role of type I interferon in dengue pathogenesis. We found that A129 mice born to dengue immune mothers were more susceptible to dengue infection and developed severe disease compared to mice born to naive mothers. Our results suggest that type I interferon plays a protective role in dengue pathogenesis.
 The study is the first systematic review with meta-analysis about factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection in humans in the Americas. The study found that male sex, younger individuals, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were associated with L. infantum infection. The study also identified some inconsistencies in the results of the studies analyzed, which may be due to differences in the quality of the studies, the design used, the methods of data analysis, the control for confounders, and the way results were reported. The study highlights the need for more well-designed studies to better understand the factors associated with L. infantum infection in the Americas.
 Francisella tularensis ( Ft ) is a highly pathogenic bacterium that causes acute and fatal pneumonia in humans and animals . The lung cytokine milieu favors exponential Ft replication, but the mechanisms underlying acute pathogenesis and death remain unknown . In this study, the authors found that in contrast to overwhelming bacterial burden or cytokine production, an overt innate cellular response to Ft drives tissue pathology and host mortality . They also found that lethal infection with Ft elicits medullary and extra-medullary myelopoiesis supporting recruitment of large numbers of immature myeloid cells and MDSC to the lungs . These cells fail to mature and die, leading to subsequent necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and host death that is partially dependent upon immature Ly6G+ cells . The authors suggest that acceleration of this process may account for the rapid lethality seen with Ft SchuS4 . In contrast, during sub-lethal infection with Ft LVS the pulmonary cellular response is characterized by a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes required for protection, suggesting a required threshold for lethal bacterial infection . Further, eliciting a mature phagocyte response provides transient, but dramatic, innate protection against Ft SchuS4 . This study reveals that the nature of the myeloid cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection .
 The Asian tiger mosquito ( Ae . albopictus ) is a vector of several arboviruses, including chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. It has been rapidly spreading around the world, and its invasion has been facilitated by human activities. In this study, we used population genetics and Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) approaches to infer the demographic history of Ae . albopictus populations from different regions. We found that the invasion process of this mosquito was primarily supported by a chaotic propagule distribution, which cooperates in maintaining a relatively high genetic diversity within the adventive populations. Our results suggest that independent and trans-continental introductions of Ae . albopictus may have facilitated the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes. This may extend to the genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence, which may contribute to creating the conditions for the efficient transmission of arboviruses and for outbreak establishment.
 The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of both acute and chronic infections. While much is known about acute infections, the mechanisms of chronic infections are not well understood. In this study, we examined the genes and functions that are important for the fitness of P. aeruginosa in chronic wound infections. We found that clinical isolates from chronic wounds were often defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation. We also found that many virulence and biofilm formation genes were not required for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, some metabolic and energy pathways, and membrane integrity were critical. These findings suggest that different bacterial functions are important in different phases of infection. We also found that some wound-impaired mutants could be represented by anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane-stress conditions ex vivo, and more comprehensively by high-density bacterial growth conditions in the absence of a host. These data provide insights into the bacterial functions needed in chronic wound infections, the nature of stresses applied to bacteria at infection sites, and suggest therapeutic targets that might compromise wound infection pathogenesis.
 Bancroftian filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that affects approximately 100 million persons worldwide . It is estimated that 40 million persons suffer from the chronic disfiguring manifestations of this disease, including 27 million men with testicular hydrocele, lymph scrotum, or elephantiasis of the scrotum . The genital pathology caused by bancroftosis is impressively debilitating and economically punishing for huge numbers of adult males throughout endemic countries. There is consensus that hydrocele is the most frequent clinical manifestation of bancroftian filariasis. On the other hand, few systematic studies of the prevalence or incidence of hydrocele in temperate climates have been published. In spite of this, there appears to be a difference between the hydrocele prevalence in temperate countries and tropical and subtropical ones. In locations where bancroftian filariasis is highly endemic, up to 40% of adult males are reported to have testicular hydrocele. With exception of its posterior aspect, the testicle is covered by the tunica vaginalis formed by two layers. The visceral layer and parietal layer are in direct contact with the testis and the scrotum wall, respectively. Both layers have secretory ability and only the parietal layer has resorption property. Between the layers there is a space called vaginal cavity. The balance of secretory and absorptive functions of these layers results in a small volume (0.5 to 2.0 mL) of straw-colored fluid in this cavity. Outside of congenital hydrocele, the general mechanism accepted for abnormal chronic accumulation of fluid in the vaginal cavity, known as acquired hydrocele, irrespective of the etiology, is an unbalanced process between fluid production by the mesothelial cells of the inner surface of the tunica vaginalis and fluid absorption by the draining lymphatic vessels of the parietal layer. Surgery using different techniques is the standard treatment form for chronic hydrocele, regardless of the etiology, and the rationale for its repair is to expose, permanently, the secretory surface of tunica vaginalis to the absorbing surface of scrotal wall. In Greater Recife, northeastern Brazil, a bancroftian filariasis endemic area, the prevalence of acquired hydrocele in the adult male population is high, and hydrocelectomy represents a commonly performed procedure in public hospitals. At these hospitals, the surgeons' preference is for surgical techniques in which the hydrocele sac is opened, everted with or without partial resection of the sac, and the edges sutured behind the testis (J. Norões, personal communication). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the occurrence of lymphangiectasia in scrotal contents, the morphology and consistency of the testicles, and hydrocele recurrence using the complete excision of tunica vaginalis in hydrocele patients living in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area.
 Trichinella spiralis is a zoonotic parasite that causes trichinellosis, a disease that has been identified on all continents except Antarctica. During chronic infection, T. spiralis larvae infect skeletal myofibres, severely disrupting their differentiation state. In this study, an activity-based probe was used to identify deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity in lysate of T. spiralis L1 larvae. Results were analyzed by immuno-blot and immuno-precipitation, identifying a number of potential DUBs. Immuno-precipitated proteins were subjected to LC/MS/MS, yielding peptides with sequence homology to 5 conserved human DUBs: UCH-L5, UCH-L3, HAUSP, OTU 6B and Ataxin-3. The predicted gene encoding the putative UCH-L5 homologue, TsUCH37, was cloned and recombinant protein was expressed and purified. The deubiquitinating activity of this enzyme was verified by Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation of recombinant TsUCH37 showed that the protein associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. In addition, the UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 exhibited specific inhibition of recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae. This study reports the identification of the first T. spiralis DUB, a cysteine protease that is putatively orthologous to the human protein, hUCH-L5. Results suggest that the interaction of this protein with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution. We show potential for the use of inhibitor compounds to elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection and their investigation as therapeutic targets for trichinellosis.
 The cysteine protease cruzipain is a validated target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of Chagas disease, which is caused by the protozoan parasite T . cruzi . In this study, three nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors based on two scaffolds known to be associated with cathepsin K inhibition were tested for their anti-trypanosomal activity against the CL Brener strain of T . cruzi. The two compounds showing the greatest potency against the trypanosome were characterized by EC50 values that were an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding Ki values measured against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzipain, in an enzyme inhibition assay. This implies that the anti-trypanosomal activity of these two compounds may not be explained only by the inhibition of the cruzain enzyme, thereby triggering a putative polypharmacological profile towards cysteine proteases.
 Maize is one of the most important cereal crops in the world, and its genome is being sequenced to better understand its genetic and evolutionary makeup. To do this, a sequence-ready fingerprinted contig-based physical map was constructed that covers 93.5% of the genome and is anchored to the genetic map. The map contains 25,908 genic markers that enabled the alignment of nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. Inversions account for the majority of chromosome structural variations during subsequent maize diploidization. Reconstructing the paleoethnobotany of the maize genome indicates that the progenitors of modern maize contained ten chromosomes. This physical map will be a valuable resource for the ongoing maize genome sequencing project and for comparative genomics studies across the cereals.
 Prions are the proteinaceous infectious agents responsible for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Sporadic TSEs occur worldwide with an approximate frequency of 1 new case per million people each year. Molecularly, it is thought that sporadic TSEs arise from the low frequency spontaneous misfolding of the prion protein which then propagates to other PrPC molecules in a manner similar as in the infectious cases. In this study, we developed a new method to mimic an early event in the etiology of sporadic disease by attempting de novo generation of infectious PrPSc in vitro. Under standard PMCA conditions, and taking precautions to avoid cross-contamination, de novo generation of PrPSc was never observed, supporting the use of the technology for diagnostic applications. However, we report that PMCA can be modified to generate PrPSc in the absence of pre-existing PrPSc in different animal species at a low and variable rate. De novo generated PrPSc was infectious when inoculated into wild type hamsters, producing a new disease phenotype with unique clinical, neuropathological and biochemical features. Our findings represent additional evidence in support of the prion hypothesis and provide a simple model to study the mechanism of sporadic prion disease. The findings also suggest that prion diversity is not restricted to those currently known and that likely new forms of infectious protein foldings may be produced, resulting in novel disease phenotypes.
 We present a novel neurally based model for estimating angular velocity ( AV ) in the bee brain, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees. The model is fitted using electrophysiological data and tested using behavioural data. Based on our model, we suggest that the AV response can be considered as an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response. The detector is tested behaviourally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings on the walls. When combined with an existing flight control algorithm, the detector reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behaviour as found in the real bee’s behaviour. In addition, the summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer.
The study reports on a long-term follow-up of a cohort of 50 human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients from the Ivory Coast. The study found that 11 patients refused treatment after their initial diagnosis. In 10 out of 11 subjects who continued to refuse treatment despite repeated visits, parasite clearance was observed using both microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of these subjects also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens. Hence, in addition to the “classic” lethal outcome of HAT, the study shows that alternative natural progressions of HAT may occur: progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses and progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection associated with a progressive drop in antibody titres as observed in treated cases. The study demonstrates that a number of subjects display such infection courses. From the authors' point of view, recognizing that trypanotolerance exists in humans is a major step forward for future research in the field of HAT.
γ-irradiation is a well-known carcinogen that causes DNA damage and mutations. However, it is not clear how these mutations contribute to cancer development. In this study, the authors found that loss of the tumor suppressor gene p53 confers a survival advantage following γ-irradiation in short-term survival assays. They also found that p53 null hematopoietic cells are resistant to γ-irradiation-induced death and loss of clonogenic potential. However, the authors found that short-term resistance to genotoxic stress conferred by p53 mutation often does not correlate with long-term survival. The authors also found that irradiation dramatically accelerates tumorigenesis in p53 heterozygous adult mice. They suggest that loss of p53 function may be selected for following irradiation. The authors conclude that the carcinogenic action of γ-irradiation might involve both mutagenesis and selection for p53 loss.
 Schistosoma mansoni is a parasite that causes schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The parasite produces a serine protease inhibitor called SmKI-1, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, the authors investigated the role of SmKI-1 in parasite development and its ability to regulate different models of inflammatory diseases. They found that SmKI-1 inhibits neutrophil migration and function, and that it has the ability to bind to elastase, a protease that is involved in inflammation. The authors also demonstrated that SmKI-1 is essential for parasite survival in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the study suggests that SmKI-1 could be a promising therapeutic molecule for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
 Membrane proteins are essential for many cellular functions and are involved in many diseases. However, they are difficult to study because they are embedded in the cell membrane. To overcome this problem, researchers have developed methods to predict the structure of membrane proteins from their amino acid sequence. These methods are based on the idea that similar proteins have similar structures. However, membrane proteins have unique features that make them difficult to predict. To address this problem, researchers have developed a new method that uses a combination of different techniques to predict the structure of membrane proteins. This method has been tested on several different membrane proteins and has been shown to be very accurate. This method should be useful for predicting the structure of many different membrane proteins, which could help researchers understand how these proteins work and how they are involved in diseases.
 Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, a rare but serious disease. In this study, researchers used human hepatocytes and trophoblast cells to study the behavior of L. monocytogenes during a long-term infection. They found that bacteria cease to polymerize actin and are enclosed in vacuoles after the actin-dependent motility phase. This phenotypic switch is correlated with a decreased expression of ActA at the bacterial surface. In addition, ΔactA mutants enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state during long-term infection. The formation of LisCVs could potentially enable the persistence of this pathogen in epithelial tissues.
 This study presents a neuromechanistic model of auditory streaming that incorporates sensory feature dependent inputs and neuronal competition to predict the dynamics of alternating percepts in long-term auditory streaming. The model is based on the idea that the initial perceptual phase is followed by a series of irregular alternations between segregated and integrated percepts. The model is constrained by experimental data from a study that manipulated the frequency difference between tones in an ABA-triplet paradigm. The model predicts that the duration of the dominant percept is affected more by the frequency difference between tones than by the presentation rate. The study confirms this prediction and uses the behavioral data to further constrain and improve the model. The model provides a platform for studying other stimulus conditions and the effects of context and volition.
 Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The immune response to S. mansoni infection is characterized by a strong Th2 response, which is thought to be protective against reinfection. However, the specific antigens that trigger this response are not well understood. In this study, the authors developed a new method for assessing the allergenicity of S. mansoni antigens using a humanized rat basophilic leukemia cell line and wheat germ lysate translation. The method allows for rapid and high-throughput assessment of allergenicity without the need for purification of the translated proteins. The authors demonstrated the utility of the method by assessing the allergenicity of known S. mansoni allergens and identifying new allergens. The study provides a valuable tool for the development of safe and effective vaccines against S. mansoni.
 We here characterize the effects that divergence in the TE profile between parents has on offspring in the Drosophila virilis syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis. We show that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression when comparing genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses and these differences are transmitted to the next generation. Moreover, chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. Combined with these effects, we further demonstrate that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents that arise through polymorphic TE insertions. Overall, these results support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of both TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. This work demonstrates that divergence in the TE profile is associated with diverse piRNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.
 Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome ( FXTAS ) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5′UTR of the fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) gene , FMR1 . The expanded CGG repeat is thought to induce toxicity as RNA , and in FXTAS patients mRNA levels for FMR1 are markedly increased . Despite the critical role of FMR1 mRNA in disease pathogenesis , the basis for the increase in FMR1 mRNA expression is unknown . Here we show that overexpressing any of three histone deacetylases ( HDACs 3 , 6 , or 11 ) suppresses CGG repeat–induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS . This suppression results from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG repeat–containing transgene . These findings led us to evaluate the acetylation state of histones at the human FMR1 locus . In patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts , we determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation that there is increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus in pre-mutation carriers compared to control or FXS derived cell lines . These epigenetic changes correlate with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation carrier cell lines . Consistent with this finding , histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) inhibitors repress FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extend lifespan in CGG repeat–expressing Drosophila . These findings support a disease model whereby the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in cis , which in turn increases expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA . Moreover , these results provide proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus .
The immune system plays a crucial role in protecting the body from infections. However, during chronic infections, the immune system can become exhausted, leading to the development of immunopathology. In this study, researchers examined the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic viral infection. They found that increased MHC diversity allowed for a broader CD8 T cell response, which was able to more rapidly control persistent viral infection. However, F1 mice expressing a H-2bxd haplotype on different genetic backgrounds exhibited differences in both CD8 T cell exhaustion and CD4 T cell subset distribution, resulting in differences in viral control and disease. Unexpectedly, H-2bxd mice on a C57BL background succumbed to LCMV Cl-13 infection in a T-cell- and IFN-γ-dependent manner. These findings suggest that both MHC haplotype and genetic background together influence host resistance to CD8 T cell exhaustion and disease susceptibility following LCMV Cl-13 infection.
 Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It is endemic in many countries, including China, where it is primarily found in rural areas. In this study, the authors analyzed the genetic characteristics of B. anthracis strains isolated from anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. They used two methods, canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) analysis and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), to analyze the strains. The authors found that five sublineages/subgroups of B. anthracis were present in northwestern China, including A . Br . 001/002, A . Br . Vollum, A . Br . Aust94, A . Br . Ames and A . Br . 008/009. They also found that the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations in northwestern China was gradually becoming balanced. This study provides important information for the prevention and control of anthrax in China.
 The human intestinal microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms that plays a crucial role in maintaining human health. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influences host health are not well understood. In this study, we used a mouse model of intestinal inflammation to investigate the role of the microbiota in regulating host immunity. We found that the microbiota modulates host immunity by altering the expression of genes involved in immune signaling pathways. Specifically, we found that the microbiota regulates the expression of genes involved in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, which is important for recognizing and responding to pathogens. We also found that the microbiota regulates the expression of genes involved in the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, which is important for regulating the immune response to viral infections. These findings suggest that the microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating host immunity and that disruptions to the microbiota could lead to immune dysfunction and disease.
 Translation initiation is a critical step in the replication cycle of the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans. Norovirus RNA, which lacks a 5' cap and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), relies on interactions between the viral protein VPg and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the host cell for translation initiation. In this study, the authors have used pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to demonstrate that a stretch of ~20 amino acids at the C terminus of MNV VPg mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. The authors have found that this site is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A on eIF4G HEAT-1 by demonstrating that norovirus VPg can form ternary VPg-eIF4G-eIF4A complexes. These observations define important structural details of a functional interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G and reveal a binding interface that might be exploited as a target for antiviral therapy.
 The evolution of gene clusters in bacteria has been a topic of debate for many years. Several explanations have been proposed, including the selfish operon model, which suggests that gene clusters are more easily transferred to other species, and the persistence model, which suggests that genes that are in close proximity are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. In this study, the authors developed computational models to study the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve and persist. They found that gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions, but that factors such as a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and in the case of the selfish operon model, a high horizontal transfer rate, can promote the evolution of gene clusters. The authors also found that the selfish operon model is still viable as an explanation for the evolution of gene clusters under certain conditions.
 Plasmodium falciparum is a parasite that causes malaria in humans. It has a unique gene called var2csa that encodes a protein called VAR2CSA. This protein binds to a specific protein called chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) found in the placenta. VAR2CSA is important for the parasite to survive in the placenta. However, it is not clear how the parasite regulates the expression of this gene. In this study, we found a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5′ untranslated region of the var2csa gene. This uORF represses the translation of the var2csa mRNA. We also found that the parasite can selectively reverse this repression and actively translate the var2csa mRNA. These findings suggest that the parasite has an additional level of regulation for the expression of VAR2CSA. This regulation may help the parasite to adapt to different environments and to survive in the placenta.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a spectrum of disease outcomes ranging from mild to severe. The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection may be driven by host responses, which could be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells. We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua collected on days 3–6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In the dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, one subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. By performing a meta-analysis of our dataset in conjunction with previously published datasets, we confirmed that DENV infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, whereas in vitro infection leads to an increased interferon signature, this was not consistently observed from in vivo patient samples, suggesting that the interferon response in vivo is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3–6 of illness. These data highlight important differences between different manifestations of severity during DENV infection as well as identify some commonalities. Compilation of larger datasets in the future across multiple studies may well lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach.
 Herpesviruses are a group of viruses that cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. The difficulty of clearing established herpesvirus infections makes host entry an important target for disease control. However, how herpesviruses enter new hosts is not well understood. To study this process, we used the lymphotropic rhadinovirus Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), which is related to the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus. We found that MuHV-4 binds to heparan sulfate (HS) on the apical surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium, which is a complex site of HS-dependent herpesvirus uptake. Virions track down the neuronal cilia and either infect neurons or reach the underlying microvilli of the adjacent glial cells and infect them. Our findings provide important insights into how herpesviruses enter new hosts and may help inform strategies for disease control.
 In this study, we investigated the role of CRP-cAMP in the regulation of Salmonella virulence. We found that CRP-cAMP is required to silence SPI-1 genes in exponential growing cells and that this silencing is mediated by the sRNA Spot 42. Our results suggest that CRP-cAMP and Spot 42 form a novel regulatory axis that contributes to growth phase-specific activation of SPI-1 genes. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of Salmonella virulence and highlight the importance of the 3’UTR of mRNAs in post-transcriptional control in bacteria.
 Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. The expansion leads to the production of a mutant huntingtin protein that is toxic to cells. The expansion is unstable and can occur in somatic tissues, leading to tissue-specific degeneration. The mechanisms underlying this tissue-specific instability are not well understood. In this study, the authors used R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines to investigate the relationship between chromatin structure, transcription, and tissue-specific CAG instability. They found that the HD transgene is integrated in a more euchromatinized and transcriptionally active region in R6/2 mice than in R6/1 mice. However, chromatin accessibility and transcription initiation at the HD locus were similar in the striatum and cerebellum of R6 mice. The authors suggest that transcription elongation mediates tissue-specific somatic CAG instability in HD.
 Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) is a highly virulent enterovirus that causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease ( HFMD ) and meningoencephalitis in humans . The molecular features that enhance EV71's ability to disseminate in humans are unknown . In this study, we analyzed the genomes of EV71 from different sites of infection in an immunocompromised host with disseminated disease . We found three nucleotide changes that occurred within a five-day period: a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 located within the BC loop ( L97R ) , a region considered as an immunogenic site and possibly important in poliovirus host adaptation; a conservative amino acid substitution in protein 2B ( A38V ) ; and a silent mutation in protein 3D ( L175 ) . Infectious clones were constructed using both BrCr ( lineage A ) and the clinical strain ( lineage C ) backgrounds containing either one or both non-synonymous mutations . In vitro cell tropism and competition assays revealed that the VP197 Leu to Arg substitution within the BC loop conferred a replicative advantage in SH-SY5Y cells of neuroblastoma origin . Interestingly , this mutation was frequently associated in vitro with a second non-conservative mutation ( E167G or E167A ) in the VP1 EF loop in neuroblastoma cells . Comparative models of these EV71 VP1 variants were built to determine how the substitutions might affect VP1 structure and/or interactions with host cells and suggest that , while no significant structural changes were observed , the substitutions may alter interactions with host cell receptors . Taken together , our results show that the VP1 BC loop region of EV71 plays a critical role in cell tropism independent of EV71 lineage and , thus , may have contributed to dissemination and neurotropism in the immunocompromised patient .
 ComRS is a quorum sensing system that regulates natural transformation in Streptococcus species. It consists of a peptide pheromone (XIP) that is processed, secreted, and imported into the cytoplasm, where it binds and activates the transcription factor ComR. ComR then engages in a positive feedback loop for the expression of ComS and the alternative sigma-factor SigX. The sequence of both ComS/XIP and ComR diverges significantly among Streptococcus species, suggesting a mechanism for species-specific communication. To study possible cross-talk between streptococcal species in the regulation of competence, and to explore in detail the molecular interaction between ComR and XIP, we undertook an interdisciplinary approach. We developed a ‘test-bed’ assay to measure the activity of different ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides in vivo, revealing distinct ComR classes of strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. We then solved an X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S. suis to further understand the interaction with XIP and to search for structural features in ComR proteins that may explain XIP recognition. Using the structure as a guide, we probed the apo conformation of the XIP-binding pocket by site-directed mutagenesis, both in test-bed cultures and biochemically in vitro. In alignments with ComR proteins from other species, we find that the pocket is lined by a variable and a conserved face, where residues of the conserved face contribute to ligand binding and the variable face discriminate among XIP peptides. Together, our results not only provide a model for XIP recognition and specificity, but also allow for the prediction of novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity.
 Centromeres are essential components of eukaryotic chromosomes that determine how chromosomes are segregated during cell division. In most eukaryotes, centromeres are not defined by a specific DNA sequence, but rather by epigenetic mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we used the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans as a model organism to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. We found that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that fires first on its respective chromosome. Furthermore, changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of origin recognition complex (ORC) association with centromere regions. Finally, analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. We suggest a model in which the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position.
 Back pain is a major health problem worldwide, causing more years of disability than any other condition.  In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of chronic back pain (CBP) in adults of European ancestry from 16 community- and population-based cohorts. We found a genome-wide significant association between CBP and an intronic variant in the SOX5 gene. We also found suggestive associations with two other loci in the discovery sample, which reached genome-wide significance in a joint meta-analysis with the UK Biobank. Our findings provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying CBP and may lead to new therapeutic targets.
 The study aimed to estimate the economic and public health burden of Taenia solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon. The cost and Disability Adjusted Life Year ( DALY ) estimations were applied. The prevalence of epilepsy was estimated at 3.6%, resulting in 50,326 people with neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy, representing 1.0% of the local population. The number of pigs diagnosed with cysticercosis was estimated at 15,961, corresponding to 5.6% of the local pig population. The total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon were estimated at 10,255,202 Euro, of which 4.7% were due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The average number of DALYs lost was 9.0 per thousand persons per year. The study provides an estimation of the costs and public health burden of T. solium cysticercosis using country-specific parameters and including the human as well as the animal burden of the zoonotic disease. A comparison with a study in South Africa indicates that the cost of inactivity, influenced by salaries, plays a predominant role in the monetary burden of T. solium cysticercosis. Ascertaining this finding with additional studies in cysticercosis-endemic countries could eventually allow the estimation of the global disease burden of cysticercosis. The estimated number of DALYs lost due to the disease was higher than estimates already available for some other neglected tropical diseases. The total estimated cost and number of DALYs lost probably underestimate the real values because the estimations have been based on epilepsy as the only symptom of cysticercosis.
 Staphylococcus aureus is a common human commensal and opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide range of infections. The bacteria have evolved complex regulatory circuits that allow rapid adaptation to different hosts and ecological niches. In this study, the authors discovered a new regulatory RNA called RsaA that represses the translation of the mgrA mRNA, which codes for a master regulator of transcription. Through MgrA regulation, RsaA activates biofilm formation and inhibits capsule synthesis. Experimental animal models showed that RsaA attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection. These data indicate that RsaA is part of a regulatory circuit that contributes to the complex interactions of S . aureus with the eukaryotic immune system.
 HIV-1 uncoating is a critical step in the infection process, but it is poorly understood. We developed a novel strategy to visualize HIV-1 uncoating using a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of a capsid-binding host protein cyclophilin A ( CypA-DsRed ) , which is specifically packaged into virions through the high-avidity binding to capsid ( CA ) . Single virus imaging reveals that CypA-DsRed remains associated with cores after permeabilization/removal of the viral membrane and that CypA-DsRed and CA are lost concomitantly from the cores in vitro and in living cells . The rate of loss is modulated by the core stability and is accelerated upon the initiation of reverse transcription . We show that the majority of single cores lose CypA-DsRed shortly after viral fusion , while a small fraction remains intact for several hours . Single particle tracking at late times post-infection reveals a gradual loss of CypA-DsRed which is dependent on reverse transcription . Uncoating occurs both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane . Our novel imaging assay thus enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 uncoating in living cells , and reveals the previously unappreciated spatio-temporal features of this incompletely understood process .
 The study aimed to assess the statistical information potential of different DNA ‘word-sizes’ and explore how oligonucleotide frequencies differ in coding and non-coding regions. The study found that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short range correlated. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. Bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were also found to be approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes. GC-rich genomes were more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes. The differences found between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may possibly be attributed to lifestyle, since tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was, on average, more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria.
 Recombination is a crucial process for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. In humans, recombination occurs at specific regions called hotspots. The factors that regulate recombination at these hotspots are not well understood. In this study, the authors analyzed both crossover and noncrossover recombinant molecules at six hotspots in human sperm DNA. They found a novel form of biased transmission that was exclusive to the noncrossover class of recombinant molecules. This bias was not predicted to lead to hotspot attenuation but represents a previously unappreciated yet significant source of meiotic drive operating in the human genome. The authors suggest that this bias may be due to differences in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair between crossovers and noncrossovers. This study provides important insights into the regulation of recombination at human hotspots.
 Exposure to environmental chemicals and drugs can have negative effects on human health. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these compounds is needed to determine their risk. We present a high confidence human protein-protein association network built upon the integration of chemical toxicology and systems biology. This computational systems chemical biology model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, thus predicting which compounds may be risk factors for human health. Additionally, the network can be used to identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals and proteins. Examples are shown for chemicals associated with breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, and potential protein targets for di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pirinixic acid, and permethrine. The chemical-protein associations are supported through recent published studies, which illustrate the power of our approach that integrates toxicogenomics data with other data types.
 We have developed a new type of receptive field model, the network receptive field ( NRF ), to better understand the neural processing of auditory cortical neurons. The NRF model is composed of a hierarchical feedforward network of 20 linear-nonlinear units, which are connected in a way that captures the nonlinear interactions of sensory filters. The NRF model outperforms conventional linear-nonlinear models in predicting the responses of auditory cortical neurons to natural stimuli. The NRF model reveals sensitivity over a substantially larger spectrotemporal domain than conventional models, and distinct nonlinear properties such as gain control and conjunctive feature selectivity. These findings suggest that the NRF model provides a valuable tool for understanding the neural processing of auditory cortical neurons.
 The circadian clock is a complex system that regulates the timing of various biological processes in organisms. The clock is composed of a set of transcription factors that operate in feedback loops to drive rhythmic gene expression. One of the key transcription factors in the clock is BMAL1, which is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in a rhythmic manner. We have now identified a novel role for the cryptochrome (CRY) protein in regulating BMAL1 phosphorylation. CRY binds to CK2 and inhibits its activity, leading to a decrease in BMAL1 phosphorylation. This negative feedback loop is critical for the proper functioning of the clock. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the circadian clock and may have implications for the treatment of circadian rhythm disorders.
 Bile is a fluid that contains bile salts, cholesterol, and a variety of proteins and electrolytes. It is synthesized by parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) in the liver and aids in the digestion of fats, facilitates absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in the intestine, and contributes to the elimination of excess cholesterol and waste metabolic products produced in the liver. Bile salts disrupt membranes, denature proteins, and damage DNA. Salmonella enterica is a bacterium that colonizes the hepatobiliary tract during systemic infection and persists in the gall bladder during chronic infection. Salmonella is resistant to the antibacterial activities of bile salts and can survive in the bile-laden gall bladder lumen. The mechanisms employed by Salmonella to thrive in the harsh environment of the gall bladder are not well understood. In this study, the authors describe mechanisms employed by Salmonella to survive bile. They found that adaptation to bile involves multiple changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the RpoS-dependent general stress response and other stress responses. They also found that individual cells can become bile-resistant without adaptation, and that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in gene expression. The authors propose that bile resistance can be acquired by mutation or by activation of bile resistance responses in a subpopulation of bacterial cells. They also found that batch Salmonella cultures contain cells that show high levels of bile resistance without previous adaptation. This phenomenon, called preadaptation, seems to involve two unrelated processes: mutation in specific loci and activation of bile resistance responses in a subpopulation of bacterial cells. The authors suggest that fluctuations in gene expression can have adaptive value.
 The E. coli chromosome is compacted by segregation into supercoiled domains. We found that prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by the proximal location of Mu termini L and R, which are 37 kbp apart on the Mu genome. Formation/maintenance of the Mu ‘domain’ configuration was dependent on a strong gyrase site at the center of Mu, the Mu L end and MuB protein, and the E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis and HU. By contrast, prophage λ does not form an independent domain. We propose that the domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by fostering topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. The potential benefits to the host cell from a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage may in turn help its long-term stability.
The study aimed to investigate the dynamics of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) gametocytes in children with malaria in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The study used a randomized treatment-to-reinfection cohort design, where children received radical cure with chloroquine (CQ) plus either primaquine (PQ) or placebo. Blood samples were collected at 2-4 week intervals over 8 months. Gametocytes were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR targeting pvs25 and pfs25. The study found that PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, which was comparable to the effect of PQ on incidence of blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79% of Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and to a lesser extent Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of gametocytes were significantly reduced in mixed-species infections compared to single-species infections for both species (ORPv = 0.39 [95% CI 0.25–0.62], ORPf = 0.33 [95% CI 0.18–0.60], p<0.001). No difference between the PQ and placebo treatment arms was observed in density of Pv gametocytes or in the proportion of Pv infections that carried gametocytes. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment, likely caused by a relapsing hypnozoite, were equally likely to carry gametocytes than first infections after PQ treatment, likely caused by an infective mosquito bite. Pv relapses and new infections are associated with similar levels of gametocytaemia. Relapses thus contribute considerably to the Pv reservoir highlighting the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv.
 The Rho family of GTPases control actin organization during diverse cellular responses, including migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. The basic mechanism involves targeting to the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. Our hypothesis is that the details of GTPase cycling between membrane and cytosol are key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches. We developed a modeling framework to analyze experimental data for these systems and found that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. Non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTPase are presented in multidimensional charts. The charts are used to illustrate the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane bound GTPase. The charts can be used as a guide in assessing how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios.
 Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms that infect the intestines or urinary tract. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem for schistosomiasis. To achieve these goals, mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel is recommended for school-aged children (SAC) once every 3 years in low prevalence settings, and treatment of SAC as well as adults considered to be at risk of infection once every 2 years in moderate prevalence settings and once a year in high prevalence settings. However, adults are also likely to be infected. We used three different age-intensity profiles of infection for Schistosoma mansoni with low, moderate, and high burdens of infection in adults to investigate how the age distribution of infection impacts the mathematical model generated recommendations of the preventive chemotherapy coverage levels required to achieve the WHO goals. We found that for moderate prevalence regions, regardless of the burden of infection in adults, treating SAC only may achieve the WHO goals. However, for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet the WHO goals. Hence, we show that the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region requires consideration of the burden of infection in adults as it cannot be based solely on the prevalence of infection in SAC. We highlight the importance of collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, specifically the inclusion of adult data at baseline (prior to treatment) and throughout the treatment programme if possible, rather than SAC only, to accurately determine the treatment strategy for a defined region. Furthermore, we discuss additional epidemiological data, such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, that should ideally be collected in M&E programmes.
 Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. In the case of drug-resistant epilepsy, resective surgery is often considered. However, the success rate of this procedure is unpredictable, with many patients continuing to have seizures even after surgery. In this study, we applied a computational model of epilepsy to patient-specific structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 individuals with left temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 39 healthy controls. We validated the model by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset time and network location. We then investigated the potential of the model for surgery prediction by performing in silico surgical resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing seizure likelihood post-surgery to pre-surgery simulations. We found that patients tend to transit from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls in the model. Regions in the left hemisphere (particularly within temporal and subcortical regions) that are known to be involved in TLE are the most frequent starting points for seizures in patients in the model. In addition, our analysis also implicates regions in the contralateral and frontal locations which may play a role in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. Finally, the model predicts that patient-specific surgery (resection areas chosen on an individual, model-prompted, basis and not following a predefined procedure) may lead to better outcomes than the currently used routine clinical procedure. Taken together, this work provides a first step towards patient-specific computational modelling of epilepsy surgery to inform treatment strategies in individuals.
 Human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV-8 ) is a virus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare cancer that affects the skin and lymph nodes. The virus has been linked to other types of cancer as well. The virus has several genes that help it to replicate and survive in the body. One of these genes, vIRF-1, has been shown to have oncogenic properties. However, it is not clear how vIRF-1 helps the virus to replicate and survive. In this study, the authors found that vIRF-1 binds to and inactivates a protein called Bim, which is important for controlling the replication of the virus. The authors also found that blocking the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim can help to control the replication of the virus. These findings suggest that targeting the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim could be a useful strategy for controlling the replication of HHV-8.
αVβ6 is an epithelial-restricted integrin that plays a key role in maintaining the balance between effective immune surveillance and lung anatomy and physiology. In this study, the authors show that β6 KO mice are protected from influenza virus-induced disease as well as a broad range of respiratory pathogens. The authors found that epithelial β6 controls the homeostatic lung interferon response, and in the absence of β6, type I interferon signaling is constitutive. This protective phenotype was reversed by exogenous TGF-β1 or elimination of the type I interferon receptor, suggesting that αVβ6 controls a communication system between lung epithelia and immune cells through a TGF-β-dependent mechanism. These studies have important implications as transient inhibition of αVβ6 may represent a potential therapy for the management of acute lung injury.
 Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites and transmitted by sandflies. It is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is challenging due to the low parasite burden in lesions. The Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) is a support tool for diagnosis based on delayed type hypersensitivity responses to Leishmania antigens injected intradermally. This study assessed the usefulness of LST as a support tool in the diagnosis of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) in a reference center in Argentina. The study included 733 cases that met the case definition, with 678 cases of cutaneous lesions, 50 cases of mucosal involvement, and 5 cases of disseminated disease. Diagnostic confirmation was reached in 474 cases through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 cases among this group having negative LST. Among smear negative cases, 190 were negative also by LST, but in 69 instances LST was positive. The findings support the clinical use of LST as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis across all age groups even in endemic areas. In this analysis, the correlation with smear was high. Standardization of this technique and further research into its most adequate preparation and utilization protocols across different sites will help in the management of suspicious clinical cases.
 Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis, a form of chronic inflammation in arterial walls, is a key pathophysiological event in CAD. We used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify 40 loci that affect CAD risk. We then used open chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq) and enhancer and transcription factor mapping using chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP-seq) in primary human macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). We found that oxLDL-induced foam cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and active enhancer sites that strongly correlated with expression changes of nearby genes. We also identified a regulatory variant rs72664324 at the PPAP2B locus that affects CAD risk through altered C/EBP-beta binding and enhancer activity. Our results demonstrate a genetic mechanism contributing to CAD risk at the PPAP2B locus and highlight the value of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic environmental stimuli.
5.0-9.9% districts are those in which the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in 1-9-year-olds is between 5.0% and 9.9%. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that in such districts, TF prevalence should be assessed in each sub-district (groupings of at least three villages) and three rounds of azithromycin treatment offered to any sub-district in which TF≥10%. However, this recommendation may not be practical due to the large number of endemic districts worldwide and the human and financial resources required to conduct surveys. In a group of 8 Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalences of 5.0-9.9%, the Malawi Ministry of Health administered one round of azithromycin mass treatment to the whole of each district, achieving mean coverage of ~80%. Here, we report impact surveys conducted after that treatment. We undertook population-based trachoma surveys in 18 evaluation units of the 8 treated districts, at least 6 months after the MDA. The standardized training package and survey methodologies of Tropical Data, which conform to WHO recommendations, were used. Each of the 18 evaluation units had a TF1-9 prevalence <5.0%. The study demonstrates that in Malawi districts with TF of 5.0-9.9%, one round of azithromycin MDA with ~80% coverage associates with a reduction in TF prevalence to <5.0%. Further evidence for this approach should be collected elsewhere.
 In plants, the NLR ( Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat ) protein complex senses infections and triggers robust immune responses. The NLR protein RPS2 recognizes the effector AvrRpt2 and activates a convergent immune response, including PCD ( programmed cell death ) , ROS ( reactive oxygen species ) production and transcriptional reprogramming. Functional genomic and biochemical genetic screens identified six closely related Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases ( CPKs ) in mediating bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins. The dynamics of differential CPK1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death. Sustained CPK4/5/6/11 activation directly phosphorylates a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors to synergistically regulate transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth. CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases for ROS production. Our studies delineate bifurcation of complex signaling mechanisms downstream of NLR immune sensors mediated by the myriad action of CPKs with distinct substrate specificity and subcellular dynamics.
 Schistosoma sp. are parasites that infect millions of people worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These parasites cause severe health problems, including terminal hematuria, and are transmitted through water. In this study, the authors used a statistical model to predict the incidence of Schistosoma haematobium in the district of Niono, Mali. The model was based on historical data and was able to accurately predict the incidence of the disease over a five-month period. The authors suggest that this model could be used to help manage and control the spread of Schistosoma sp. infections in the district of Niono and potentially other areas in the Sahel region of Africa.
 Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a common and often asymptomatic infection that can cause severe complications in immunocompromised individuals. HCMV has evolved a unique strategy to control the cell cycle by targeting cyclin A, a key regulator of the G1/S phase transition. The viral protein pp150 binds to cyclin A and prevents viral gene expression in S/G2 cells, which are normally permissive to HCMV infection. In this study, we show that pp150 and another viral protein, pUL21a, work together to synchronize the cell cycle in G2 phase, which is conducive to HCMV replication. We also show that disruption of both pp150 and pUL21a-RXL motifs leads to mitotic entry of infected cells, resulting in a severe negative impact on cell viability and virus growth. Our findings suggest that pp150 and pUL21a are part of a fail-safe system that ensures undisturbed HCMV replication under non-mitotic conditions.
 We used next generation sequencing to study the genetic basis of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases. We found a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases versus controls, indicating that we are likely identifying disease associated mutations. This study highlights the utility of next generation sequencing techniques combined with functional studies and rare variant analysis tools to provide insight into the genetic etiology of a heterogeneous sporadic disease.
 Influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The development of effective vaccines against influenza virus is a major challenge. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a cytokine that plays a critical role in the immune response to influenza virus. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-6 in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus. We found that IL-6 is required for the development of CD4+ T cell memory to influenza virus. IL-6 suppresses CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are known to suppress the immune response to influenza virus. Our results suggest that IL-6 promotes the development of CD4+ T cell memory to influenza virus by limiting the activity of Tregs. These findings have important implications for the development of effective vaccines against influenza virus.
Dnmt2 is a DNA and tRNA methyltransferase that has been found to be involved in the control of repetitive elements in lower eukaryotes. However, its function in higher eukaryotes is not well understood. In this study, we identified enolase as a Dnmt2-binding protein using a yeast two-hybrid screen. Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. We found that enolase acts as a Dnmt2 inhibitor and that its activity is antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate. Interestingly, glucose starvation drives enolase to accumulate within the nucleus, leading to the formation of additional enolase-Ehmeth complexes and a significant reduction of tRNAAsp methylation in the parasite. These results establish enolase as the first Dnmt2 interacting protein and highlight an unexpected role of a glycolytic enzyme in the modulation of Dnmt2 activity.
 Mosquitoes transmit many diseases to humans, including Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ). Mosquito saliva contains many secretory factors that modulate the feeding foci to enhance pathogen infection and establishment . In this study, we identified 103 exogenous microRNAs in mosquito saliva, including 31 novel miRNAs. Several of these saliva miRNAs were found to be expressed only in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes. Five of the saliva miRNAs were tested for their potential to regulate CHIKV infection, and our results demonstrate their functional role in the transmission and establishment of infection during blood feeding on the host.
 Mitochondria contain their own genome, which encodes several proteins required for cellular respiration. Deletions in the mitochondrial genome have been linked to several diseases and cancers. The current understanding of mitochondrial DNA repair is limited compared to nuclear DNA repair. In this study, we investigated the contribution of nuclear double-strand break repair proteins Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p in mitochondrial DNA repair. We found that loss of these proteins significantly decreases the rate of spontaneous deletion events and impairs the repair of induced mitochondrial DNA double-strand breaks. These findings suggest that these proteins play important roles in mitochondrial DNA repair and may be potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
 Rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) is a major disease burden among disadvantaged populations globally . It results from acute rheumatic fever ( ARF ) , a complication of Group A Streptococcal ( GAS ) infection . These conditions are acknowledged as diseases of poverty , however the role of specific social and environmental factors in GAS infection and progression to ARF/RHD is not well understood . The aim of this systematic review was to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS infection , ARF and RHD , and the effect of interventions targeting these . We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed , the Cochrane Library and Embase . Observational and experimental studies that measured: crowding , dwelling characteristics , education , employment , income , nutrition , or socioeconomic status and the relationship with GAS infection , ARF or RHD were included . Findings for each factor were assessed against the Bradford Hill criteria for evidence of causation . Study quality was assessed using a standardised tool . 1 , 164 publications were identified . 90 met inclusion criteria , comprising 91 individual studies . 49 ( 50 . 5% ) were poor quality in relation to the specific study question . The proportion of studies reporting significant associations between socioeconomic determinants and risk of GAS infection was 57 . 1% , and with ARF/RHD was 50% . Crowding was the most assessed factor ( 14 studies with GAS infection , 36 studies with ARF/RHD ) followed by socioeconomic status ( 6 and 36 respectively ) . The majority of studies assessing crowding , dwelling characteristics , education and employment status of parents or cases , and nutrition , reported a positive association with risk of GAS infection , ARF or RHD . Crowding and socioeconomic status satisfactorily met the criteria of a causal association . There was substantial heterogeneity across all key study aspects . The extensive literature examining the role of social determinants in GAS infection , ARF and RHD risk lacks quality . Most were observational , not interventional . Crowding as a cause of GAS infection and ARF/RHD presents a practical target for prevention actions . , Introduction:  Rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) is an important cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality in disadvantaged populations globally [1–4] . It results from acute rheumatic fever ( ARF ) , which itself occurs as an abnormal immunological response to Group A Streptococcal ( GAS ) infection of the throat ( streptococcal pharyngitis ) and possibly streptococcal skin infection[5] in susceptible hosts [6] . GAS pharyngitis is spread through direct person-to-person transmission via saliva or nasal secretions [7] . Generally very few people will develop ARF after GAS exposure , but it may be as high as 5 to 6% in certain groups with greater susceptibility and heavy GAS exposure [8] . Recurrences of ARF cause progressive valvular damage , with between 50 and 75% of cases progressing to RHD [8] . RHD is a chronic and debilitating condition characterised by complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure [6] . ARF and RHD most often affect children and young adults [2] . The true burden of the disease is expected to be far higher than the benchmark estimates , but even at conservative calculations , it is equivalent to approximately one quarter of the global DALY burden of cancer [3] . Globally , ARF and RHD are almost exclusively seen in developing nations or among disadvantaged populations within developed nations [2] . Among populations safeguarded by high standards of living , RHD rates are virtually zero . This dramatic contrast highlights the influence of environmental , economic , social and behavioural conditions on risk of GAS infection and progression to ARF and RHD . Despite the role of social determinants of health in disease genesis , key RHD control programs and guidelines[4 , 9 , 10] do not specifically address primordial prevention . Primordial prevention aspires to establish and maintain conditions to minimize hazards to health . It consists of actions and measures that inhibit the emergence and establishment of environmental , economic , social and behavioural conditions , cultural patterns of living known to increase the risk of disease[11]–that is , strategies that aim to eliminate exposure to risk factors in the first place . Current strategies focus on primary prevention ( early detection and treatment of GAS infections ) , secondary prevention ( delivering intramuscular penicillin
 In this study, we found that a single point mutation in the histidine kinase PhoQ of the E. coli PhoQ/PhoP signaling network resulted in a striking change in the properties of the circuit. The mutant responded to stimulus in a bistable manner, with mutant cells in on and off states having different morphologies and their state being inherited over many generations. The bistability depended on positive autoregulation of the two key proteins in the circuit, PhoP and PhoQ. The mutant came at a substantial fitness cost, with relative fitness being lower in the on state in stationary phase cultures in rich medium. However, due to the high inheritance of the on state, a population of on cells could be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. Our results demonstrate the remarkable versatility of the prototypical two-component signaling architecture and highlight the tradeoffs in the particular case of the PhoQ/PhoP system.
 Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba that occasionally infects humans, causing a rare but devastating disease called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). The lack of effective treatments for PAM makes it a particularly problematic infection. In this study, the authors investigated the possibility of repurposing anti-fungal azole drugs for the treatment of PAM. They found that N . fowleri has an essential requirement for ergosterol, a building block of plasma and cell membranes, and that disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated interventional strategy against fungal pathogens. The authors also found that N . fowleri CYP51, a target sharing ~35% sequence identity to fungal orthologues, is a potentially ‘druggable’ target in N . fowleri and that conazole drugs are effective against both the whole organism and the recombinant molecular target. The study provides a foundation for the development of new treatments for PAM.
 The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that work together to protect the body from invading pathogens. One of the key players in the immune system is the interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) , which is involved in the development and maintenance of type 2 immune responses. In this study, the authors used a mouse model to investigate the role of IL-4Rα in the maintenance of type 2 immune responses following infection with a parasitic nematode. They found that sustained expression of IL-4Rα is required for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following interruption after polarization with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis primary infection. Moreover, they showed that signaling via this receptor drives more efficient recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of the parasites prior to secondary infection with N . brasiliensis. These findings suggest that IL-4Rα plays a critical role in the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and the recall of protective memory responses.
 Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution and transmission of Bartonella bacteria, which are prevalent in mammals and cause numerous human infections. We analyzed patterns of Bartonella transmission and likely sources of spillover using the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes assembled, including 67 new genotypes. Our results suggest that Bartonella likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as the reservoirs or at least key proximate host for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. We also find evidence of exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife, likely due to increased contact. Care should be taken to avoid contact between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife to protect the health of all.
 We have demonstrated that MALAT1, a long noncoding RNA, is regulated during normal cell cycle progression. We found that MALAT1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. The cell cycle defects observed in MALAT1-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating that p53 is a major downstream mediator of MALAT1 activity. Furthermore, we found that MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle–regulated transcription factors. These findings provide mechanistic insights on the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation.
20-hydroxyecdysone ( 20E ) and juvenile hormone ( JH ) are two key endocrine regulators of insect development and reproduction. JH is known to promote vitellogenesis, the process of egg production, in many insects. However, the molecular basis of JH action in promoting vitellogenesis is poorly understood. We used RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes in JH-deprived fat bodies and those further treated with a JH analog. We found that DNA replication was a top hit in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. We postulated that Met, the JH receptor, mediated JH-stimulated DNA replication in the fat body during locust vitellogenesis. We showed that Mcm4 and Mcm7, two genes involved in DNA replication, were expressed in response to JH and that Met directly regulated the transcription of these genes. Our study provides insight into the molecular basis of JH action in promoting vitellogenesis.
20-week and 32-week prednisolone courses are commonly used to treat nerve function impairment ( NFI ) in leprosy patients, but the optimal treatment duration has not yet been established. In this study, we evaluated whether a 32-week prednisolone course is more effective than a 20-week course in restoring and improving nerve function. In this multi-centre, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, leprosy patients who had recently developed clinical NFI were allocated to a prednisolone treatment regimen of either 20 weeks or 32 weeks. Prednisolone was started at either 45 or 60 mg/day, depending on the patient’s body weight, and was then tapered. Throughout follow-up, NFI was assessed by voluntary muscle testing and monofilament testing. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at week 78. As secondary outcomes, we analysed improvements between baseline and week 78 on the Reaction Severity Scale, the SALSA Scale, and the Participation Scale. Serious Adverse Events and the need for additional prednisolone treatment were monitored and reported. We included 868 patients in the study, 429 in the 20-week arm and 439 in the 32-week arm. At 78 weeks, the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ significantly between the groups: 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in the 32-week arm (p = 0.821). Nor were there any differences in secondary outcomes, except for a significant higher proportion of Serious Adverse Events in the longer treatment arm. In our study, a 20-week course of prednisolone was as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. Twenty weeks is therefore the preferred initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy, after which likely only a minority of patients require further individualized treatment.
Male Rocky Mountain elk produce high-pitched bugles during the mating season, while male European red deer produce low-pitched roars. The two signal types relate differently to physical qualities of the sender. The low-frequency sound (Red Deer call) relates to overall body size via a strong relationship between acoustic parameters and the size of vocal organs and body size. The high-frequency bugle may signal muscular strength and endurance via a ‘vocalizing at the edge’ mechanism, for which efficiency is critical. We simulated the larynx and vocal tract of both species using a finite element model and a wave propagation model, based on the anatomy and biomechanics of the elk. Our results show that the high-frequency bugle requires both large muscular effort and high lung pressure, but at least 10 dB more intensity level can be achieved. The low-frequency sound (Red Deer call) relates to overall body size via a strong relationship between acoustic parameters and the size of vocal organs and body size. The two signal types relate differently to physical qualities of the sender.

 Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) is a powerful technique for large-scale profiling of transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications.  However , the first step of data analysis is to map reads to the reference genome and retain reads that map to unique locations ( uni-reads ) .  This can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads .  We describe a general approach for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome ( multi-reads ) .  Our approach is based on allocating multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme .  Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets , we illustrate that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths , leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with uni-reads , and improves detection of peaks in mappable regions .  We investigate various genome-wide characteristics of peaks detected only by utilization of multi-reads via computational experiments .  Overall , peaks from multi-read analysis have similar characteristics to peaks that are identified by uni-reads except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications .  We further validate a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identify novel target genes of GATA1 .  These computational and experimental results establish that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments .
 Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that affect the poorest populations in low- and middle-income countries. These diseases are often difficult to manage and control, and available tools are unsuitable for use in large-scale preventive control programmes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set targets for controlling or eliminating 10 NTDs by 2020. In this study, the authors estimated the economic impact of meeting these targets for four NTDs controlled or eliminated by innovative and intensified disease management (IDM): human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. The authors combined information on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments related to these NTDs with projections of the number of people suffering from each NTD, country, and year for 2011–2020 and 2021–2030. The authors found that the total global productivity gained for the four IDM-NTDs was $23.1 billion in 2011–2020 and $35.9 billion in 2021–2030. The reduction in out-of-pocket payments was $14 billion and $18 billion for the same periods. The authors faced important limitations to their work, such as finding no out-of-pocket payments for leprosy. Nevertheless, based on conservative assumptions and subsequent uncertainty analyses, the authors estimate that the benefits of achieving the targets are considerable. Under plausible scenarios, the economic benefits far exceed the necessary investments by endemic country governments and their development partners. Given the higher frequency of NTDs among the poorest households, these investments represent good value for money in the effort to improve well-being, distribute the world’s prosperity more equitably, and reduce inequity.
 Neurons in the brain respond to specific sensory inputs, and it is widely accepted that neurons with higher selectivity carry more information about external sensory inputs. However, a new study found that the neural population conveys similar information about sound input across two temporal response epochs in spite of the neuronal selectivity differences. The amount of information encoded turns out to be almost completely dependent upon the total number of population spikes in the read-out window for this system. These results imply a novel principle of sensory encoding that is potentially shared widely among multiple sensory systems.
 During acute viral infections, the pathogen is cleared by the immune system, but during chronic viral infections, the immune system needs to maintain control over the virus to prevent its spread. The co-stimulatory molecule OX40 (CD134) is important for maintaining anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections. In this study, the authors found that OX40-deficient mice failed to control LCMV clone 13 infection over time, highlighting the importance of this signaling pathway during persistent viral infection. The authors also found that OX40-deficient mice had impaired T cell dependent germinal center responses and LCMV-specific antibodies. This study provides important insights into the role of co-stimulatory signals in maintaining anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections.
 We show that the optimal specific wavelength ( OSW ) for swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla . The OSW maximizes the force generated by the body, which also maximizes swimming speed. We hypothesize a mechanical basis for this optimality and suggest reasons for its repeated emergence through evolution.
 The formation of the cerebral cortex requires precise control of cell proliferation and differentiation. During this process, neural stem cells (NSCs) divide symmetrically to generate two daughter NSCs for expanding the cell population and asymmetrically to generate pairs of a neuron and an NSC. The inheritance of chromosomes during these divisions is critical for the proper development of the cerebral cortex. Condensins are a class of multisubunit protein complexes that are thought to be central to chromosome assembly and segregation among eukaryotes. In this study, we report the first comprehensive genetic study of mammalian condensins, demonstrating that both condensin I and II are essential for NSC divisions and survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condensins leads to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, which in turn cause DNA damage and trigger p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condensins I and II lead to distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation was observed more prominently in NSCs depleted of condensin II, whereas mitotic delays were detectable only in condensin I-depleted NSCs. Remarkably, NSCs depleted of condensin II display hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating that condensin II plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture. These defects are taken over to postmitotic neurons. Our results demonstrate that condensins I and II have overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, and also provide evolutionary insight into intricate balancing acts of the two condensin complexes.
 Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The parasite has a complex life cycle that involves a free-living larval stage, a parasitic stage in the definitive host, and a sexual stage in the intermediate host. The sexual stage is characterized by the development of male and female gonads, which are differentiated based on the presence of sex chromosomes. In this study, the authors used RNA-seq to investigate the transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage- and sex-comparative manner. They found that there are significant differences in gene expression between male and female worms, particularly in the stages of development when sexual differentiation is occurring. The authors also used ChIP-Seq to investigate the epigenetic landscape of S. mansoni, and found that there are significant differences in histone modification patterns between male and female worms. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual differentiation in S. mansoni, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis.
 We propose a method for modeling disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts. Our approach allows providing each annotation with a confidence value, which is the posterior probability that it is correct. We developed two probabilistic models for performing this analysis, compared these models using computer simulation, and tested each model's actual performance based on a large data set generated by human annotators specifically for this study. We show that even in the worst-case scenario, when all annotators disagree, our approach allows us to significantly increase the probability of choosing the correct annotation. Our modeling approach is general; most data annotation studies could benefit from our methodology.
 The study aimed to develop a DNA vaccine for Andes virus (ANDV) and evaluate its efficacy in preventing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in the Syrian hamster model. The vaccine was developed using the envelope glycoproteins of ANDV and was administered to geese, which produced high-titer neutralizing antibodies after two vaccinations. The antibodies were purified from egg yolks and administered to Syrian hamsters after an ANDV challenge. The results showed that the purified antibodies protected 8 out of 8 hamsters from lethal HPS, while no protection was observed in hamsters receiving normal goose IgY/IgYΔFc or no treatment. The study highlights the potential of the DNA vaccine/goose platform for producing neutralizing antibodies that can be used to prevent HPS in humans.
 DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. The Dnmt3a enzyme is required for the establishment of normal methylation patterns and mutations in Dnmt3a have been described in leukemias. In this study, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to comprehensively characterize the methylomes from Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. Our results show that profound global methylation changes can occur in K-ras–induced lung cancer. Dnmt3a wild-type tumors were characterized by large hypomethylated domains that correspond to nuclear lamina-associated domains. In contrast, Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further data analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors show moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. In summary, our results uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes and define the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer.
30 Hz oscillations are a fundamental feature of the songbird premotor cortex HVC. In this study, we used multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging to investigate the spatial and temporal organization of HVC activity during singing. We found that HVCX projection neurons and HVC interneurons fire in alternating phases of a local 30 Hz rhythm. This suggests that there is a fundamental mesoscopic length scale and timescale in the premotor cortical area HVC. These results provide new insights into the spatiotemporal organization of HVC activity and its role in song production.
64 genes that are essential for growth and development in Caenorhabditis elegans extend lifespan when inactivated postdevelopmentally. These genes are highly conserved from yeast to humans and are involved in insulin signaling, metabolism, translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Early gene inactivations of these essential genes cause growth arrest at larval stages and some of these arrested animals live much longer than wild-type adults. These results suggest that insulin-signaling pathways play a role in regulation of aging at any stage in life.
 The ability to regenerate lost body parts is a unique feature of certain animals, such as salamanders and fish. In these animals, the process of regeneration begins with the formation of a specialized epidermis that instructs growth from the underlying stump tissue. In this study, the authors performed a genetic screen to identify mutations that impair this process in zebrafish fins. They found that a mutation in the gene encoding the extracellular matrix component laminin beta 1a (lamb1a) blocks fin regeneration. The authors showed that lamb1a is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. This event is critical for the expression of morphogenetic factors, the positioning of receptors for signaling, and the regeneration of bone. The authors also showed that fgf20a mutations or transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition disrupt lamb1a expression, linking a central growth factor to epithelial maturation during regeneration. Overall, the authors revealed that transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells is a key, growth factor-guided step in the formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis.
 In this study, we compared the performance of several linear mixed model (LMM) approaches for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3626 individuals (1972 genotyped). The implementations differ in precise details of methodology implemented and through various user-chosen options such as the method and number of SNPs used to estimate the kinship matrix. We investigated sensitivity to these choices and the success (or otherwise) of the approaches in controlling the overall genome-wide error rate in both real and simulated data. We compared the LMM results to those obtained using traditional family-based association tests (based on transmission of alleles within pedigrees) and to alternative approaches implemented in the software packages MQLS, ROADTRIPS, and MASTOR. We found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all were successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate (except for some approaches when applied naively to longitudinal data with many repeated measures). We also found high correlation between LMMs and alternative approaches (apart from transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects). We conclude that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches. Given their strong concordance, in most applications, the choice of precise LMM implementation cannot be based on power/type I error considerations but must instead be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use.
 We have developed a new whole-cell-based assay for high throughput screening of compounds that inhibit infection of mammalian cells by Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes . We screened a 2000-compound chemical library using a recombinant T . cruzi ( Tulahuen strain ) expressing β-galactosidase . Three hits were selected for their high activity against T . cruzi and low toxicity to host cells in vitro: PCH1 , NT1 and CX1 ( IC50: 54 , 190 and 23 nM , respectively ) . Each of these three compounds presents a different mechanism of action on intracellular proliferation of T . cruzi amastigotes . CX1 shows strong trypanocidal activity , an essential characteristic for the development of drugs against the chronic stage of Chagas disease where parasites are found intracellular in a quiescent stage . NT1 has a trypanostatic effect , while PCH1 affects parasite division . The three compounds also show high activity against intracellular T . cruzi from the Y strain and against the related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L . amazonensis . Characterization of the anti–T . cruzi activity of molecules chemically related to the three library hits allowed the selection of two compounds with IC50 values of 2 nM ( PCH6 and CX2 ) . These values are approximately 100 times lower than those of the medicines used in patients against T . cruzi . These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis .
 Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) is a disabling and disfiguring tropical disease caused by parasitic filarial nematodes. The current standard for monitoring infection rates is human blood sampling, but molecular xenomonitoring ( MX ) is an effective and non-invasive alternative. MX involves the detection of parasite DNA in insect vectors, such as mosquitoes. However, current MX techniques are expensive in terms of both reagents and infrastructure requirements. To address this issue, we have developed a novel diagnostic platform called "Backpack PCR" that utilizes a rapid NaOH-based DNA extraction procedure, a portable miniaturized PCR technology, and a test strip-based detection methodology. This platform is compact enough to fit into a small backpack and can be used for point-of-collection-based sample processing. The primary contribution of this work is the development of a proof-of-concept assay for the detection of Brugia malayi DNA. However, this platform can be easily adapted to detect other mosquito-borne parasites, including Wuchereria bancrofti.
 Elastomeric proteins are self-assembling molecules that provide elasticity and recoil to tissues. They are composed of alternating domains of elastomeric and cross-linking elements. Changes in the number and arrangement of these domains can significantly impact the assembly and mechanical properties of the resulting polymer. In this study, a theoretical model of diffusion-limited aggregation was used to simulate the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins with different domain architectures. The results showed that the most highly connected polymers were those constructed from asymmetric rods consisting of relatively large cross-linking elements interspersed with smaller elastomeric domains. These findings provide insights into the evolution of elastomeric proteins and may be useful for the design of new biomaterials.
Ebolaviruses are highly lethal zoonotic pathogens that possess longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due to long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ) present in the seven viral transcriptional units. The study examined the function of the 5′-UTRs of the EBOV genome and found that the 5′-UTRs differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. The L 5′-UTR strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a “weak” Kozak sequence and suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2α was phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To directly address the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the L uAUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10–100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. Cumulatively, these data identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression, demonstrate their relevance to virus replication, and identify a potential therapeutic target.
 DSBs are important for understanding both chromosomal architecture and specific chromosomal regions at DSBs . We developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSBs in human chromosomes , and observed non-random fragmentation and DSB hot spots . These hot spots are scattered along chromosomes and delimit protected 50–250 kb DNA domains . We found that about 30% of the domains ( denoted forum domains ) possess coordinately expressed genes and that PARP1 and HNRNPa2B1 specifically bind DNA sequences at the forum domain termini . Thus , our data suggest a novel type of gene regulation: a coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters delimited by DSB hot spots as well as PARP1 and HNRNPa2B1 binding sites .
 Trypanosomatids are parasites that infect plants, insects, and vertebrates. They are divided into two groups: monoxenous and heteroxenous. Monoxenous trypanosomatids are parasites that infect only one host species, while heteroxenous trypanosomatids are parasites that infect multiple host species. Trypanosoma cruzi is a heteroxenous parasite that infects humans and other mammals. It is the causative agent of Chagas disease. The study aimed to investigate the diversity of trypanosomatids in bats captured in two areas with different levels of preservation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state. The results showed that the two areas had similar bat species richness, with the most common fruit-eating bat species being Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus. Of the 181 bat specimens analyzed, 24 were infected with trypanosomatids, including one positive Sturnira lilium individual that was also positive by fresh blood examination. Molecular characterization using nested PCR targeting the 18SSU rRNA-encoding gene fragment showed similar trypanosomatid infection rates in bats from the two areas. Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite, followed by T . cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV and Trypanosoma sp . The study highlights the importance of preserving the Atlantic Forest to maintain the diversity of trypanosomatids in this sylvatic environment.
 Ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe . The Ixodes ricinus tick species is able to transmit a large number of bacteria, viruses, and parasites . Ticks may also be co-infected with several pathogens, with a subsequent high likelihood of co-transmission to humans or animals . However, few data exist regarding co-infection prevalences, and these studies only focus on certain well-known pathogens. In addition to pathogens, ticks also carry symbionts that may play important roles in tick biology and could interfere with pathogen maintenance and transmission. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and four symbionts and their co-infection levels as well as possible interactions between pathogens or between pathogens and symbionts. A total of 267 Ixodes ricinus female specimens were collected in the French Ardennes and analyzed by high-throughput real-time PCR for the presence of 37 pathogens (bacteria and parasites), by rRT-PCR to detect the presence of Tick-Borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and by nested PCR to detect four symbionts. Possible multipartite interactions between pathogens or between pathogens and symbionts were statistically evaluated. Among the infected ticks, 45% were co-infected, and carried up to five different pathogens. When adding symbiont prevalences, all ticks were infected by at least one microorganism, and up to eight microorganisms were identified in the same tick. When considering possible interactions between pathogens, the results suggested a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii, whereas there were no significant interactions between symbionts and pathogens. Our study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates in ticks, raising questions about possible co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals, and their consequences to human and animal health. We also demonstrated high prevalence rates of symbiont co-existing with pathogens, opening new avenues of enquiry regarding their effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence. , Introduction:  Ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of disease agents to humans and domestic animals in Europe . Ixodes ricinus is the most important tick in terms of human and animal health as it can attach to vertebrate hosts for up to ten days, and takes a blood meal during each of its three life stages of larva, nymph, and adult, except adult males who mate with feeding adult females . The natural hosts of I. ricinus include almost all wild or domestic animals living in woods and pasture, whereas humans become accidental hosts when entering tick habitats. Of all ticks, I. ricinus transmits the greatest variety of pathogens, including bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. spielmanii [3] , Anaplasma phagocytophilum , the spotted fever group of Rickettsia sp. , and possibly Bartonella spp. and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis…) , parasites (mainly Babesia) , and viruses (mainly tick-borne encephalitis virus) . Questing larvae can only be infected by those few pathogens capable of horizontal transmission in ticks . Thus larvae have a limited potential role as vectors of human or animal pathogens . In contrast, nymphs on the impact of tick-borne pathogens on public health is readily recognized . Indeed, questing nymphs have already been exposed to pathogens during their blood meal as larvae . They are often able to transmit pathogens , especially considering nymph bites often go unnoticed due to their tiny size , and that transmission rates increase with lengthening meal duration [4] . Questing adults can also bite humans , and are the cause of between 10 to 40% of all human tick bites in Europe [5–8] . During the larval and nymphal stages they have ingested two blood meals , both potential pathogen-acquiring occasions . Thus , they are more likely to be infected and co-infected than nymphs [7 , 9 , 10] and represent a substantial threat to the public health , especially in term of co-infections .
 The hematopoietic system is responsible for producing all types of blood cells. The decision to produce one type of cell over another is made by a network of genes that are turned on or off in a switch-like manner. The PU . 1 and GATA-1 genes are part of this network and are responsible for the decision between erythroid and myeloid lineages. The authors develop a computational model to understand how this network functions. They suggest that a cofactor, which is regulated and recruited by one of the master genes, is necessary for the network to function as a switch. The authors also discuss how this network is connected to other networks that make the final decision between erythroid and myeloid lineages. Overall, the authors provide insights into how gene networks make decisions during development.
 Enterococcus faecalis is a common opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide range of hospital-acquired infections. One of the key features of E . faecalis that contributes to its pathogenesis is its resistance to the host innate immune system, particularly to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. In this study, we used transposon mutagenesis to identify additional genes involved in E . faecalis resistance to lysozyme. We found that several genes involved in the decoration of the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen ( EPA ) contribute to resistance to lysozyme and play an essential role in virulence. Our findings suggest that the production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is not sufficient to promote E . faecalis infections and reveal an essential role of the modification of this surface polymer for enterococcal pathogenesis.
 In this study, we developed a novel two-stage regression framework called RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation) to integrate gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with regulatory data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). We applied RACER to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) data from TCGA and ENCODE to identify key regulators and their interactions. Our results show that RACER outperforms existing methods in predicting gene expression and detecting known regulatory interactions. We also identified a novel role for miR-548p in AML pathogenesis and a potential prognostic marker using the inferred activities of C-Fos. Our study demonstrates the utility of RACER in integrating heterogeneous data to gain insight into complex biological systems.
RNA silencing is a mechanism that regulates gene expression in fungi, plants, animals, and other eukaryotes. It involves the processing of dsRNA into small RNAs by Dicer-like enzymes, which are then incorporated into RISC complexes containing Argonaute proteins. These complexes bind to target RNA, leading to its degradation or translational repression. In this study, the authors generated knock-out mutants of genes encoding Dicer-like and Argonaute proteins in the fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum, a plant pathogen. They found that these mutants had severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology, and that a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus was derepressed in these mutants. The authors propose that RNA silencing functions as an antiviral defense mechanism in C. higginsianum.
γH2AX is a marker of DNA damage and is used to study meiotic prophase I in male mice. Three waves of H2AX phosphorylation have been observed in male meiotic prophase I: the first is ATM-dependent and occurs at leptonema, the second is ATR-dependent and occurs at zygonema, and the third is also ATR-dependent and occurs at pachynema. MOF is a histone acetyltransferase that is involved in all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation expansion. Germ cell-specific deletion of Mof in spermatocytes by Stra8-Cre (Mof cKO) caused global loss of H4K16ac. In leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes of Mof cKO mice, the γH2AX signals were observed only along the chromosomal axes, and chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation was lost. In almost 40% of early-mid pachytene spermatocytes from Mof cKO mice, γH2AX and MDC1 were detected along the unsynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes, but failed to expand, which consequently caused meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) failure. Though RAD51 was proficiently recruited to DSB sites, defects in DSB repair and crossover formation were observed in Mof cKO spermatocytes, indicating that MOF facilitates meiotic DSB repair after RAD51 recruitment. The authors propose that MOF regulates male meiosis and is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation from the leptotene to pachytene stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively.
 The Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is a retrovirus that causes an aggressive clonal lymphoproliferative disorder of mature CD4+ CD25+ T cells known as Adult T-cell Leukaemia ( ATL ). HTLV-1 infection is thought to occur early in life and is associated with a long latency period before the onset of ATL. In this study, the authors used a "Human Immune System" ( HIS ) mouse model to investigate the effects of HTLV-1 infection on human T-cell development. They found that HTLV-1 infection altered human T-cell development, leading to an accumulation of activated mature single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen. The authors also observed abnormalities such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lymphoma in HTLV-1-infected mice. These findings suggest that HTLV-1 infection in the thymus may be a prerequisite for the malignant lymphoproliferation associated with this retroviral infection. The HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model may be useful for studying the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1.
 Schistosomiasis is a major public health concern in Sudan, particularly S. haematobium infection. This study presents the disease-reduction outcomes of an integrated control program for schistosomiasis in Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State, Sudan from 2009 through 2011. The total population of the project sites was 482,902, and the major target group for intervention among them was 78,615 primary school students. For the cross-sectional study of the prevalence, urine and stool specimens were examined using the urine sedimentation method and the Kato cellophane thick smear method, respectively. To assess the impacts of health education for students and a drinking water supply facility at Al Hidaib village, questionnaire survey was done. The overall prevalence for S. haematobium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. At follow-up survey after 6–9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced to 13.5% (95% CI=0.331–0.462). A higher reduction in prevalence was observed among girls, those with moderately infected status (around 20%), and residents in rural areas, than among boys, those with high prevalence (>40%), and residents in urban areas. After health education, increased awareness about schistosomiasis was checked by questionnaire survey. Also, a drinking water facility was constructed at Al Hidaib village, where infection rate was reduced more compared to that in a neighboring village within the same unit. However, we found no significant change in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection between baseline and follow-up survey (95% CI=0.933–6.891). At the end of the project, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced by more than 50% in comparison with the baseline rate. Approximately 200,000 subjects had received either praziquantel therapy, health education, or supply of clean water. To consolidate the achievements of this project, the integrated intervention should be adapted continuously.
 Nipah virus ( NiV ) is a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans . The matrix protein ( M ) of NiV is a major structural protein that mediates viral assembly and budding . We found that NiV-M translocates to the nucleus at early stages of infection before subsequent localization to the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane . Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) and the leucine-rich nuclear export signal ( NES ) found in NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and also abolished NiV-M budding . A highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions: its positive charge was important for mediating nuclear import , and it was also a potential site for monoubiquitination which regulates nuclear export of the protein . Concordantly , overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding whereas depletion of free ubiquitin in the cell ( via proteasome inhibitors ) resulted in nuclear retention of NiV-M and blocked viral budding . Live Nipah virus budding was exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors: bortezomib , an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor for treating multiple myeloma , reduced viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM , which is 100-fold less than the peak plasma concentration that can be achieved in humans . This opens up the possibility of using an “off-the-shelf” therapeutic against acute NiV infection .
 Viruses initiate infection by transferring their genetic material across a cellular membrane and into the appropriate compartment of the cell. The mechanisms by which animal viruses, especially nonenveloped viruses, deliver their genomes are poorly understood. This is due in part to technical difficulties involved in direct visualization of viral gene delivery and to uncertainties in distinguishing productive and nonproductive pathways caused by the high particle-to-plaque forming unit of most animal viruses. Here, we combine an imaging assay that simultaneously tracks the viral capsid and genome in live cells with an infectivity-based assay for RNA release to characterize the early events in the poliovirus (PV) infection. We find that PV genome release is highly efficient and rapid, and thus does not limit the overall infectivity or the infection rate. We also observe that PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell by a clathrin-, caveolin-, flotillin-, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine kinase- and actin-dependent, endocytic mechanism. Immediately after the internalization of the virus particle, genome release takes place from vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations located within 100–200 nm of the plasma membrane. These results settle a long-lasting debate of whether PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. We expect this imaging assay to be broadly applicable to the investigation of entry mechanisms for nonenveloped viruses.
 Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Cambodia, particularly among children. Health education is a key component of the National Dengue Control Program, but it is not systematically evaluated, is underfunded, and is delivered irregularly. As a result, adherence to health education is partial. We suggest the need for sustained routine education for dengue prevention and control, and the need for approaches to ensure the translation of knowledge into practice.
 Filarial nematodes cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals. We investigated the presence of circulating miRNAs released by filarial nematodes into the host bloodstream. miRNA deep-sequencing combined with bioinformatics revealed over 200 mature miRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in Dirofilaria immitis-infected dog plasma in two independent analyses, and 21 in Onchocerca volvulus-infected human serum. Total RNA obtained from D . immitis-infected dog plasma was subjected to stem-loop RT-qPCR assays targeting two detected miRNA candidates, miR-71 and miR-34. Additionally, Brugia pahangi-infected dog samples were included in the analysis, as these miRNAs were previously detected in extracts prepared from this species. The presence of miR-71 and miR-34 discriminated infected samples (both species) from uninfected samples, in which no specific miRNA amplification occurred. However, absolute miRNA copy numbers were not significantly correlated with microfilaraemia for either parasite. This may be due to the imprecision of mf counts to estimate infection intensity or to miRNA contributions from the unknown number of adult worms present. Nonetheless, parasite-derived circulating miRNAs are found in plasma or serum even for those species that do not live in the bloodstream.
 We present a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain of the Src-family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which incorporates two experimental structures for the inactive and active states. We simulate the conformational transition between these two states and construct a structural network from the simulations. We identify two major pathways for the transition, one involving a coordinated switching mechanism of interactions among the αC helix, the activation-loop, and the β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain, and the other involving a partial unfolding of the N-lobe region. We also characterize the switching mechanism for the αC helix and the activation-loop in detail. Finally, we test the performance of a Markov model and its ability to account for the structural kinetics in the context of Src conformational changes. Our results provide a broad framework for understanding the main features of the conformational transition taking place upon Src activation.
 The molecular mechanisms underlying lethality of F1 hybrids between diverged parents are one target of speciation research. Crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same genotype can result in F1 lethality, and this dosage-sensitive incompatibility plays a role in polyploid speciation. We have identified variation in F1 lethality in interploidy crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana and determined the genetic architecture of the maternally expressed variation via QTL mapping. A single large-effect QTL, DR. STRANGELOVE 1 ( DSL1 ), was identified as well as two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL1. DSL1 affects the rate of postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal effect transcription factor TTG2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by both natural variation and ttg2 loss-of-function mutants. The simple genetic basis of the natural variation and effects of single-gene mutations suggests that F1 lethality in polyploids could evolve rapidly. Furthermore, the role of the sporophytically active TTG2 gene in interploidy crosses indicates that the developmental programming of the mother regulates the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring.
Bats and rodents are important reservoirs for emerging bacterial zoonoses in humans. We conducted the first comparative host–pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts, using Bartonella and Leptospira as a model. We found that Bartonella and its bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit, while Leptospira and its bat hosts lacked congruence. These results indicate that inhibitory dynamics play a central role in the generation and modulation of the alpha-rhythm in humans.
 The study investigates the relationship between muscle forcing and deformation kinematics in undulatory swimming. A chain-link model of swimming is used to understand how muscle activation leads to deformation and movement. The study shows that forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body, which in turn cause the translational motion. The study also shows that the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. The study provides a closed form expression for swimming velocity and identifies the key parameters controlling the optimal conditions for fast swimming. The study is verified by performing fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations.
 The African trypanosome T. brucei is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT). The human-infective subspecies T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr) is morphologically indistinguishable from the animal-infective subspecies T. b. brucei (Tbb). The gene SRA is responsible for human infectivity in Tbr and is located on one of the telomeric expression sites (ES) for variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes. The authors show that SRA is readily transferred between Tbr and Tbb during sexual reproduction, creating new genotypes of the human pathogen Tbr. They also show that SRA is present as a single copy on one homologue of chromosome IV in the majority of Tbr strains analyzed. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the epidemiology of HAT in East Africa.
β-cells in the islets of Langerhans are electrically coupled by gap junction channels, which play a major role in coordinating a pulsatile secretory response at elevated glucose and suppressing insulin secretion at basal glucose . Previously, we demonstrated that a critical number of inexcitable cells can rapidly suppress the overall islet response, as a result of gap junction coupling . This was demonstrated in a murine model of Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM) involving expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels, and by a multi-cellular computational model of islet electrical activity. Here we examined the mechanisms by which gap junction coupling contributes to islet dysfunction in NDM. We first verified the computational model against [Ca2+] and insulin secretion measurements in islets expressing ATP-insensitive KATP channels under different levels of gap junction coupling. We then applied this model to predict how different KATP channel mutations found in NDM suppress [Ca2+] and the role of gap junction coupling in this suppression. We further extended the model to account for stochastic noise and insulin secretion dynamics. We found experimentally and in the islet model that reductions in gap junction coupling allow progressively greater glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] and insulin secretion following expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels. The model demonstrated good correspondence between suppression of [Ca2+] and clinical presentation of different NDM mutations. Significant recoveries in [Ca2+] and insulin secretion were predicted for many mutations upon reductions in gap junction coupling, where stochastic noise played a significant role in the recoveries. These findings provide new understanding how the islet functions as a multicellular system and for the role of gap junction channels in exacerbating the effects of decreased cellular excitability. They further suggest novel therapeutic options for NDM and other monogenic forms of diabetes.
 In this paper, we introduce a framework for analyzing the dynamic behavior of gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity, a phenomenon that influences the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules. We establish three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters and from the modules' topology. Based on these matrices and on the dynamics of modules in isolation, we can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. We illustrate implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. We further provide a quantitative metric that determines how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be employed both to evaluate the extent of modularity of natural networks and to establish concrete design guidelines to minimize retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.
 The pseudoautosomal region ( PAR ) is a short region of homology between the mammalian X and Y chromosomes that has undergone rapid evolution.   A crossover in the PAR is essential for the proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in male meiosis, and PAR deletion results in male sterility.   The human PAR with the obligatory crossover has an exceptionally high male crossover rate, which is 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average.   However, the mechanism by which this obligatory crossover occurs remains unknown, as does the fine-scale positioning of crossovers across this region.   Recent research in mice has suggested that crossovers in PAR may be mediated independently of the protein PRDM9, which localises virtually all crossovers in the autosomes.   To investigate recombination in this region, we construct the most fine-scale genetic map containing directly observed crossovers to date using African-American pedigrees.   We leverage recombination rates inferred from the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium in human populations and investigate the signatures of DNA evolution due to recombination.   Further, we identify direct PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells.   Using these independent lines of evidence, we show that, in contrast with mouse, PRDM9 does localise peaks of recombination in the human PAR1.   We find that recombination is a far more rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1 than it is on the autosomes.   We also show that PAR1 hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations.   Finally, we find evidence that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots.   We anticipate that the genetic maps built and validated in this work will aid research on this vital and fascinating region of the genome.
 In this study, the authors identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2A, which lacks the N-terminal demethylase domain ( ΔN-JMJD2A ). This isoform is upregulated during myoblast differentiation into myotubes and is essential for this process. The authors used a genome-wide approach to show that ΔN-JMJD2A acts as a transcriptional co-activator for many genes induced specifically during skeletal muscle differentiation. They also demonstrated that ΔN-JMJD2A binds directly to the Myog promoter to regulate H3K9 methylation, thus allowing Myog expression and promoting myotube differentiation. This study provides new insights into the role of histone demethylases in skeletal muscle differentiation.
 Guinea worm disease ( GWD ) is a parasitic disease caused by the Dracunculus medinensis worm. It is transmitted through contaminated water sources and can lead to severe pain, disability, and even death. The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme ( GWEP ) was launched in 1986 with the goal of eradicating GWD by 2015. The GWEP has been successful in reducing the number of cases significantly, but it is still in the final stages of eradication. The cost-effectiveness of the GWEP has not been evaluated since a World Bank study in 1997. This study uses data from the GWEP to estimate the cost of the implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages. It models cost-effectiveness in the period 1986–2030. The study compares the GWEP to two alternative scenarios: doing nothing ( no intervention since 1986 ) and control ( only surveillance and outbreak response during 2016–2030 ). It reports the cost per case averted, cost per disability adjusted life year ( DALY ) averted, and cost per at-risk life year averted. The study assesses cost-effectiveness against a threshold of about one half GDP per capita ( less than US$ 500 in low income countries ). All costs are expressed in US$ of 2015. The GWEP cost an estimated US$ 11 ( 95% uncertainty interval , 4 . 70–12 . 49 ) per case averted in the period 1986–2030. The pre-certification and certification phases can cost as much as US$ 0 . 0041 and US$ 0 . 0015 per capita per year . The cost per DALY averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing is estimated at US$ 222 ( 118–372 ) in 1986–2030. The GWEP is probably more cost-effective than control by the year 2030. The GWEP is certainly more cost-effective than control if willingness to pay for one year of life lived without the risk of GWD exceeds US$ 0 . 10 . Even if economic costs are two times as high as the financial costs estimated for the period to 2020 , the GWEP will still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing. Whether the GWEP turns out to be the most cost-effective alternative in the period beyond 2015 depends on the time horizon . When framed in terms of the number of years of life lived without the risk of GWD , a case can be made more easily for finishing the end game , including certification of the absence of transmission .
 The complement system is a group of nearly 30 proteins that work together to identify and destroy foreign invaders in the body. The classical pathway is one of three complement pathways and is activated when antibodies bind to foreign substances. The first component of the classical pathway is C1, which is made up of four subunits: C1q, C1r, C1s, and C1r-subunit-associated protein (C1r-SAP). C1q recognizes and binds to the foreign substance, which activates C1r and C1s. The activated C1s then cleaves C2 and C4, which form C2a and C4b. These two components then form C3 convertases, which cleave C3 into C3b. C3b then binds to the foreign substance and activates the terminal pathway of complement, which leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex and the destruction of the foreign substance. Borrelia burgdorferi is a spirochete that causes Lyme disease and has evolved mechanisms to evade the complement system. One of these mechanisms is the production of BBK32, a protein that binds to and inhibits the initiating serine protease of the classical pathway, C1r. In this study, the authors investigated the function of BBK32 orthologues from two other species of Lyme-associated Borrelia, B. afzelii and B. garinii. They found that BAD16 from B. afzelii and BGD19 from B. garinii both had BBK32-like activities, including high-affinity binding to purified C1r protease and C1 complex, and potent inhibition of the classical complement pathway. However, BGD19 had significantly reduced in vitro complement inhibitory activities relative to BBK32 or BAD16. The authors then created a chimeric protein, BXK32-C, by combining the BBK32-C domain with the C-terminal region of BGD19. BXK32-C mimicked the properties observed for BGD19-C, suggesting that the reduced complement inhibitory activities of BGD19 were due to three residues that were identical between BBK32 and BAD16 but different in BGD19. The authors then solved the crystal structure of BBK32-C, which revealed a novel helical bundle fold. The structure also showed that the three residues targeted in the BXK32-C chimera were surface-exposed, further supporting their potential relevance in C1r binding and inhibition. The authors conclude that BBK32 orthologues from Lyme-associated Borrelia species have complement inhibitory activities and that the differences in complement inhibitory activities among these proteins are due to subtle differences in their amino acid sequences.
 The opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. Although previous gene-knockout studies have identified many factors involved in this transformation, it remains unclear how these factors are regulated to coordinate the switch. Investigating morphogenetic control by post-translational phosphorylation has generated important regulatory insights into this process, especially focusing on coordinated control by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Here we have identified the Fkh2 transcription factor as a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. In stationary phase yeast cells, 2D gel electrophoresis shows that there is a diverse pool of Fkh2 phospho-isoforms. For a short window on hyphal induction, far before START in the cell cycle, the phosphorylation profile is transformed before reverting to the yeast profile. This transformation does not occur when stationary phase cells are reinoculated into fresh medium supporting yeast growth. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1. Substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile. Transcript profiling of the phosphorylation site mutant revealed that the hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction and biofilm formation. Furthermore, we identified that Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, thereby providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. Thus, we have discovered a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.
The human pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei has both de novo and salvage routes for the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides . However, unlike humans, T . brucei lacks dCMP deaminase ( DCTD ) , which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation . Ectopic expression of human DCTD resulted in full rescue of the RNAi growth phenotype and allowed for selection of viable TK null cells . Metabolite profiling by LC-MS/MS revealed a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides in TK depleted cells . Knockout of cytidine deaminase ( CDA ) , which converts deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine led to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy . These unexpected results suggested that T . brucei encodes an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides , leading to their dead-end buildup in TK depleted cells at the expense of dTTP pools . Bioinformatics analysis identified several potential candidate genes that could encode 5’-nucleotidase activity including an HD-domain protein that we show catalyzes dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleotide 5’-monophosphates . We conclude that TK is essential for synthesis of thymine nucleotides regardless of whether the nucleoside precursors originate from the de novo pathway or through salvage . Reliance on TK in the absence of DCTD may be a shared vulnerability among trypanosomatids and may provide a unique opportunity to selectively target a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes with a single drug .
 The initiation of translation is a fundamental and highly regulated process in gene expression . In prokaryotic systems, translation initiation usually requires interaction between the ribosome and an mRNA sequence upstream of the initiation codon, the so-called ribosome-binding site ( Shine-Dalgarno sequence ). However, a large number of genes do not possess Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and it is unknown how start codon recognition occurs in these mRNAs. We have performed genome-wide searches in various groups of prokaryotes to identify sequence elements and/or RNA secondary structural motifs that could mediate translation initiation in mRNAs lacking Shine-Dalgarno sequences. We find that mRNAs without a Shine-Dalgarno sequence are generally less structured in their translation initiation region and show a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Using reporter gene constructs in bacteria, we also provide experimental support for local RNA unfoldedness determining start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno–independent translation. Consistent with this, we show that AUG start codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal AUG codons are usually in structured regions of the mRNA. Taken together, our bioinformatics analyses and experimental data suggest that local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shine-Dalgarno–independent translation. Thus, our results provide a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site.
 Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) is a skin condition that can develop after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ). PKDL is infrequent in patients treated with liposomal amphotericin B ( Ambisome ) . In a study of 8749 patients treated with Ambisome for VL in India, 24 patients developed PKDL over a 5-year period. The majority of these patients had macular lesions and the median time to development of symptoms was 1.2 years after treatment. There were no significant risk factors for PKDL in this study. The shorter median time to developing symptoms of PKDL compared with that after conventional VL treatments should be taken into account when counseling patients treated with regimens including Ambisome.
 Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by the blood-sucking insect Triatoma infestans. In northwest Argentina, T. infestans has reinfested some villages after community-wide insecticide spraying in October 1992. To understand the dynamics of reinfestation, we analyzed longitudinal data on T. infestans populations in three villages. We found that more new bug populations become established from May to November than from November to May, which coincides with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. In the fitted models, the probability of new bug establishment increases with increasing time since last detected infestation. These effects of season and previous infestation on bug establishment challenge our current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight important gaps in knowledge. Experiments are necessary to close these gaps and develop an optimal spraying strategy.
 Polyomaviruses are small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that can cause cancer in humans. The Polyomaviridae family contains several viral species that can infect humans, including SV40. SV40 is the type species of the virus family and is a model cancer virus. Syrian golden hamsters are the small animal model for studies of SV40. In this study, we report the effects of SV40 microRNA on the pathogenesis of viral infections in vivo. We found that SV40 had a broad tissue tropism, with infected tissues including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. We also found that SV40 microRNA was expressed in wild-type SV40-infected tissues. MicroRNA-negative mutant viruses consistently produced higher viral DNA loads than wild-type SV40 in both liver and kidney. We also found that viruses with complex regulatory regions displayed modestly higher viral DNA loads in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions. Finally, we found that early viral transcripts were detected at higher levels than late transcripts in liver and kidney. Our findings provide the first evidence of expression and function of SV40 microRNA in vivo.
 Positive selection is a major force in shaping the evolution of genomes. Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes ( PSGs ) have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of differences between species and the functions of individual genes. However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy due to small numbers of available genomes. Here, we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using six high-coverage genome assemblies for eutherian mammals. Our analyses revealed 400 genes with strong evidence of positive selection, according to a standard likelihood ratio test. We also identified 144 genes that showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. The identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also for more specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible “selection histories” of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.
 Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterial pathogen that causes a wide range of infections in humans. Biofilms, which are communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are surrounded by a protective matrix, are often associated with chronic S . aureus infections. In this study, the authors discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S . aureus biofilm integrity. These fibers are composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins ( PSMs ) and have amyloid-like properties. Mutants unable to produce PSMs were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Previous work has associated PSMs with biofilm disassembly, and the authors present data showing that soluble PSM peptides disperse biofilms while polymerized peptides do not. This work suggests that PSMs' aggregation into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms.
 Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It affects about six million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. The aim of this study was to evaluate a newly developed antibody profiling assay as an indirect method to assess parasite persistence based on waning of antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection. The study found that a specific antibody response ( antibody 3 ) strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. The study suggests that antibody 3 is induced and maintained by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based and shed parasites that are not consistently detectable by blood-based PCR techniques. The study suggests that a simple immunoassay measurement of antibody 3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes acute and chronic joint pain in humans. The mechanisms of chronic joint pain are not well understood, but it is thought to be due to persistent infection of joint-associated cells. To identify the cells that contribute to chronic CHIKV infection, we developed a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase. This virus infected and replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts, and induced acute arthritis in mice. Importantly, it also established chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and chronic joint pain similar to wild-type virus. We used this virus to mark cells that survive CHIKV infection in vivo and are enriched for persistent viral RNA. This model provides a powerful tool to study CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.
 We used factor analysis ( FA ) to study the multi-dimensional structure of neural population activity in the visual cortex of non-human primates and in spiking network models. We found that the scaling properties of shared dimensionality and percent shared variance differed between networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity. Furthermore , recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify dominant modes of shared variability that generalized to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.
2-aminoacetophenone ( 2-AA ) is a quorum sensing molecule produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chronic infections in humans. In this study, the authors investigated the immunomodulatory effects of 2-AA on host immune responses. They found that 2-AA pretreatment of mice prior to infection with P. aeruginosa led to a 90% survival rate compared to a 10% survival rate in non-pretreated mice. This was due to the activation of key innate immune response pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ), nuclear factor ( NF ) -κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, upon 2-AA pretreatment, immune response activation was attenuated, most likely by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. The authors propose that 2-AA's ability to signal bacteria to switch to a chronic infection mode while enabling host tolerance to infection may be a key factor in the persistence of P. aeruginosa infections.
 The human genome contains many active and fossilized retroelements, which are selfish genetic elements that can insert themselves into host genomes. Some of these retroelements have been domesticated by host genomes for their own purposes, leading to important innovations in genome defense and placentation. One such domesticated gene is L1TD1, which is almost entirely derived from a LINE-1 (L1) retroelement. L1TD1 is important for pluripotency maintenance in human embryonic stem cells and has been shown to be under positive selection during primate and mouse evolution. However, L1TD1 has been lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution, and its loss is associated with L1 extinction in several megabat lineages. The authors hypothesize that L1TD1 could have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements, and later became incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. Overall, the study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology and the potential for such domesticated genes to adopt different functions in different lineages.
YbeY is a highly conserved protein found in many bacteria, including E. coli and Vibrio cholerae. It is an endoribonuclease that plays a key role in processing the 3′ end of 16S rRNA and in ribosome quality control. In this study, the authors show that YbeY is essential for virulence in V. cholerae and that it is part of a small set of RNases that are essential in most representative pathogens. They also show that YbeY is crucial for 16S rRNA 3′ end maturation and 70S ribosome assembly. The authors experimentally identified several YbeY- and RNase E:ΔCTD-dependent sRNAs associated with V. cholerae virulence. Finally, they demonstrate the high conservation of YbeY activity across species.
 Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind DNA to regulate gene expression. They form a transcription factor network (TFN) when they regulate each other's expression. The topology of TFNs has been studied extensively, and it has been shown that the degree distribution of TFNs is heavy-tailed, meaning that a few TFs have many targets while many TFs have few targets. This heavy-tailed degree distribution confers robustness to TFNs against genetic perturbations. However, the degree assortativity of TFNs, which measures the tendency of TFs with similar numbers of targets to connect, has not been well characterized. In this study, we use publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the degree assortativity of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. We find that all TFNs share a common degree assortativity signature, which confers robustness to model TFNs against genetic perturbations. Lastly, we determine the extent to which each of the four components of the degree assortativity signature contributes to this robustness.
 The neocortex is a complex network of neurons that processes sensory information. In this study, researchers recorded the activity of neurons in the somatosensory barrel cortex of anesthetized rats using large-scale multi-electrode arrays. They found that inhibitory neurons, which are a minority of the neurons in the neocortex, encode sensory information more efficiently than excitatory neurons. This suggests that inhibitory neurons play a crucial role in processing sensory information in the neocortex.

5′-nucleotidase II ( cN-II ) is a cytosolic enzyme that regulates intracellular nucleotide pools by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. High cN-II expression is correlated with abnormal patient outcome when treated with cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. To identify its specific role in the resistance phenomenon observed during cancer therapy, we screened a particular class of chemical compounds, namely ribonucleoside phosphonates, to predict them as potential cN-II inhibitors. Six compounds were predicted as better ligands than the natural substrate of cN-II, inosine 5′-monophosphate ( IMP ). The study of purine and pyrimidine containing analogues and the introduction of chemical modifications within the phosphonate chain has allowed us to define general rules governing the theoretical affinity of such ligands. The binding strength of these compounds was scrutinized in silico and explained by an impressive number of van der Waals contacts, highlighting the decisive role of three cN-II residues. Docking predictions were confirmed by experimental measurements of the nucleotidase activity in the presence of the three best available phosphonate analogues. These compounds were shown to induce a total inhibition of the cN-II activity at 2 mM. Altogether, this study emphasizes the importance of the non-hydrolysable phosphonate bond in the design of new competitive cN-II inhibitors and the crucial hydrophobic stacking promoted by three protein residues.
 Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and animals. The key event in prion diseases is the conversion of a normal cellular protein into an abnormal isoform. Prion diseases have been reported in sheep, cattle, and humans. Infectivity has been reported in the absence of detectable abnormal PrP. A recent study found evidence of prion disease in mammary secretions from scrapie-affected ewes. The study also found that prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum from ewes with and without mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles. The highest per ml infectious titre was found to be equivalent to that contained in 6 µg of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. These findings suggest that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating prion disease could contribute to the animal prion transmission process. The study raises some concern with regard to the risk to humans of prion exposure associated with milk products from ovine and other prion-susceptible dairy species.
 Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) is a severe infection in humans caused by the Ebola virus. The outbreak of EVD in Liberia began in March 2014 and ended in January 2016. During the outbreak, epidemiological information on suspected, probable, and confirmed EVD cases was collected and managed nationally. However, surveillance and reporting systems malfunctioned during the outbreak, resulting in inadequate data management. EVD diagnostic laboratories were able to register basic demographic and clinical information of patients more systematically. Here, we present data on 16,370 laboratory samples that were tested between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015. A total of 10,536 traceable individuals were identified, of whom 3,897 were confirmed cases (positive for Ebola virus RNA). There were significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Age (young children and the elderly) and place of residence (rural areas) were the risk factors for death due to the disease. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. These findings may help support future investigations and lead to a fuller understanding of the outbreak in Liberia.
 Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phenol to the corresponding ortho-quinone. The Streptomyces tyrosinase is generated as a complex with a “caddie” protein that facilitates the transport of two copper ions into the active center. In our previous study, the Tyr98 residue in the caddie protein was found to be converted to a reactive quinone through the formations of the μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper (II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone intermediates. In the present study, we determined the cryo-trapped crystal structures of the S. castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase at very high resolutions (1.16–1.70 Å). The structures suggest the existence of an important step for the tyrosinase reaction that has not yet been found: the hydroxylation reaction is triggered by the movement of CuA, which induces the syn-to-anti rearrangement of the copper ligands after the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper (II) core. By the rearrangement, the hydroxyl group of the substrate is placed in an equatorial position, allowing the electrophilic attack to the aromatic ring by the Cu2O2 oxidant. Our study provides a clearer understanding of the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase.
The early stages of ribosome biogenesis are not well understood. We have identified a complex of four assembly factors ( AFs ) that associate with the Dbp6p helicase, which is essential for the normal accumulation of the first pre-60S particle in yeast. We have shown that Npa1p forms the backbone of the complex and is essential for the insertion of Dbp6p within 90S pre-ribosomal particles. We have also mapped Npa1p rRNA binding sites on 25S rRNA adjacent to the root helices of the first and last secondary structure domains of 25S rRNA. Our data suggest that the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions.
The ability to adapt to a changing world is essential for survival. To do this, we need to update our beliefs about the world based on new information. In this study, we investigated how the brain regulates the rate at which we update our beliefs. We found that the brain chemicals norepinephrine and dopamine play a key role in this process. Specifically, we found that the amount of these chemicals released in the brain after a surprising event is related to how quickly we update our beliefs. We also found that the amount of these chemicals released in the brain is related to how much we pay attention to new information. These findings provide important insights into how the brain regulates learning and adaptation in a changing world.
 Infectious diseases are still a major challenge for humanity . In this context, their surveillance is critical. From 2010 to 2016, two Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories were successfully implemented in the rural Saloum region of Senegal. In parallel, a homemade syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data produced by the POC laboratory of the Timone hospital in Marseille, France. The aim of this study is to describe the steps necessary for implementing EPIMIC using data routinely produced by two POC laboratories established in rural Senegal villages. After improving EPIMIC, we started to monitor the 15 pathogens routinely diagnosed in the two POC-L using the same methodology we used in France. In 5 years, 2,577 deduplicated patients-samples couples from 775 different patients have been tested in the Dielmo and Ndiop POC-L. 739 deduplicated patients-samples couples were found to be positive to at least one of the tested pathogens. The retrospective analysis of the Dielmo and Ndiop POC data with EPIMIC allowed to generate 443 alarms. Since January 2016, 316 deduplicated patients-samples couples collected from 298 different patients were processed in the Niakhar POC laboratory. 56 deduplicated patients-samples couples were found to be positive to at least one of the tested pathogens. The retrospective analysis of the data of the Niakhar POC laboratory with EPIMIC allowed to generate 14 alarms. Although some improvements are still needed, EPIMIC has been successfully spread using data routinely produced by two rural POC-L in Senegal, West Africa.
 The calcium ion is a universal second messenger that regulates a wide range of cell functions. In this study, the authors investigated the roles of structural arrangement of endothelial cells in collective calcium signaling and cell contractility. Using a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning, the authors found that endothelial cells in self-assembled and microengineered networks exhibit calcium oscillations in response to histamine stimulation, while individual cells and monolayers do not. Micropatterning, pharmacological inhibition, and computational modeling revealed that the calcium oscillation depends on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication, providing a mechanistic basis of the architecture-dependent calcium signaling. Furthermore, the calcium oscillation attenuates the histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential cell responses in an architecture-dependent manner. Taken together, the results suggest that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling.
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. In a previous study, we identified the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection in infants. In the current study, we examined the contribution of antigenic regions of RSV G protein outside of the central conserved domain (CCD) to RSV-specific immunity. We evaluated the immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy of all RSV-G antigenic sites identified following primary RSV infection using recombinant E. coli expressed G ectodomain (REG), CCD-deleted G ectodomain (REG ΔCCD), N- and C-terminal G subdomains, and antigenic site peptides. The REG ΔCCD, N- and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound fully glycosylated Recombinant Mammalian expressed G ectodomain (RMG) and intact RSV virion particles but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared with the intact G ectodomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A2 Line 19F. Viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was significantly reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmunized controls. Control of viral loads post-RSV challenge correlated with serum antibody binding to the virus particles. In addition, very low Th2/Th1 cytokine ratios were found in the lungs of REG ΔCCD vaccinated mice after challenge. These data demonstrate the presence of multiple protective sites in RSV G protein outside of the CCD that could contribute to the development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein as safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease.
 In this study, we focused on the role of RNA processing during target-derived signaling in the specification of Drosophila FMRFamide neurons, the Tv4 neurons of the ventral nerve cord. We found that two genes encoding components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, brr2 and Prp8, play crucial roles in controlling the expression of the FMRFa neuropeptide specifically in six neurons of the VNC (Tv4 neurons). Detailed analysis of brr2 revealed that this control is executed by two independent mechanisms, both of which are required for the activation of the BMP retrograde signaling pathway in Tv4 neurons: (1) proper axonal pathfinding to the target tissue in order to receive the BMP ligand and (2) proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway: the thickveins (tkv) gene, encoding a BMP receptor subunit, and the Medea gene, encoding a co-Smad. These results reveal involvement of specific RNA processing in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.
 The study of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) is important because they are involved in many cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle progression. The SCF ubiquitin ligase is a type of CRL that is composed of four subunits: Cdc53, Skp1, Rbx1, and one of the multiple F-box proteins. F-box proteins are relatively unstable and are important for the dynamic assembly of a diverse repertoire of SCF complexes within the cell. The study of F-box protein regulation is important because variation in their abundance has been linked to cancer. The autocatalytic F-box protein degradation pathway is thought to be suppressed by substrate binding, resulting in coordination of substrate availability with abundance of the corresponding assembled SCF complex. However, additional degradation pathways for F-box proteins are likely, as it is also important to restrict abundance of unbound F-box proteins to prevent substrate shielding effects that would compete with substrate recognition by fully assembled ligases. In this study, the authors describe an additional pathway for regulation of F-box proteins on the example of yeast Met30. This pathway is independent of Skp1 and involves the cullin component Cdc53/Cul1. The authors demonstrate that this pathway is critical for chromosome stability and effective defense against heavy metal stress. They also assign important biological functions to a sub-complex of cullin-RING ligases that comprises Cdc53/Rbx1/Cdc34, but is independent of Skp1.
 Kinesin motors are responsible for transporting cargo along microtubules in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, kinesin motors are kept inactive to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis and motility. Two models have been proposed for how activity is suppressed in the absence of cargo: autoinhibition and cargo-induced dimerization. Autoinhibition involves a folded state that enables the motor's own tail domain to interact with and inhibit its motor domain. Cargo-induced dimerization involves a monomeric motor that is activated by cargo binding and dimerization. In this study, we have examined the activity and dimerization state of KIF1A, a kinesin-3 motor involved in synaptic vesicle transport. We found that both native and expressed KIF1A proteins are dimeric in the inactive state, suggesting that KIF1A motors are autoinhibited. We also found that KIF1A motors undergo processive, ATP-driven motility only when they are dimeric. Our findings support the autoinhibition model for KIF1A motors and suggest that dimerization is required for their activity.
 Tomato is an important crop worldwide, and its fruit is a valuable source of nutrients. The fruit contains a variety of metabolites, including flavonoids, carotenoids, fibers, vitamins, and essential amino acids. The domestication of tomato has led to a loss of genetic variability, which is why researchers are now using natural variation to reintroduce lost traits into cultivated species. To do this, they have generated mapping populations, which have led to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with various traits, including fruit quality and plant-specific organ relations. In this study, researchers used a collection of 76 introgression lines (ILs) in tomato to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism and the degree of metabolic natural variability. They found 30 mQTL associated with seed metabolites and identified six exceptionally highly co-regulated amino acids. They also found that the seed metabolic network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than the fruit metabolic network. The study highlights the added value of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping and emphasizes the centrality of the amino acid module in the seed metabolic network.
 Vibrio cholerae is a bacterial pathogen that causes diarrhea in humans and colonizes the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract . The N-acetylglucosamine binding protein ( GbpA ) mediates bacterial attachment to both marine chitin and mammalian intestinal mucin through an unknown molecular mechanism . We report structural studies that reveal that GbpA possesses an unusual, elongated four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A glycan screen revealed that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides. Structure-guided GbpA truncation mutants show that domains 1 and 4 of GbpA interact with chitin in vitro, whereas in vivo complementation studies reveal that domain 1 is also crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial binding studies show that domains 2 and 3 bind to the V . cholerae surface. Finally, mouse virulence assays show that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization. These results explain how GbpA provides structural/functional modular interactions between V . cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons.
 Tuberculosis ( TB ) is a bacterial infection that affects the lungs and other parts of the body. It is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) and is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. TB is a major global health problem, with an estimated 10 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths each year.  T cells are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the immune response to TB. There are two main types of T cells: helper T cells ( Th ) and regulatory T cells ( Treg ). Th cells help to activate other immune cells, while Treg cells help to suppress the immune response.  In this study, the authors investigated the role of Treg cells in the immune response to TB. They found that Treg cells from people with active TB were able to suppress the proliferation of Th cells, but that this suppression was less effective than in healthy controls. The authors also found that the Th cells from people with active TB were more resistant to suppression by Treg cells than those from healthy controls.  The authors used a technique called RNA sequencing to investigate the mechanisms behind this resistance. They found that the Th cells from people with active TB were expressing higher levels of certain genes that are involved in the immune response. They also found that the Treg cells from people with active TB were expressing lower levels of certain genes that are involved in suppressing the immune response.  Overall, the authors' findings suggest that the immune response to TB is more complex than previously thought, and that Treg cells play an important role in regulating this response. Their findings could help to inform the development of new treatments for TB.
 Prion diseases are caused by the conversion of a host protein, PrPC, into a misfolded form, PrPSc. PrPSc accumulates in the brain and causes neurodegeneration. PrPC is attached to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Mice expressing PrPC without a GPI anchor (tgGPI- mice) are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate anchorless PrPSc extra- rather than intracellularly. We investigated whether tgGPI- mice could faithfully propagate prion strains despite the deviant structure and location of anchorless PrPSc. We found that RML and ME7 prions propagated in tgGPI- brain developed novel cell tropisms, as determined by the Cell Panel Assay (CPA). Surprisingly, the levels of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc (PrPres) in RML- or ME7-infected tgGPI- brain were 25–50 times higher than in wild-type brain. When returned to wild-type brain, ME7 prions recovered their original properties, however RML prions had given rise to a novel prion strain, designated SFL, which remained unchanged even after three passages in wild-type mice. Because both RML PrPSc and SFL PrPSc are stably propagated in wild-type mice, we propose that the two conformations are separated by a high activation energy barrier which is abrogated in tgGPI- mice.
 BMP signaling is a conserved process that helps pattern the dorsal-ventral axis during embryonic development. In Drosophila, BMP signaling is transduced by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. In this study, we used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to identify BMP target genes and their regulatory networks during dorsal ectoderm differentiation. We found that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription. We also identified key roles for Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain, and found widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Our findings suggest that the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property in that it establishes a balance between its activity and that of the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning.
 In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major are increasing and spreading from the south-west to new areas in the center. To improve our current knowledge on L . major evolution and population dynamics, we performed multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic ( Gafsa , Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid governorates ) and collected during two periods: 1991–1992 and 2008–2012. Our analysis ( F-statistics and Bayesian model-based approach ) of the genotyping results of isolates collected in Sidi Bouzid in 1991–1992 and 2008–2012 shows that, over two decades, in the same area, Leishmania parasites evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 2008–2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L . major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, according to a geographical gradient, suggesting that human activities might be the source of the disease expansion. The genotype analysis also suggests previous ( Bayesian model-based approach ) and current ( F-statistics ) flows of genotypes between governorates and districts. Human activities as well as reservoir dynamics and the effects of environmental changes could explain how the disease progresses. This study provides new insights into the evolution and spread of L . major in Tunisia that might improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
 Helminth infections are a major public health problem, particularly in low-income communities. Mass drug administration (MDA) is the recommended strategy for controlling helminth infections, but it is not always effective. WASH interventions, such as improved sanitation and hygiene practices, may also be important for reducing helminth transmission. In this study, we evaluated the impact of different potential helminth protective packages on infection prevalence, including repeated treatment with albendazole and praziquantel with and without WASH access. We found that WASH interventions, such as safe flooring and latrine access, were associated with a significant reduction in helminth prevalence in adults who were not treated with chemotherapy. However, WASH interventions did not significantly reduce infection prevalence in adults who were treated with chemotherapy. These findings suggest that WASH interventions may be an important component of helminth control programs, particularly in areas where chemotherapy is not effective.
 Lectin-like bacteriotoxic proteins ( LlpABW ) are produced by some plant-associated bacteria and have the ability to selectively kill closely related species, including several phytopathogens . The crystal structure of LlpABW reveals an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin ( MMBL ) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain adopts a fold very similar to MMBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides. Mutational analysis indicates that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal MMBL domain adopts the same fold but is structurally more divergent and lacks a functional mannose-binding site. Differential activity of engineered N/C-domain chimers derived from two LlpA homologues with different killing spectra disclosed that the N-domain determines target specificity. Apparently this bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity.
σG is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the late stages of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis . Its activity requires eight mother-cell proteins encoded in the spoIIIA operon and the forespore protein SpoIIQ . Several of the SpoIIIA proteins share similarity with components of specialized secretion systems . One of them resembles a secretion ATPase and we demonstrate that the ATPase motifs are required for σG activity . We further show that the SpoIIIA proteins and SpoIIQ reside in a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore . Finally , we have discovered that these proteins are all required to maintain forespore integrity . In their absence , the forespore develops large invaginations and collapses . Importantly , maintenance of forespore integrity does not require σG . These results support a model in which the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ proteins form a novel secretion apparatus that allows the mother cell to nurture the forespore , thereby maintaining forespore physiology and σG activity during spore maturation .
 Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental illness that affects about 1% of the population. It is highly heritable, but the genetic variants associated with BD have been challenging to identify. In this study, we analyzed genotype data for 1,190 cases and 401 controls and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) including additional samples for a total of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. We did not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci; however, we found an association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous GWAS and evidence for replication (P=1.5×10−7). To demonstrate that this result is not likely to be a false positive, we analyzed replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and showed that, in a large enough study, associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibited a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of replicable associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies and provide a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies.
 Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and understanding the determinants of cancer proliferation is an important task for both biological and clinical research. In this study, the authors used gene expression data and growth rate measurements from 60 cancer cell lines to identify genes and cellular processes associated with cancer proliferation. They found that genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production were positively associated with cancer proliferation, while genes involved in cellular migration were negatively associated. They also found that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, while non-cancerous proliferation does not. By combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures, the authors were able to enhance the prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer. Overall, these results highlight the importance of understanding the unique determinants of cancer proliferation for the development of new cancer therapies.
11 patients with cystic echinococcosis (CE) affecting the heart and/or vena cava were studied over a period of 15 years. The main clinical manifestations were thoracic pain or dyspnea, although 2 patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment. One patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination. Two patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. One patient was lost to follow-up. Patients who had cardiac involvement exclusively did not have complications after surgery and were considered cured. There was only one recurrence requiring a second operation. Patients with vena cava involvement developed pulmonary embolism and presented multiple complications. Cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications. Clinical manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated cardiac CE may be cured after surgery, while endovascular extracardiac involvement is associated with severe chronic complications. CE should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas.
 The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microbial pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune response and are characterized by the presence of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. A bacterial TIR homologue, TirS, has been identified in Staphylococcus aureus. TirS inhibits TLR signaling and attenuates host inflammatory responses during infection. TirS is spread among 12% of MRSA and MSSA strains and is located within the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) element. Sub-inhibitory concentration of fusidic acid induces overexpression of tirS. Our results suggest that TirS may contribute to the ability of S. aureus to survive and establish a critical population size.
 The evolution of complex traits is often driven by changes in gene expression patterns. In this study, we used transcriptional datasets from fruit flies and mosquitoes to identify whole-genome changes in gene expression that underlie differences in their respective embryonic morphologies. We found that many orthologous gene pairs could be clustered based on the presence of coincident discordances in their temporal expression profiles. One such cluster contained genes expressed specifically in the mosquito serosa, which is redeployed later in development at the time of cuticle synthesis. We also found a striking difference in the temporal expression of a subset of maternal genes. Specifically, maternal transcripts that exhibit a sharp reduction at the time of the maternal-zygotic transition in Drosophila display sustained expression in the Anopheles embryo. We propose that gene clustering by local temporal discordance can be used for the de novo identification of the gene batteries underlying morphological diversity.
 Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue are the main causes of leg ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific Region . In this study, we investigated the presence of DNA from these bacteria on asymptomatic people, flies, and household linens in an endemic setting. We performed a cross-sectional study in rural villages of Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea during a yaws elimination campaign. Participants were asymptomatic subjects recruited from households with cases of leg ulcers and from households without cases of leg ulcers. We rubbed swabs on the intact skin of the leg of asymptomatic individuals and collected flies and swabs of environmental surfaces. All specimens were tested by PCR for H. ducreyi and T. p. pertenue DNA. Of 78 asymptomatic participants that had an adequate specimen for DNA detection, H. ducreyi-PCR positivity was identified in 16 (21%) and T. p. pertenue-PCR positivity in 1 (1%). In subgroup analyses, H. ducreyi-PCR positivity did not differ in participants exposed or not exposed to a case of H. ducreyi ulcer in the household (24% vs 18%; p = 0.76). Of 17 cultures obtained from asymptomatic participants, 2 (12%) yielded a definitive diagnosis of H. ducreyi, proving skin colonization. Of 10 flies tested, 9 (90%) had H. ducreyi DNA and 5 (50%) had T. p. pertenue DNA. Of 6 bed sheets sampled, 2 (33%) had H. ducreyi DNA and 1 (17%) had T. p. pertenue DNA. This is the first time that H. ducreyi DNA and colonization has been demonstrated on the skin of asymptomatic children and that H. ducreyi DNA and T. p. pertenue DNA has been identified in flies and on fomites. The ubiquity of H. ducreyi in the environment is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism.
 The International Society of Computational Biology ( ISCB ) Education Committee has developed a set of core competencies for bioinformatics training that can be applied to a wide range of users and training programs. These competencies have been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement and are intended to provide a framework for training needs and curricula. The competencies are being applied in diverse training contexts, including in-depth training for bioinformatics engineers and basic training for bioinformatics users. The use cases presented in this report demonstrate how the competencies can be applied in different training contexts and how others can make use of them. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans.
 The infectious form of many parasitic nematodes afflicts over one billion people globally and causes significant morbidity. The parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis differs from other nematode species that infect humans in that its life cycle includes both parasitic and free-living forms, which can be leveraged to investigate the mechanisms of L3i arrest and activation. We hypothesized that homologous pathways are present in S . stercoralis, have similar developmental regulation, and are involved in L3i development. To test this, we undertook a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome, generating over 2 . 3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages. We constructed developmental expression profiles for S . stercoralis homologs of C . elegans dauer genes identified by BLAST searches of the S . stercoralis genome as well as de novo assembled transcripts. Intriguingly, genes encoding cGMP pathway components were coordinately up-regulated in L3i. In comparison to C . elegans, S . stercoralis has a paucity of genes encoding IIS ligands, several of which have abundance profiles suggesting involvement in L3i development. We also identified seven S . stercoralis genes encoding homologs of the single C . elegans dauer regulatory TGFβ ligand, three of which are only expressed in L3i. Putative DA biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3i development. Our data suggest that while dauer pathway genes are present in S . stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species. Understanding the mechanisms governing L3i development may lead to novel treatment and control strategies.
 Bacterial genotoxins are known to cause DNA damage in humans, leading to digestive cancers. In this study, the authors investigated the effects of these genotoxins on nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival. They used a variety of methods, including coculture experiments with CDT- and colibactin-secreting bacteria, hepatic, intestinal, and gastric cells, and xenograft mouse-derived models. Their results showed that CDT and colibactin induced nuclear remodeling, which was associated with the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells. These structures, observed both in vivo and in vitro, correspond to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The core of the NR was found to concentrate ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the complex mCRD involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with a high degree of ploidy, and involve MAPK and calcium signaling. The authors suggest that bacterial genotoxins-induced NR would be a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be preferentially transported therein for local translation. These findings offer new insights into the context of NR formation, a common feature of many cancers, which not only appears in response to therapies-induced DNA damage but also earlier in response to genotoxic bacteria.
3D-CT images of the maxilla were reconstructed using multiplanar reconstruction methods in former patients with leprosy and control subjects. The anterior-posterior length of the maxilla was then measured. Three former patients with lepromatous leprosy showed marked atrophy of the maxilla at the prosthion which corresponded with the visual appearance of the maxillary deformity. These findings were consistent with paleopathological findings of excavated skeletal remains. The precise bone defects of the maxilla could be individually calculated for accurate reconstructive surgery. This study successfully illustrated maxillary bone deformities in living patients with leprosy and confirmed the maxillary regression described in paleopathological studies.
 The auditory system must build noise-invariant representations of sounds to accurately recognize them in a noisy environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 The interactome is a network of all the interactions between proteins in a cell. We used gene expression data to calculate changes in the interactome of yeast cells after heat shock. We found that heat shock caused a decrease in the overlaps and connections of interactome modules, and an increase in the weighted diameter of the interactome. This change in structure resembles a transition from a stratus-like to a cumulus-like organization. Our results suggest that this change in interactome structure may be a general adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
 Chagas disease is a neglected chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, with high prevalence and burden in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, and amiodarone has been widely used for this purpose. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of amiodarone in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS up to January 2018. Overall quality of evidence was accessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We included 9 studies (3 before-after studies, 5 case series and 1 randomized controlled trial) with 119 patients. In 24-hour Holter, amiodarone reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes in 99.9% (95%CI 99.8%-100%), ventricular premature beats in 93.1% (95%CI 82%-97.4%), and the incidence of ventricular couplets in 79% (RR 0.21, 95%CI 0.11-0.39). Studies not included in the IPD analysis showed a reduction of ventricular premature beats (5 studies), ventricular tachycardia (6 studies) and ventricular couplets (1 study). We pooled the incidence of adverse side effects with random effects meta-analysis; amiodarone was associated with corneal microdeposits (61.1%, 95%CI 19.0%-91.3%, 5 studies), gastrointestinal events (16.1%, 95%CI 6.61%-34.2%, 3 studies), sinus bradycardia (12.7%, 95%CI 3.71%-35.5%, 6 studies), dermatological events (10.6%, 95%CI 4.77%-21.9%, 3 studies) and drug discontinuation (7.68%, 95%CI 4.17%-13.7%, 5 studies). Quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Amiodarone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias, but there is no evidence for hard endpoints (sudden death, hospitalization). Although our findings support the use of amiodarone, it is important to balance the potential benefits and harms at the individual level for decision-making.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection that affects millions of people worldwide. The seasonality of dengue fever is influenced by a combination of climatic and environmental factors, as well as human behavioral trends. In this study, we analyzed dengue fever cases from two hospitals in rural Ecuador over a 7-year period to determine the seasonality of the disease. We found that dengue fever cases peaked in March, which is the end of the rainy season in Ecuador. We also found that the day of the week and public holidays had a significant impact on dengue fever diagnoses. Our study provides important information for public health planning and disease prevention efforts in Ecuador.
 The innate immune system is the first line of defense against viral infections. However, it can also cause autoimmune diseases if activated inappropriately. In this study, the authors show that transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) can profoundly reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity by exposing the normally membrane-sequestered RdRP activity to sustained innate immune detection. RdRP-transgenic mice have life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and show profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. Multiple crosses with defined knockout mice established that the mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS and is fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated the key features with striking fidelity. The authors suggest that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. These results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection.
 The effective population size ( Ne ) of a virus is a key factor in determining its evolutionary dynamics. However, estimates of Ne for different plant viruses have rendered diverging results. The independent action hypothesis ( IAH ) states that each virion has a probability of infection and that virions act independent of one another during the infection process. We performed a test of IAH for a plant RNA virus, Tobacco etch virus ( TEV ), using Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants. We found that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and was similar to a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary infection foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency ( <2% ). The probability that a genotype that infected the inoculated leaf would systemically infect that plant was near 1, although in a few rare cases genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by being physically surrounded by the other genotype. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted from the mean number of virions causing systemic infection using the independent-action model. Independent action appears to hold for TEV, and Ne is therefore dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The mean number of virions causing systemic infection can be very small, and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose-dependency in TEV suggests that comparison of Ne estimates for different viruses are not very meaningful unless dose effects are taken into consideration.
 The majority of expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL ) studies have been carried out in single tissues or cell types, using methods that ignore information shared across tissues. Although global analysis of RNA expression in multiple tissues is now feasible, few integrated statistical frameworks for joint analysis of gene expression across tissues combined with simultaneous analysis of multiple genetic variants have been developed to date. Here, we propose Sparse Bayesian Regression models for mapping eQTLs within individual tissues and simultaneously across tissues. Testing these on a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues, we demonstrate that our methods are more powerful than traditional approaches in revealing the true complexity of the eQTL landscape at the systems-level. Highlighting the power of our method, we identified a two-eQTL model ( cis/trans ) for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and was not detected by conventional approaches. We showed common genetic regulation of gene expression across four tissues for ∼27% of transcripts, providing >5 fold increase in eQTLs detection when compared with single tissue analyses at 5% FDR level. These findings provide a new opportunity to uncover complex genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling global gene expression while the generality of our modelling approach makes it adaptable to other model systems and humans, with broad application to analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes.
 The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is a complex process that involves multiple steps and interactions between different proteins. To understand how this pathway functions in quantitative terms, we developed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are all critical for snap-action control. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of apoptosis and may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
 The placenta is a vital organ that protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and pathogens. Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cross the placental barrier and cause severe infections in the fetus. We previously identified the L. monocytogenes protein Internalin P (InlP) as a secreted virulence factor critical for placental infection. Here, we show that InlP binds to human afadin, a protein associated with cell-cell junctions. We also find that InlP enhances L. monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the placental barrier during infection.
 Treponema pallidum is a bacterium that causes syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease. The proteome of T. pallidum is not well understood, so researchers used mass spectrometry to study the proteome of T. pallidum during infection in rabbits. They identified 557 unique proteins, 106 of which were previously annotated as uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins. They also characterized the proteins based on their predicted biological function and localization. This study provides valuable insights into the proteome of T. pallidum during infection and paves the way for improved understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.
 Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key signaling molecule that regulates many cellular processes, including metabolism, cell proliferation, and immune response. PKA is activated by the binding of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to its regulatory subunit (R), which then releases the catalytic subunit (C) to phosphorylate downstream substrates. The R subunit of PKA is a multi-domain protein that includes two tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and -B). In this study, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the dynamics of CBD-A and -B in the apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms of RIα (91-379), a two-domain construct that spans the inhibitory site and both CBDs. Our results show that each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive conformations independently of the adjacent CBD within a nearly degenerate free energy landscape. Binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy by selecting the active conformation within each CBD and stabilizing the inter-CBD contacts. The CBD-A/B interface requires both cAMP and the indole of W260 to form, and although it is not required for the intra-domain conformational selection, it contributes to the activation of PKA by occluding C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. Our investigation revealed that cAMP-binding does not fully quench the dynamics of the CBDs, with major loci of residual dynamics found both at the inter-CBD interface and within each tandem CBD. The residual dynamics profiles of the structurally homologous CBD-A and -B are different, supporting the notion that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics. Our results provide new insights into the dynamics of CBD-A and -B and their role in the activation of PKA.
 The interferon ( IFN ) -stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) is an important protein in antiviral immunity. To understand its role in the immune response, researchers compared the proteomes of ISG15-/- and ISG15+/+ bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) after vaccinia virus ( VACV ) infection. The results showed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) were altered in ISG15-/- BMDM treated with IFN. Mitochondrial respiration, ATP, and ROS production were higher in ISG15+/+ BMDM than in ISG15-/- BMDM following IFN treatment. Additionally, ISG15-/- macrophages were permissive for VACV replication following IFN treatment. In conclusion, ISG15 governs the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, specifically OXPHOS and mitophagy, broadening its physiological role as an antiviral agent.
βTrCP is a protein that helps the cell get rid of unwanted proteins. HIV-1 has a protein called Vpu that binds to βTrCP and helps the virus infect cells by making it harder for the cell to get rid of the virus. In this study, the authors found that Vpu can also be degraded by βTrCP. They found that this happens when the cells are in early mitosis, a stage of the cell cycle where the DNA is being divided. They also found that this degradation happens because of a specific phosphorylation event on Vpu. This degradation of Vpu makes it harder for the virus to infect cells, which may help the body fight the virus.
 We propose two hypotheses to explain how tissue patterning is coordinated with whole-body development. Our first hypothesis is that tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time. Our second hypothesis is that tissue patterning aligns at developmental milestones. We developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae using the expression of canonical patterning genes, linking our scheme to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupariation. We used our scheme to explore how the progression of pattern changes when developmental time is altered either by changing temperature or by altering the timing of hormone synthesis that drives developmental progression. We found that tissue patterning always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these key developmental events represent milestones. Between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. Furthermore, our data showed that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage. Thus, for wing disc patterning, wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone. Our findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. Furthermore, our work provides an important glimpse into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole.
 In this study, the authors investigate the role of the ESCRT regulator Did2 in endosomal transport in the fungal hyphae of Ustilago maydis. They find that Did2 is important for the maturation of early endosomes and the identity of the endosomal membrane. Loss of Did2 results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. Furthermore, the late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Consistently, molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, explaining the disturbed processive movement. The endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 is hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. In conclusion, the ESCRT regulator Did2 coordinates precise maturation of endosomes and thus provides the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport.
 Riboswitches are RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in response to specific ligands. They are composed of two domains: an aptamer that binds the ligand and an expression platform that modulates gene expression. Riboswitches can regulate transcription or translation. The adenine riboswitches of Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnificus differ in their regulation regimes. The B . subtilis pbuE riboswitch requires co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, while the V . vulnificus add riboswitch can bind to adenine after transcription is completed. The rate of transcription is critical for the B . subtilis pbuE riboswitch to perform efficiently, which is in agreement with a kinetic regulation. Our results suggest that the nature of gene regulation control, that is transcription or translation, may have a high importance in riboswitch regulatory mechanisms.
5′ RNA-seq is a powerful tool for detecting and analyzing transcription initiation events in bacteria. In this study, we used 5′ RNA-seq to investigate the occurrence and extent of primer-dependent initiation (PDI) in Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. We found that PDI is a widespread phenomenon in both organisms, and that it is growth phase-dependent. Specifically, we found that PDI is more prevalent during stationary phase in both E. coli and V. cholerae, and that it is preferentially targeted to promoters with the sequence T−1A+1 or G−1G+1. We also found that PDI leads to the production of full-length transcripts that begin with the sequence 5′-UA or 5′-GG, respectively. These findings suggest that a growth phase-dependent process that preferentially generates 5′-UA and 5′-GG oligoribonucleotides occurs in both E. coli and V. cholerae. Overall, our study provides new insights into the regulation of transcription initiation in bacteria and highlights the importance of considering PDI when analyzing transcriptomic data.
 In mammals and plants , parental genome dosage imbalance can cause embryo growth abnormalities and reproductive isolation between emerging new species . This is thought to be due to the expression of imprinted genes, which are expressed by a single parental allele. However, the parental conflict theory, which proposes that parental genome imbalances are directly mirrored by antagonistic regulations of imprinted genes encoding maternal growth inhibitors and paternal growth enhancers, has not been directly tested. In this study, we investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis. We found that parental genome imbalance deregulates imprinting using mechanisms independent from known regulators of imprinting. Our results do not support simple models derived from the parental conflict hypothesis and suggest that the network of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes activated in response to parental dosage imbalance is complex.
 The human brain is a complex network of neurons that generates electrical activity, which can be recorded using techniques such as EEG and MEG. These recordings show oscillations of specific frequencies over a non-oscillatory background. In this study, we used mathematical techniques to reverse-engineer network architectures that generate these oscillations. We found that all reconstructed networks shared similar topological features and dynamics, and that the complexity of the network was a good indicator of brain fitness. We also reconstructed putative diseased brains, in which the oscillatory activity was altered, and found consistent alterations of functional connectivity and dynamics. These findings suggest that the dynamics of the brain can be used to infer functional connectivity and that this approach may be useful for understanding the neural basis of health and disease.
 We analyzed the population structure of 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) using ∼60,000 SNPs selected for minimal linkage disequilibrium. We found that the first two principal components (PCs) quantify the Caucasian, African, and Native American origins, while the third and fourth PCs bring out an axis that aligns with known South-to-North geographic location of HGDP Native American samples and further separates MESA Mexican versus Central/South American samples along the same axis. Using k-means clustering computed from the first four PCs, we defined four subgroups of the MESA Hispanic cohort that show close agreement with self-identification, labeling the clusters as primarily Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican. We further demonstrated the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies performed in the United States Hispanic population. We performed pooled and stratified association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions, previously reported in GWAS of triglycerides in Caucasians but as yet unconfirmed in Hispanic populations. We reported statistically significant evidence for genetic association in both genes, and we further demonstrated the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies performed in the United States Hispanic population.
 The Elongator complex is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a role in DNA replication and repair. It has been shown to interact with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the histone chaperones CAF-1 and Asf1. Mutations in the Elongator complex result in loss of transcriptional silencing and increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. The Elongator complex also interacts with the Radical SAM enzyme Elp3, which is required for the integrity of telomeric chromatin in yeast. The Elongator complex is involved in the DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway, which is important for maintaining genome stability.
 We propose a machine learning-assisted triage method for curating biomedical knowledge from publications. Our method uses deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks to classify and rank new publications for curation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the current query-based triage methods, improves efficiency, and enriches curated content. Our method achieves a precision 1 . 81 and 2 . 99 times higher than that obtained by the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. Our method is being implemented in production so that human curators can focus on more challenging tasks to improve the quality of knowledge bases.
 The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare genetic disorder that causes shortened QT intervals and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The Kir2.1 ion channel is responsible for the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1) and is involved in the development of SQTS. In this study, researchers used computer models to investigate the effects of two Kir2.1 mutations, D172N and E299V, on the human atrial action potential. They found that both mutations shortened the action potential duration and increased the effective refractory period, which can lead to re-entry and arrhythmias. The researchers also found that combined block of IKr and IKur was effective in terminating re-entry associated with heterozygous D172N conditions, whereas IKr block alone may be a safer alternative for the E299V mutation. Overall, this study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmias associated with SQT3 Kir2.1 mutations and highlights possible pharmacological strategies for the management of SQT3-linked AF.
 Chagas disease is a complex disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi ( T . cruzi ) and transmitted by hematophagous triatomine insects. It has been gaining attention due to other forms of transmission such as blood transfusions, organ transplantation, ingestion of contaminated food or drinks, and congenital transmission. In this study, the authors investigated if adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ( ASC ) can alter the course of the disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. The results showed that ASC injection early after T . cruzi infection prevented right ventricular remodeling through the modulation of immune responses. Lymphoid organ response to the parasite promoted the control of parasite burden, while the heart, a target organ of Chagas disease, was protected from damage due to an improved control of inflammation in ASC-treated mice. These findings suggest that ASC could be a potential therapeutic approach for Chagas disease.
 Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus. These parasites live in specialized compartments called parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs) within infected mammalian cells. Retro-2 is a small molecule that has been shown to limit the development of LPVs and reduce the number of parasites within them. In this study, we tested the efficacy of Retro-2 and two analogs, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36 . 1, against Leishmania promastigotes in axenic culture and Leishmania amazonensis infections of macrophages. We found that Retro-2cycl was Leishmania static, meaning it did not kill the parasites, while the analogs were Leishmania-cidal, meaning they killed the parasites. We also found that treatment of infected macrophages with the analogs reversed Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release after LPS activation. These results suggest that retrograde trafficking inhibitors could be a viable strategy for the treatment of Leishmaniasis.
The nucleosome is a fundamental unit of genomic organization that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In this study, we developed a computational method to evaluate the sensitivity of a transcription factor to nucleosome positioning. We identified the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a ( AML-1a ) transcription factor as potentially sensitive to nucleosome positioning within the mouse Ly49 gene family. We confirmed this result in RMA, a cell line with natural expression of Ly49A, using MNase-Seq to generate a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where the Ly49 gene family is located. Our data suggest that nucleosome-based regulation contributes to the expression of Ly49 genes and that our method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity could aid in dissecting the regulatory role of nucleosomes in general.
 The cell cycle is a series of events that allow cells to grow and divide. The process is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are activated by phosphorylation of their T-loop. In animals, the only known CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. However, the critical activation step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc25 phosphatases rather than unrestricted T-loop phosphorylation. Homologous CDK4 and CDK6 bound to cyclins D are master integrators of mitogenic/oncogenic signaling cascades by initiating the inactivation of the central oncosuppressor pRb and cell cycle commitment at the restriction point. Unlike the situation in CDK1 and CDK2 cyclin complexes, and in contrast to the weak but constitutive T177 phosphorylation of CDK6, we have identified the T-loop phosphorylation at T172 as the highly regulated step determining CDK4 activity. Whether both CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylations are catalyzed by CDK7 remains unclear. To answer this question, we took a chemical-genetics approach by using analogue-sensitive CDK7 (as/as) mutant HCT116 cells, in which CDK7 can be specifically inhibited by bulky adenine analogs. Intriguingly, CDK7 inhibition prevented activating phosphorylations of CDK4/6, but for CDK4 this was at least partly dependent on its binding to p21cip1. In response to CDK7 inhibition, p21-binding to CDK4 increased concomitantly with disappearance of the most abundant phosphorylation of p21, which we localized at S130 and found to be catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2. The S130A mutation of p21 prevented the activating CDK4 phosphorylation, and inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impaired phosphorylations of both p21 and p21-bound CDK4. Therefore, specific CDK7 inhibition revealed the following: a crucial but partly indirect CDK7 involvement in phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6; existence of CDK4-activating kinase (s) other than CDK7; and novel CDK7-dependent positive feedbacks mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2 to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage.
 Meiosis is a complex process that results in the production of haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction. In yeast, entry into meiosis activates transcription factors that trigger a transcriptional cascade resulting in the sequential expression of early, middle, and late meiotic genes. However, these factors are not conserved, and the factors and regulatory mechanisms that ensure proper meiotic gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes are poorly understood. In this study, we report that DUET/MMD1, a PHD finger protein essential for Arabidopsis male meiosis, functions as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis in plants. We found that DUET PHD finger binds H3K4me2 in vitro, and we show that this interaction is critical for function during meiosis. We also show that DUET is required for proper microtubule organization during meiosis II, independently of its function in meiosis I. Remarkably, DUET protein shows stage-specific expression, confined to diplotene. We identify two genes, TDM1 and JAS, as DUET targets, with critical functions in cell cycle transitions and spindle organization in male meiosis, as DUET targets. Our results reveal the action of DUET as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis in plants, and suggest that transcription of meiotic genes is under stagewise control in plants as in yeast.
 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. The most common clinical feature of FXS is intellectual disability. FXTAS is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with FMR1 premutation carriers. FXTAS is characterized by progressive tremor, ataxia, and cognitive decline. The molecular basis of FXTAS is not well understood, but it is thought to be caused by the overproduction of fragile X premutation rCGG repeats. In this study, the authors used a proteomic approach to identify proteins that interact with Pur α, a protein that binds fragile X premutation rCGG repeats. They found that Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of the p68 RNA helicase, could modulate fragile X premutation rCGG repeat-mediated neurodegeneration. The authors also found that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats could decrease the expression of Rm62 posttranscriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript. Further microarray analyses revealed the nuclear accumulation of additional mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses in fragile X premutation flies. These findings suggest that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats could cause deficits in the nuclear export of specific mRNAs, which would predispose neurons to neuronal apoptosis.
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic pathogen that can form biofilms on a variety of surfaces, including the mucus plugs of the cystic fibrosis lung and catheters. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are encased in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The EPS of P . aeruginosa biofilms is composed of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins, but the precise biochemical structure of the polysaccharide component, Psl, has not been determined. In this study, the authors used lectin staining and confocal scanning laser microscopy to visualize Psl on the surface of cells and within the EPS matrix. They found that Psl forms a helical pattern on the bacterial cell surface during biofilm initiation and that the matrix changes structure during biofilm development. The authors propose that Psl is anchored on the cell surface and that programmed cell death and autolysis are used to degrade the matrix in the center of microcolonies to free "the seeds of biofilm" for future dispersal. This study provides new insights into the structure and function of the biofilm matrix and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating biofilm-related infections.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is a highly aggressive and lethal cancer with a poor prognosis. Patient-derived xenografts ( PDX ) and patient-derived organoids ( PDO ) are promising tools for studying PDAC, but their ability to recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities remains largely unaddressed. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Our findings indicate that PDX and PDO successfully recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at the level of simple somatic mutations mainly in driver genes, but not across the greater expanse of annotated mutations. Disease model fidelity is not readily retained when assessing structural variation events, based on heterogeneity we observed across donor-model pairs. However, our results indicate that clustering of large structural variation events across particular chromosomes of the tumours is retained in matching disease models. Our work provides new insights into the interplay and fidelity of different disease models toward recapitulating PDAC heterogeneity and genomics.
 Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women worldwide, including those living in East Asian countries. Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. In the past two decades, more than 1,000 reports have been published addressing the association between variants in candidate genes and breast cancer risk. However, only a few genetic risk factors have been confirmed for this common malignancy. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 20 common genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. However, these newly-identified genetic factors, along with known high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes explain less than 30% of the heritability for this cancer. Furthermore, most GWAS were conducted among women of European ancestry, and many of the variants discovered in European-ancestry populations showed only a weak or no association with breast cancer in other ethnic groups. For example, only 8 of 12 breast cancer risk SNPs identified in women of European ancestry were directly replicated in Chinese population. Therefore, GWAS conducted in non-European women are needed to fully uncover the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility. In this study, we conducted a large GWAS of breast cancer among East Asian women. Our results provide strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 near the TAB2 gene (6q25.1) and identify two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively.
 Cryptococcal meningitis ( CM ) is a major cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is associated with HIV infection.  Cryptococcus neoformans ( Cn ) is the most common cause of CM and is a heterogeneous pathogen with different genetic lineages.  In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity of Cn isolates from HIV-positive South African patients with CM.  We found that the majority of isolates belonged to the VNB lineage, which was associated with worse survival.  We also found that isolates from the VNB lineage had increased laccase activity and ex vivo CSF survival.  These findings suggest that genetic lineage plays an important role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection.  Further investigation into the genetic diversity of Cn in different environments may help us understand the risks associated with different ecotypes and inform strategies for prevention and treatment of CM.
 The pheromone response pathway of the white cell phenotype in Candida albicans is a newly evolved signal transduction pathway that is unique to this species and its close relative C. dubliniensis. The pathway is involved in the formation of a biofilm that facilitates mating between minority opaque cells of opposite mating types. The pathway shares all of the upstream components with the opaque cell signal transduction pathway involved in mating, including the pheromone signal, the pheromone receptors, the heterotrimeric G protein complex, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. However, the downstream target genes were derived from an ancestral biofilm process of a/α cells. The white-specific transcription factor responsible for the downstream response was identified as Tec1, which had previously been shown to play a role in filamentation in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans. The evolution of the white-specific pheromone response pathway suggests a scenario in which all major components of the pathway were derived from three conserved ancestral programs still functioning in C. albicans, providing a possible paradigm for how new signal transduction pathways may evolve.
 Bacteria have a wide range of genomic GC-content, from less than 20% to more than 70%. This variation is generally attributed to differences in the mutation pattern between bacteria. In this study, we examined patterns of synonymous polymorphism using datasets from 149 bacterial species. We found a large excess of synonymous GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations segregating in all but the most AT-rich bacteria, across a broad range of phylogenetically diverse species. We show that the excess of GC→AT SNPs is inconsistent with mutation bias, since it would imply that most GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content. We also show that the patterns are probably not due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, because optimal codons tend to be AT-rich, and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. We therefore conclude that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated to genomic GC-content, we further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
 The study presents a new approach for mapping the observed prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths ( STHs ) in Kenya using Bayesian space-time geostatistical models. The models were used to estimate the combined observed prevalence of STHs across Kenya in 1989 and 2009, and to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009. The results show that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas of high prevalence and warrant mass treatment. The study highlights the importance of using contemporary and accurate data, as well as Bayesian space-time geostatistical models, to inform control strategies for STHs.
γδ T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells are innate lymphocytes that play important roles in host defense against infections. However, their contribution to immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains controversial. We established an in vitro system to study this question. We found that primary splenic iNKT cells obtained from uninfected mice significantly reduce the bacterial burden in the lungs of mice infected with virulent Mtb by the aerosol route. This is the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo. Our finding suggests that iNKT cells have a direct bactericidal effect, even in the absence of synthetic ligands such as α-galactosylceramide.
 Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes that catalyze the formation of covalent bonds between glutamyl and lysyl residues in proteins. These bonds are important for the stability and function of many proteins. In bacteria, TGases are involved in the formation of spore coats, which are important for the survival of spores. In this study, the authors investigated the activity of a TGase from Bacillus subtilis (Tgl) and how it is regulated during spore coat assembly. They found that the activity of Tgl is spatially restricted to the surface of the developing spore and that it is dependent on the prior assembly of its substrates. The authors also identified residues in the vicinity of the active site of Tgl that are critical for the assembly of Tgl and for the cross-linking of its substrates. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of TGase activity during spore coat assembly.
 Opisthorchis viverrini is a food-borne trematode that causes biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma. In Lao PDR, an estimated 2.5 million people are infected with O. viverrini, but epidemiological studies are scarce and the spatial distribution of infection remains to be determined. Our aim was to map the distribution of O. viverrini in southern Lao PDR, identify underlying risk factors, and predict the prevalence of O. viverrini at non-surveyed locations. We carried out a cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey in 51 villages in Champasack province in the first half of 2007. We combined data on demography, socioeconomic status, water supply, sanitation, and behavior with remotely sensed environmental data and fed them into a geographical information system. Bayesian geostatistical models were employed to identify risk factors and to investigate the spatial pattern of O. viverrini infection. Bayesian kriging was utilized to predict infection risk at non-surveyed locations. The prevalence of O. viverrini among 3,371 study participants with complete data records was 61.1%. Geostatistical models identified age, Lao Loum ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation (i.e., rice farmer, fisherman, and animal breeder), and unsafe drinking water source as risk factors for infection. History of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater bodies were found to be protective factors. Spatial patterns of O. viverrini were mainly governed by environmental factors with predictive modeling identifying two different risk profiles: low risk of O. viverrini in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor. We present the first risk map of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province, which is important for spatial targeting of control efforts. Infection with O. viverrini appears to be strongly associated with exposure to the second intermediate host fish, human behavior and culture, whereas high transmission is sustained by the lack of sanitation.
 This study examines the importance of drains as larval habitats for mosquitoes in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The study found that drains are a significant source of mosquito larvae, particularly for the Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes that transmit lymphatic filariasis and malaria, respectively. The study also found that drains with stagnant water were more likely to contain mosquito larvae than drains with flowing water. The study suggests that targeting drains for vector control efforts could be an effective way to reduce the transmission of these diseases in Dar es Salaam.
 Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. It is estimated that 3.6 billion people are at risk of infection with DENV in more than 100 countries. In this study, the authors found that DENV infection increases the activity of HMGCR, which is involved in cholesterol synthesis, through the inactivation of AMPK. This leads to an increase in cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is necessary for the formation of replicative complexes. The authors also found that the inhibition of AMPK activity by metformin decreased the activity of HMGCR and the formation of replicative complexes. These findings suggest that AMPK may be a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs against DENV.
70S ribosomes are complex molecular machines that play a crucial role in protein synthesis. The process of tRNA translocation through the ribosome is a key step in protein synthesis, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome to provide a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape. We identified sets of residues that undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function and estimated the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation. This analysis, in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation, provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding the physical-chemical properties that dictate the biological dynamics of the ribosome.
 The genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) is not yet fully understood , although some oncogenic mutations have been identified . To explore genetic profiles of MTCs , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 . Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced . We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples . The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene , which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) . We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH . To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK , customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients . Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions were identified . Additional PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing , confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion , indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . Notably , a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor , crizotinib . In conclusion , we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC . Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors . Furthermore , the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy .
 Asymptomatic leishmaniasis may drive the epidemic of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and is an important challenge to the goal of joint VL elimination initiative taken by three Asian countries. The role of asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission, prognosis at the individual level, and rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) needs to be evaluated. This study was designed to determine the actual burden of asymptomatic cases and pattern of disease progression and rate of sero-conversion among them in an endemic area of Malda district, West Bengal. Out of 2890 total population, 2603 were screened and antileishmanial antibody was detected in 185 individuals, of whom 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such history. Seventy-nine such individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis and ten as active VL with a ratio of 7:9. Amongst asymptomatically infected persons, disease transformation in 8/77 (10.39%) and sero-conversion in 62/77 (80.52%) cases were noted. Seven (9.09%) remained sero-positive even after three years. Progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey. If there are no VL/PKDL cases for two or more years, it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years, if there are such asymptomatic cases. So, asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme.
 Genome stability is important for normal cellular survival and growth. In contrast, genome instability is associated with abnormal cellular growth. For example, tumor cells often contain multiple genome rearrangements and/or aneuploidy, and such events are thought to contribute to the development and progression of cancer. Genome rearrangements are also associated with inborn genetic diseases. For instance, copy number changes mediated by segmental duplications are associated with a diversity of genetic diseases, and whole chromosome aneuploidy can cause diseases like Down Syndrome. While the association of genome rearrangements and aneuploidy with human genetic disease is well established, the genetic factors that suppress or enhance genome rearrangements and aneuploidy are less well understood. We previously developed quantitative genetic assays for measuring the rates at which GCRs occur in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These assays, and modified versions of them, select for progeny that lose a nonessential chromosome arm due to a GCR mediated by either non-repetitive, low-copy repeat, or high-copy repeat DNA and allow quantitative genetic analysis of the pathways that suppress or promote the formation of GCRs. Genetic studies using these assays have revealed that numerous genes and pathways contribute to genome stability by suppressing the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) and/or the loss or gain of whole chromosomes. To fully understand the mechanisms by which GCRs are formed, it is often necessary to determine their structures and sequence their rearrangement breakpoints. However, such analysis of rearranged genomes remains a challenge, particularly due to the large number that must be analyzed to determine the mechanisms by which the GCRs were formed. A number of different techniques have been used to analyze the structure of GCRs including Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) to determine the size of rearranged chromosomes, different methods for PCR amplification and sequencing of rearrangement breakpoints, cloning and/or restriction mapping of rearrangement breakpoints, array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) that allows for the identification of regions of copy number change but does not provide information about connectivity of the rearranged regions, and next-generation DNA sequencing, which has the potential to provide considerable detail about the structure of genome rearrangements. However, all of these methods fail to scale when analyzing a large number of rearranged genomes, due to either high costs or the tedious natures of the methods. In this study, we adapted a PCR-based method, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), to supplement the analysis of Ty1-mediated GCRs in a manner that scales well in terms of both cost and time. MLPA is a multiplex ligation-dependent amplification technique that has been used to identify duplications, deletions, and aneuploidy in human cells. Briefly, multiple pairs of oligonucleotide probes are designed such that each probe in a pair hybridizes next to the other member of the pair at regions of interest in the genome. The total length of each pair of probes is distinct and is used to identify specific regions in the genome on the basis of the length of the final MLPA product. The probes are hybridized to genomic DNA, and then adjacent probes are ligated and amplified using a common pair of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primers. Products are separated and their length and fluorescent intensities measured using capillary electrophoresis. Analysis of the fluorescent intensities allows the determination of copy number differences between control and experimental samples. The main advantage of MLPA is its ability to provide copy number variation data for targeted regions in a rapid, inexpensive, and highly parallel manner. While MLPA does not provide the dense genome-wide coverage of aCGH or next-generation sequencing, it can cover multiple regions of interest simultaneously at a density sufficient for many types of genetic studies. In the present study, we demonstrate the utility of MLPA for analyzing GCRs by investigating the target site bias of Ty1-mediated GCRs, RAD52-independent formation of Ty1-mediated translocations, and aneuploidy induced by deletion of RTT109, a gene encoding a histone acetyltransferase.
 We present a new method for protein docking that uses the semi-definite programming-based underestimation (SDU) algorithm to find the global minimum of a funnel-shaped free energy function in the space of rigid body motions. The method, called SDU-Dock, is based on a cyclic coordinate descent strategy that alternates between rotational and translational moves. We show that SDU-Dock is effective in finding broad energy funnels and generating high quality docking predictions. We also introduce a new strategy, SDU2, that separately optimizes the distance of the two proteins and explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes. SDU2 is more effective and improves efficiency by a factor of 10 compared to SDU1. Our results suggest that the SDU2 strategy is similar to docking by repeated micro-collisions and provides interesting biophysical insights.
