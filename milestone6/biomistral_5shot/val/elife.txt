 The study by Cheng et al. 2021 investigates the role of the Notch signaling pathway in cell fate reprogramming in the C. elegans germline. The authors found that Notch signaling promotes reprogramming by activating specific genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and identifying the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial Notch target facilitating reprogramming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause serious infections in humans. In this study, researchers found that a protein called SKAP2 is important for protecting against K. pneumoniae infections. SKAP2 helps neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell, to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can kill the bacteria. The researchers found that SKAP2 is required for maximal ROS production in response to K. pneumoniae, and that it is involved in the activation of several signaling pathways that are important for host defense against the bacteria. This study provides new insights into the role of SKAP2 in host defense against K. pneumoniae infections.
 Plasmodium vivax is a parasite that causes malaria in humans and is transmitted by mosquitoes. Unlike other types of malaria, P. vivax has a special type of parasite called hypnozoites that can lie dormant in the liver for years before causing a relapse infection. A mathematical model was developed to understand the dynamics of hypnozoites in the liver and how they contribute to the transmission of P. vivax. The model was validated against data from tropical strains of P. vivax and showed that relapses are more common in individuals with more hypnozoites. The model also showed that targeting hypnozoites with drugs could reduce the transmission of P. vivax.
 The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical forest on Earth and plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate. However, the Amazon is under threat from deforestation and selective logging. In this study, the authors used a new modeling approach to predict the post-disturbance carbon recovery potential of the Amazon rainforest. They found that the recovery potential varies across the Amazon basin and is influenced by factors such as climate, soil, and initial biomass. The authors also developed a comprehensive map of post-disturbance carbon recovery potential in the Amazon rainforest. Their findings provide important information for policymakers and land managers to develop effective strategies for protecting and restoring the Amazon rainforest.
 Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) are cells in the brain that can divide and give rise to new neurons and other types of brain cells. These cells are important for the development of the brain and for repairing damage to the brain. However, it is not clear how NSCs work or what makes them different from other types of cells in the brain. In this study, the authors used a new method to identify and isolate NSCs from the brain of adult mice. They found that there are two types of NSCs: one type that is quiescent ( not dividing) and another type that is actively dividing. The authors also found that these two types of NSCs have different properties and may have different functions in the brain. This study provides new information about how NSCs work and may help us understand how to use them for brain repair.
Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel that plays a crucial role in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues . Recent studies have shown that Piezo1 channels may be non-uniformly distributed across the cell membrane, which could affect their ability to detect and transduce forces. In this study, the authors used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Their data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that both at endogenous densities (1-2 channels/μm2) and at non-physiological densities (10-100 channels/μm2) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap, Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension. The results suggest that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. This property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of force sensing and transduction in cells.
 The study investigates how decisions are made when there is uncertainty in the information available. The authors propose a model that suggests that decisions are made by accumulating evidence over time until it reaches a certain level. The model also predicts how noise affects the decision-making process. The authors tested these predictions by manipulating the noise in a visual task and measuring how it affected the speed, accuracy, and confidence of the decisions made. The results of the study support the predictions of the model and provide new insights into how decisions are made under uncertain conditions.
 The insulin-like signaling pathway helps control aging in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans by inactivating the transcription factor DAF-16 . Calcineurin (PP2B) is a protein phosphatase that also affects aging in C. elegans, but how it does so is unknown. Here, researchers found that Calcineurin and a related protein called UNC-43 both regulate DAF-16. UNC-43 phosphorylates DAF-16, which promotes its nuclear localization and activity, while Calcineurin removes this phosphorylation, inactivating DAF-16. This regulation of DAF-16 by Calcineurin and UNC-43 is independent of the insulin-like signaling pathway and occurs in response to various stresses. The researchers also found that a similar regulatory mechanism exists in mammalian cells, where the protein FOXO is regulated by Calcineurin and a related protein called CAMKII. These findings provide new insights into how protein phosphatases regulate aging and stress responses in both worms and mammals.
In this study, researchers used a novel approach to study how motor actions are organized in a complex behavior. They focused on the grooming behavior of fruit flies, which involves a series of movements to clean different parts of the body. The researchers used genetic tools to activate specific subsets of neurons that control different parts of the grooming sequence. They found that these motor programs are organized in a hierarchical way, with later-occurring movements being suppressed by earlier-occurring movements. The researchers also developed a computational model that successfully reproduced the observed grooming sequence. This study provides the first example of an innate motor sequence being implemented using the prevailing model for generating human action sequences.
 The study found that Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) plays an important role in coordinating many of the key processes involved in meiotic chromosome segregation. Sgol2 is a protein that helps protect cohesin , a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together. It also helps turn off the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) , which is a mechanism that ensures that all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle before cell division. Sgol2 does this by binding directly to PP2A and Mad2 , two proteins involved in the SAC. It also helps recruit the kinesin MCAK to kinetochores, which helps to form K-fibers, the structures that pull sister chromatids apart during cell division. Lastly, Sgol2 helps limit the stretching of chromosomes during cell division. Overall, the study suggests that Sgol2 plays a crucial role in ensuring that meiotic chromosome segregation is accurate and reliable.
5HT-induced LTF in Aplysia sensory neurons requires RNA localization and protein synthesis. In this study, the authors investigated whether in addition to promoting local translation, 5HT-induced stimulation also triggers directed trafficking of RNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses. Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons revealed that translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. The authors found that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but that translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. The authors also found that spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues. The authors conclude that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. , Introduction: 5HT-induced LTF in Aplysia sensory neurons requires RNA localization and protein synthesis.

To study RNA localization during synapse-specific plasticity , the authors cultured bifurcated SNs with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the connection with one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF . The authors asked whether and how stimuli regulate RNA and protein localization and concentration by analyzing the distribution of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , RNA binding proteins , and translation factors . , Results: The authors found that rRNA , three specific mRNAs , ribosomal proteins , and translation factors were delivered throughout the SN , to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites , but that translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation . These results indicate that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. , Conclusion: The authors conclude that spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues.

The study by Teeling et al . investigates the role of mechanical forces in the development of multicellular structures from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The authors used CRISPR interference to silence the genes ROCK1 and CDH1, which regulate cortical tension and cell-cell adhesion, respectively. By creating mosaic populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system, the authors were able to induce controlled symmetry-breaking events within the hiPSC population. The study found that induction of mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in a 'bottom-up' cell-driven pattern formation of hiPSC colonies while preserving pluripotency. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of multicellular structures from hiPSCs and may have important implications for the development of stem cell-based therapies.
 We propose a normative model of visual working memory (VWM) that predicts how the encoding precision of items in a set varies with set size and with the probing probability of each item. The model is based on the idea that subjects allocate resource to items in a set to minimize the expected cost of errors in a delayed-estimation task. The model accounts well for effects of set size and probing probability in a variety of delayed-estimation experiments. It also makes a principled prediction that subjects sometimes leave task-relevant items out of VWM, which is supported by data from delayed-estimation experiments. The model also makes a prediction that subjects sometimes encode only a subset of task-relevant items in a change detection task, which is supported by data from this task. The model predicts that the total amount of resource that subjects allocate to items in a set varies non-monotonically with set size, which is supported by data from delayed-estimation experiments. The model also predicts that the total amount of resource that subjects allocate to items in a set is not fixed, but is optimized to minimize the expected cost of errors.
Plants use autophagy to protect themselves against pathogens . However, how pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes is unknown. In this study, researchers found that an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. This effector depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus, a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses. This study provides new insights into how pathogens manipulate host autophagy to promote their own survival.
 Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are cells that play a crucial role in the repair of damaged heart tissue. When the heart is injured, CFs are activated and start to produce collagen, a protein that helps to repair the damaged tissue. However, if the injury is severe, the CFs can start to produce too much collagen, which can lead to scarring of the heart tissue. Researchers are trying to understand how to control the activity of CFs so that they produce just the right amount of collagen to repair the damaged tissue. To do this, they need to understand how different environmental factors affect the activity of CFs. In this study, researchers used a special device to apply different environmental factors, such as mechanical strain and oxygen levels, to CFs and then measured how the CFs responded. They found that different combinations of environmental factors can have different effects on the activity of CFs. For example, applying both mechanical strain and low oxygen levels to CFs can cause them to produce more collagen than if only one of these factors is applied. This information could help researchers develop new treatments for heart disease.
The molecules that make up our DNA are organized into structures called nucleosomes, which are like beads on a string. These nucleosomes are important for regulating gene expression, which is the process by which cells make proteins. In order to understand how nucleosomes work, scientists have been studying the proteins that interact with them. One of these proteins is called H2A . Z, which is important for regulating gene expression. In flies, there is only one gene that codes for H2A . Z, called domino. This gene produces two different versions of the protein, called DOM-A and DOM-B, through a process called alternative splicing. Alternative splicing is when a single gene produces multiple different versions of a protein. Scientists have been studying the functions of these two versions of the protein, and they have found that they have different functions. DOM-A is involved in a process called histone acetylation, which is important for regulating gene expression. DOM-B is involved in a process called nucleosome remodeling, which is also important for regulating gene expression. These two processes are different, but they both help regulate gene expression. This work shows how alternative splicing can produce different versions of a protein that have different functions.
β-Catenin (Ctnnb1) is a protein that is important for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation. In this study, researchers used transgenic mice to investigate the functions of Ctnnb1 in NMJ formation. They found that Ctnnb1 is important for presynaptic differentiation, which is the process by which nerve terminals develop and form connections with muscle cells. They also found that Ctnnb1 regulates this process through transcription, which is the process by which genes are turned on or off. The researchers also identified a protein called Slit2 that may be a retrograde factor that is used by muscle cells to direct presynaptic differentiation. This protein is a type of extracellular matrix protein that is known to repel or collapse neuronal axons in other parts of the body. The researchers found that Slit2 is able to induce clusters of synaptophysin, a protein that is important for synaptic transmission, in cultured neurons. They also found that expressing Slit2 specifically in muscle cells was able to rescue NMJ deficits in Ctnnb1-mutant mice. These findings suggest that Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation through transcription, and that Slit2 may be a retrograde factor that is used by muscle cells to direct presynaptic differentiation.
 The way that cells interact with each other is important for many processes in the body, such as tissue development and wound healing. However, it is not clear how these interactions are regulated. To study this, researchers used a new method that allowed them to measure the forces that cells exert on each other. They found that the forces were related to the position of the cells within the tissue and to the way that the cells were connected to each other. They also found that the forces were related to the way that the cells were able to move and change shape. These findings provide new insights into how cells interact with each other and how these interactions are regulated.
 Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine (Q) tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. In this study, the authors used various biophysical techniques to investigate the structure and function of HTT. They found that HTT is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid shape. The authors also showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases the α-helical properties of HTT and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. These findings provide an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on HTT, causing the disease. The authors suggest that the polyglutamine expansion may affect the structure and function of HTT by altering its solenoid shape. This study provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HD and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
 Iron is essential for life, but too much iron can be toxic. To maintain the right amount of iron in cells, organisms have evolved mechanisms to store and release iron as needed. One such mechanism is ferritinophagy, a process in which the protein ferritin is degraded to release its iron content. NCOA4 is a protein that helps to target ferritin for degradation via autophagy. In this study, the authors used a combination of biochemical and genetic techniques to investigate the role of NCOA4 in ferritinophagy. They found that NCOA4 binds directly to ferritin and that this binding is important for the degradation of ferritin via autophagy. They also found that the levels of NCOA4 are regulated by the amount of iron in the cell, and that this regulation is important for maintaining the right amount of iron in cells. The authors used zebrafish and cultured cells to study the role of NCOA4 in ferritinophagy, and their findings have important implications for understanding how cells regulate their iron levels.
 The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is a part of the brain that is important for higher-level thinking. However, it is not clear how the different parts of the LPFC work together. In this study, researchers used a special kind of MRI called fMRI to look at how different parts of the LPFC work together. They found that the different parts of the LPFC work together in a way that makes sense for higher-level thinking. They also found that the way the different parts of the LPFC work together is related to how well people do on tests of higher-level thinking. This study provides new information about how the brain works and how it is related to thinking.
 Cortical expansion and folding are linked to higher intelligence in mammals, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. In this study, the authors found that expressing TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells and promoted the generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia, which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased the generation of oRGs. The authors also found that localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, the authors have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding.
 In plants, the immune system is activated by salicylic acid (SA) which causes the transcriptional coactivator NPR1 to enter the nucleus and activate immune-related genes. However, NPR1 is also degraded by the proteasome, which raises the question of how NPR1 can activate immune-related genes if it is constantly being destroyed. In this study, the authors found that NPR1 is first ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase, which promotes its association with chromatin and expression of immune-related genes. Only when NPR1 is polyubiquitinated by an E4 ligase is it targeted for proteasomal degradation. The authors also found that two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases, UBP6/7, enhance NPR1 longevity by opposing the ubiquitin ligase activities. These findings suggest that immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquitinases that fine-tune activity of NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover.
24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) are produced in plants to silence transposable elements, transgenes, repetitive sequences, and endogenous genes. These siRNAs are generated by nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ), and DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ). However, the precursors of these siRNAs are mostly undefined. In this study, the authors identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) that accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. These P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.
 The brain is a complex network of cells that communicate with each other to perform various functions. As we grow and develop, our brains undergo many changes to become the complex and sophisticated networks we have today. However, it is not well understood how these changes occur and how they are regulated. In this study, the authors used high-resolution in vivo electrophysiology to investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development in immature mice. They found that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. The authors also found a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. These findings suggest that mechanisms to developmentally regulate functional network capacity may be evolutionarily conserved and manifest on the systems level as similar, discrete states.
 Plasmodium falciparum is a parasite that causes malaria in humans. It has a complex genetic structure that allows it to evade the host immune system and establish chronic infections. The parasite has multiple copies of a gene called var that encodes proteins that bind to host receptors. These proteins are expressed sequentially in a process called clonal antigenic variation. A mathematical model was developed to understand how the parasite population structure is shaped by immune selection and demographic forces. The model showed that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of discrete, non-overlapping antigenic repertoires even when antigenic variability is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination. The model also showed that the degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms that shape the genetic diversity of P. falciparum and have implications for malaria control and vaccine development.
 The human pathogen Shigella flexneri secretes a protein called OspI that deamidates a glutamine residue in the host protein UBC13, which is involved in the immune response. This deamidation weakens the interaction between UBC13 and the RING-finger domain of TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and inhibits the immune response. The authors used NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and in-vitro ubiquitination assays to investigate the mechanism of this inhibition. They found that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by three mechanisms: a new intramolecular salt-bridge, salt-bridge competition, and transient repulsion. These findings highlight the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating protein-protein interactions and suggest that this mechanism could be at play in other signaling pathways.
 The brain is made up of many different types of neurons, each with its own unique role in processing information. One way to understand the function of a particular type of neuron is to manipulate its activity and see how this affects the behavior of the animal. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including optogenetics, which allows researchers to turn specific types of neurons on or off using light.  In this study, researchers used optogenetics to manipulate two different types of neurons in the auditory cortex of mice while they were awake and listening to tones. They found that when they turned off the somatostatin-positive (Sst+) neurons, the mice's response to the tones became stronger, while when they turned off the parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) neurons, the mice's response to the tones became weaker. However, when they turned on the Sst+ and Pvalb+ neurons, they did not see any difference in the mice's response to the tones.  The researchers then used a simple computer model to try to understand why turning on and off the two different types of neurons had such different effects. They found that the difference was due to small changes in the way the neurons were activated. This suggests that the way we manipulate neurons can have a big effect on the conclusions we draw about their function.  Overall, this study highlights the importance of carefully considering the methods used to manipulate neurons in order to accurately understand their function. It also shows that even small changes in the way neurons are activated can have a big impact on behavior.
 The human brain is made up of many different regions that work together to perform tasks such as thinking, feeling, and moving. These regions communicate with each other using electrical signals called oscillations. These oscillations can be thought of as the brain’s “rhythm” and they are thought to be important for many different brain functions. One of the most important brain functions is working memory (WM), which is the ability to hold information in your mind while you are performing other tasks. Researchers have found that certain types of oscillations, called theta waves, are important for WM. They have also found that these theta waves can be influenced by a technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In this study, researchers used tACS to influence the theta waves in the brain while participants performed a WM task. They found that when the theta waves were in-phase, participants performed better on the task. They also found that theta waves in different parts of the brain were in-phase with each other when participants performed well on the task. These findings suggest that theta waves are important for WM and that tACS can be used to influence these waves in a way that improves performance on WM tasks.
 In the early stages of embryonic development, the polarity of the embryo is determined by a set of molecules that are inherited from the mother. These molecules are called maternal determinants and they are responsible for setting the cell fates of the embryo. In amniote embryos, such as chick embryos, the polarity is determined by a molecule called cVg1, which is expressed in the posterior part of the embryo before gastrulation. In this study, the authors used a molecular screen to identify the upstream regulators of cVg1. They found that the transcription factor Pitx2 is a direct regulator of cVg1 expression. The authors also showed that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation and that it acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. The study suggests that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.
 The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is able to detect and respond to dynamic changes in odor concentration. In order to understand how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, researchers subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). They found that the PN output strongly signaled the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs, PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.
 In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We furthermore show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.
Bacteriophages (or "phages") are viruses that infect and kill bacteria. They are promising tools for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and manipulating microbial ecosystems. The receptor binding protein (RBP) of a phage is responsible for its ability to infect and kill bacteria. RBPs can bind to a variety of cell surface molecules, including proteins, polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and carbohydrate-binding moieties. Phages exhibit high functional plasticity through genetic alterations to their RBPs, which can modulate activity and host range. However, we currently lack a systematic and comprehensive understanding of how RBP mutations influence phage activity and host range. In this study, the authors used deep mutational scanning (DMS) of the RBP to identify molecular determinants of activity and host range. They developed a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage engineering method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library Expression) to create a large, unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus. Using ORACLE, they systematically and comprehensively mutated the tip domain of the T7 phage RBP and quantified the functional role of all variants on multiple bacterial hosts. They generated high-resolution functional maps delineating regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns, many of which were previously unknown. They discovered T7 variants with far greater virulence than wildtype T7, demonstrating that even those natural phages that are well adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy. However, many variants highly adapted to one host performed poorly on others, underscoring a tradeoff between activity and host range. This functional screening highlights ideal regions of the tip domain for engineering host range. Furthermore, they demonstrated the functional potential of RBPs by discovering gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constriction variants that selectively eliminate specific hosts. To demonstrate the therapeutic value of ORACLE, they engineered T7 variants that avert emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections (UTIs). Their study explains the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range. ORACLE provides a generalized framework to describe sequence–function relationships in phages to elucidate the molecular basis of phages, the most abundant life form on earth.
The study investigated the neural basis for a strategy used by individuals with congenital amusia to process speech. Congenital amusia is a rare condition characterized by impaired perception of and memory for pitch. The study found that individuals with amusia had decreased functional connectivity between language-related regions in the left hemisphere and pitch-related regions in the right hemisphere during speech perception. This connectivity difference reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners. The results suggest a compensatory mechanism in which individuals with amusia rely less on pitch cues during speech perception.
DFT2 is a recently discovered contagious cancer in Tasmanian devils that has been spreading in a small population. In this study, the authors found that DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules, which are important for immune recognition of cancer cells. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. The authors also found that loss of MHC class I is emerging in vivo, suggesting that DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. These findings suggest that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, but that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2.
 The retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) is a region of the brain that is important for spatial navigation and other cognitive functions. In this study, researchers used optogenetic circuit mapping to identify the neural circuits that process spatial and non-spatial information in the RSG. They found that the anterior thalamus, which is a source of spatial information, preferentially controls low-rheobase ( LR ) pyramidal cells in the RSG, while the claustrum, which is a source of mostly non-spatial information, preferentially controls regular-spiking ( RS ) cells in the RSG. The researchers also found that the synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction. These findings suggest that LR neurons are ideally positioned to contribute to the initial spatial orientation computations performed in the RSG.
 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It is also a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms underlying the development of neurodegenerative diseases after TBI are not fully understood. In this study, researchers used a novel zebrafish model to investigate the role of seizures in the development of tauopathy after TBI. They found that TBI induced seizures and tauopathy in the zebrafish model. Treatment with dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsants reduced tauopathy and cell death. These findings suggest that seizures play a role in the development of tauopathy after TBI and that dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsants may be effective treatments.
 The brain is made up of many different regions that work together to perform various functions. These regions can be thought of as being connected to each other in a complex network. Researchers have been studying this network using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ). fMRI measures changes in blood flow in the brain, which can be used to infer changes in brain activity. By looking at how different regions of the brain are connected to each other, researchers can gain insights into how the brain works. However, there are many different ways to measure and analyze these connections, and it is not always clear which methods are most accurate or useful. In this study, the authors used fMRI data from a large group of people to investigate how different methods of measuring and analyzing brain connections relate to each other and to behavior. They found that the way that different regions of the brain are connected to each other can vary greatly from person to person, and that this variation is strongly associated with behavior and lifestyle. The authors suggest that this variation is often being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity, but that it is actually more likely to be due to differences in the spatial arrangement of brain regions. They also suggest that different methods of measuring and analyzing brain connectivity may be better suited to different types of questions. Overall, the authors provide important new insights into how the brain is connected and how these connections relate to behavior and lifestyle.
 The study by Duan et al. investigates the role of the C-terminus of the L-type calcium channel (CaV1.3) in regulating its activity. The authors found that multiple motifs in the C-terminus of CaV1.3 work together to tune down the channel's activity. They also found that acute C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) can reduce the channel's activity in a way that is distinct from conventional inhibitions. The study provides new insights into the regulation of CaV1.3 activity and has potential implications for the treatment of diseases such as Parkinson's disease.
 Brain stimulation can be used to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders by modulating the excitability of neural circuits and driving neuroplasticity . However, the effects of stimulation on large-scale networks are largely unexplored. In this study, researchers used a large-scale optogenetic interface to stimulate excitatory neurons and record brain activity across primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex in two macaques. They found that stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas within minutes. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network, reflecting the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity. These changes were consistent with Hebbian plasticity models, suggesting that stimulation-based neurorehabilitation may be effective in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.
 The primary visual cortex ( V1 ) is a crucial part of the visual system that processes visual information from the retina. Damage to V1 can lead to loss of conscious visual perception and impact on human patients. In this study, researchers used magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to investigate the neural consequences of a rare case of a Rhesus macaque ( monkey S ) born without V1. Despite the lack of V1, monkey S's in-group behavior was normal, but visual task training was impaired. MRI revealed that visual stimulation under anaesthesia activated the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) and pulvinar, while full-field moving dots activated V5/MT. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Functional connectivity analysis showed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. The study found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena. The findings suggest that visual information may be processed through alternative pathways in the absence of V1.
The human innate immune system detects foreign DNA in the nucleus of infected cells and assembles supramolecular signaling platforms to trigger inflammatory responses. The molecular mechanisms by which the innate immune sensor IFI16 distinguishes self from nonself DNA are unknown. In this study, the authors used biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques to show that IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. They also demonstrated that nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA.
 Spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) is a new technique that uses two-photon excitation to covalently label proteins in a specific region of interest ( ROI ) in mammalian tissue. This technique can be used to identify the proteins present in the ROI and can be applied to a wide range of biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, human biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem human tissue. The authors used STOMP to examine amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. STOMP can be applied to various biological samples and has the potential to advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification.

 Transposable elements ( TEs ) are segments of DNA that can move from one location to another within a genome. They are thought to have played a role in the evolution of gene regulatory networks in the early mouse embryo. In this study, researchers used epigenomic and transcriptomic data to identify TEs that may be involved in gene regulation. They then used genetic editing to test the function of these TEs in embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. The results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, but that only a minority play significant roles in this process. The researchers highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating the gene regulatory roles of TEs.
 C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has evolved independently in at least 60 plant lineages . The evolution of C4 photosynthesis is not well understood, but it is thought to be driven by a combination of environmental and genetic factors . In this study, the authors used a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental data to investigate the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. They found that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was a flexible process that occurred in four distinct trajectories. The authors suggest that this flexibility may have facilitated the convergent evolution of C4 photosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and may help inform efforts to engineer C4 photosynthesis into crop plants.
 SpoIVA is a bacterial protein that polymerizes in response to ATP hydrolysis. It is involved in the formation of a protective shell around spores, which are dormant cells that protect bacteria from harsh environmental conditions. SpoIVA is closely related to Era, a protein that polymerizes in response to GTP hydrolysis. The authors of this study reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. They found that the altered SpoIVA was able to harness the energy released by GTP or ATP hydrolysis to drive a necessary conformational change in the protein but failed to ultimately polymerize specifically in the presence of GTP. The authors propose that a pronounced reduction in intracellular GTP concentration relative to ATP during the late stages of sporulation could have driven the evolution of SpoIVA to utilize ATP instead of GTP to drive polymerization. This study provides insights into the evolution of nucleotide specificity in proteins and its role in the formation of protective shells around spores.
 Leptin is a hormone that helps regulate energy balance in the body. It is produced by fat cells and sends signals to the brain to tell it how much energy is available. Leptin also plays a role in development, especially in the brain. However, the exact role of leptin in development is not yet fully understood. To study this, researchers used mice that were born without leptin receptors. They then restored leptin signaling either at the fourth or tenth week of life. They found that some defects caused by the lack of leptin signaling in early life could be recovered by restoring it later in life. However, other defects were irreversible and persisted even after leptin signaling was restored. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in development, and that early leptin deficiency can have long-term effects on energy balance, the melanocortin system, reproduction, and brain development.
 The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 recognizes the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 . The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2 , the Gβ protein AGB1 , and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism . Here we show that in the pre-activation state , XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 , and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1 , allowing optimum immune activation . Following the activation by flg22 , XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus . The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD . The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms .
The circadian clock is a biological system that regulates the timing of various processes in living organisms. In Arabidopsis, the circadian clock controls gene expression across the day/night cycle. However, it is unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells and how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. In this study, the authors examined clock activity at the single cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. They found that single cell oscillations were robust, but desynchronized. The authors also observed two waves of clock activity; one going down, and one up the root. They found evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, especially in the root tip. A simple model showed that cell-to-cell coupling and period differences between cells could generate the observed waves. The authors' results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralized mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points.
 In a study of 100,000 patients, 10% of adults visited the clinic because of reduced hearing, but their hearing was clinically normal and should not cause communication difficulties. The authors found that multi-talker speech intelligibility varied widely in normal hearing adults, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured with ear canal EEG recordings. Combining neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds accounted for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. The disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker speech perception identified here could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders.
 The retina is a part of the central nervous system that is supplied with blood by a network of vessels. These vessels are important for the health of the retina and the brain. However, it is difficult to study the flow of blood in these vessels because they are small and the light from the eye blurs them. To solve this problem, researchers have used adaptive optics imaging to measure the flow of blood in the retina. This technique uses a laser to correct for the blurring caused by the eye and to create a clear image of the blood vessels. The researchers have developed a new algorithm that can automatically measure the flow of blood in the retina. They have used this algorithm to measure the flow of blood in vessels of different sizes and have found that the flow varies greatly depending on the size of the vessel. They have also found that the flow is not uniform throughout the vessel and that there are areas of the vessel where the flow is faster and slower. These findings will help researchers understand how the blood flows in the retina and how this affects the health of the retina and the brain.
 The study investigates the mechanisms that discriminate between two different symbiotic developmental fates in plants. The authors found that overexpression of three receptor-like kinase genes ( Nod Factor Receptor 1, Nod Factor Receptor 5, and Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ) can initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Furthermore, these receptors can associate with endogenous SYMRK in roots of the legume Lotus japonicus. The dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signalling independently of either the NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. Only SYMRK but not NFR overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms that discriminate between the two distinct symbiotic developmental fates in plants.
We present a new software toolkit called DeepLabCut that uses deep learning to automatically measure the body posture of animals in images and videos. This toolkit is built on top of existing methods for tracking and localizing individuals in images and videos, and uses a deep learning model that is specifically designed to estimate animal posture. The toolkit is written in Python and is easy to use, even for non-experts in computer vision. It is available for free on GitHub.
 Inflammation is a natural response of the body to fight infection, injury, and stress. However, excessive inflammation can be damaging, so its initiation is highly regulated. Innate immune cells such as macrophages have evolved sensors that can detect pathogens and homeostatic perturbations, which, when activated, induce an immune response. In this study, researchers found that disruption of glycolytic flux in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages can trigger NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. The researchers identified the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and α-enolase as the phenotypically relevant targets of the small molecule GB111-NH2. They found that restoring metabolism downstream of glycolysis also prevented S . typhimurium-induced inflammasome formation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptosis. The researchers also found that glycolytic disruption induced by either the small molecules or S . typhimurium infection impaired NADH production, resulting in the formation of mitochondrial ROS that were essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These findings reveal a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and initiation of inflammation.
 The BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are important for repairing damaged DNA in cells. The PALB2 protein helps these proteins work together. Scientists have found that PALB2 has a special part of the protein that binds to DNA. They have also found that this part of the protein is important for repairing DNA. The scientists have also found that PALB2 can help repair DNA even when it is not bound to BRCA1 or BRCA2. This suggests that PALB2 may have other important functions in cells.
 The shape of bacteria is determined by a cytoskeleton made of actin-like proteins. These proteins form filaments that are arranged in a parallel fashion. However, a new study shows that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB from Caulobacter crescentus forms pairs of antiparallel protofilaments. The study provides an atomic view of these antiparallel protofilaments and shows that they are essential for cell shape maintenance. The study also reveals the mechanism of protofilament formation and explains the inhibitory mechanism of antimicrobial reagents.
 The number of petals in a flower is a robust trait that is usually invariant within species. However, petal number can vary in some species, such as Cardamine hirsuta. The genetic basis for this variation is unknown. In this study, the authors show that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 (AP1) can account for the difference in petal number robustness between species. They found that AP1 has a large effect on petal number in C. hirsuta, which is explained by epistatic interactions between AP1 and petal number QTL. The authors also show that upstream regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to this divergence. These findings provide insights into the evolution of robust traits and the genetic basis of variation within and between species.
β-cells in the pancreas are responsible for producing insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Insulin is produced from a protein called proinsulin, which is folded into a specific shape before being released. However, in some cases, proinsulin does not fold correctly and forms complexes with other proinsulin molecules. These complexes can accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of β-cells, leading to ER stress and eventually to diabetes. In this study, the authors used several lines of evidence to show that aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes form in the ER of β-cells in humans and animal models of diabetes. They also showed that these complexes can accumulate even before β-cells start to fail, suggesting that they may play a role in the early stages of diabetes. The authors conclude that understanding the mechanisms behind proinsulin misfolding and complex formation may help in the development of new treatments for diabetes.
 The nervous system is responsible for processing and responding to information from the environment. However, it is not clear how the nervous system encodes and processes information about the environment to control long-term physiology. In Caenorhabditis elegans, daf-7 and tph-1 are conserved components of neural TGFβ and serotonin signaling pathways, respectively, and are associated with food sensing and modulation of organismal physiology. daf-7 encodes a TGFβ family member, while tph-1 encodes tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis. In C . elegans , daf-7 and tph-1 are expressed in an environmentally responsive manner in specific neurons with food-related functions. daf-7 is expressed in the ASI sensory neurons, whose activities are responsive to bacterial food, and tph-1 is expressed in the NSM foregut neurons, the ADF sensory neurons, and the HSN motorneurons involved in egg-laying. Both serotonin signaling mutants and NSM ablation affect food-modulated locomotion, consistent with the idea that serotonin from NSM acts in this food-related response. In the food-responsive ADF neurons, tph-1 expression is responsive to pathogenic bacteria and starvation, to respectively mediate aversive olfactory plasticity and stress responses. daf-7 and tph-1 are therefore strong candidates for mediating the link between environmental cues and longevity. Nonetheless, how these genes cooperate to quantitatively encode a broad range of food levels to modulate lifespan is unknown. Here we show that daf-7 and tph-1 expression in three pairs of neurons forms a distributed circuit that quantitatively encodes food abundance and mediates dietary effects on lifespan in C . elegans . Specific disruptions to this circuit resulted in corresponding attenuation in the ability to discriminate between food levels in both the gene-expression code and lifespan output . We found that this circuit tunes its own accuracy, largely via the regulation of the dynamic range and variability of food-responsive gene expression by tph-1 and daf-7 signaling, respectively. Our work suggests that neural regulation of gene expression in conserved pathways can couple environmental sensation to physiology.
 In recent years, researchers have discovered that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex play a crucial role in spatial navigation and memory. However, it is still unclear whether grid cells are only active when an animal is physically moving or if they can also be activated by movements of attention. In this study, researchers recorded from single units in the entorhinal cortex of monkeys that were trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus moving in the periphery. They found that a significant population of entorhinal cells had spatially structured receptive fields, which contrasted with recordings obtained in the hippocampus. These results provide evidence that neurons in the macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement and can be activated by movements of attention. This suggests that grid cells may play a role in a range of cognitive functions beyond spatial navigation.
The authors present a standardized task for mice that measures perceptual and value-based decision making. They trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries and collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and providing an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice.
The planarian flatworm is a powerful model for studying regeneration and development. In this study, the authors used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate and analyze the intestinal transcriptome of the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. They found that the intestine is composed of four distinct cell types: goblet cells, phagocytes, absorptive cells, and outer cells. They also identified 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several that are required for production and maintenance of goblet cells. These findings provide a valuable resource for investigating the mechanisms of intestinal regeneration and development.
 In this study, the authors investigated how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to differences in peripheral sensory coding. They found that different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. In species sensitive to waveform variation, the receptors fire a single, time-locked spike in response to an electric stimulus. In contrast, species insensitive to waveform variation have receptors that produce spontaneously oscillating potentials. The authors found that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. These receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, and this was correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. The authors hypothesize that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. Their findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony.
 Bacteriophage BPP-1 is a virus that infects and kills bacteria that cause whooping cough. The virus has a unique structure and a genetic element called a diversity-generating retroelement ( DGR ) that allows it to adapt to new environments. To understand how this virus works, scientists need to know the structure of its proteins. In this study, the authors used cryo electron microscopy to determine the structure of the BPP-1 head at 3.5 Å resolution. They found that the virus has two types of proteins: one that forms a jellyroll shape and one that has a non-circularly permuted HK97-like shape. The authors also found that the virus has a unique way of forming non-covalent chainmail between its proteins. This structure is important for the virus to function properly and for it to be used in phage-display engineering. The authors' findings provide important information about the structure of BPP-1 and its unique features.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes dengue fever in humans. To understand how DENV adapts to different hosts, researchers used deep sequencing to track the evolution of DENV populations in human and mosquito cell lines. They found that the evolution of DENV populations is shaped by a balance between the dynamics of rare beneficial mutations and the significant load of deleterious mutations. Beneficial mutations are clustered in specific regions of the DENV genome and are enriched in regions of the proteome that exhibit structural flexibility. These findings provide insights into the genetic and biophysical principles of flaviviral evolution and reveal parallels between long- and short-term evolutionary scales.
 Ras is a small molecule that helps cells communicate with each other and with their environment. It is found in the cell membrane, which is a thin layer of fat that surrounds the cell. Ras molecules move around in the membrane, and this movement is important for how they work. Scientists have used a technique called single particle tracking to watch how Ras molecules move in the membrane. They found that Ras molecules move in three different ways, which are like different speed limits. They also found that Ras molecules move in and out of different areas of the membrane, which are like different lanes on a highway. These areas are called nanodomains. The scientists used a special kind of microscope to watch Ras molecules move, and they used a computer program to analyze the data. They found that Ras molecules move in and out of nanodomains, and that this movement is important for how Ras works. This information will help scientists understand how Ras helps cells communicate and work.
The Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( BMP ) signaling pathway is a crucial mechanism for patterning the dorsal-ventral ( DV ) axis of embryos in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The BMP signaling gradient is generated by a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, which inhibit BMP signaling. However, the mechanism by which the BMP antagonists generate the gradient is not well understood. In this study, the authors used a combination of quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to investigate the mechanism of BMP gradient formation in zebrafish embryos. They found that the BMP antagonist Chordin does not shuttle BMP ligand, and that a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists does not account for the BMP signaling gradient. Instead, the authors propose that the BMP signaling gradient is generated by a source-sink mechanism, where BMP ligand diffuses from a ventral source to a dorsal sink of BMP antagonists. The authors also found that the diffusion rate of BMP ligand is much faster than previously thought, which supports the source-sink mechanism. Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanism of BMP gradient formation in zebrafish embryos.
 Lysosomes are organelles that break down waste and damaged parts of cells. They do this by using enzymes that digest the waste. To get rid of the waste, the enzymes break it down into smaller pieces that can be taken up by the cell and used to make new things. Some of the waste that lysosomes break down is made up of many small molecules, like sugars or amino acids. To get rid of these small molecules, the cell uses proteins that help them cross the lysosome membrane. These proteins are called transporters.   MFSD1 is a protein that is found in lysosomes and helps get rid of small molecules. It has not been studied very much, but it is thought to be important for the function of lysosomes. In this study, the authors used a number of different techniques to learn more about MFSD1. They found that MFSD1 is important for the function of lysosomes and that it works with another protein called GLMP to help get rid of waste. They also found that MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact with each other. This means that they work together to help get rid of waste. The authors think that MFSD1 and GLMP are part of a complex that helps get rid of waste from lysosomes. They also found that MFSD1 and GLMP are both important for the health of the liver. This means that if either of these proteins is not working properly, it can cause problems with the liver. Overall, this study shows that MFSD1 and GLMP are important for the function of lysosomes and for the health of the liver.
Kinesin is a motor protein that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move along microtubules. The authors obtained atomic models of kinesin bound to microtubules in the absence of nucleotide and after binding of the non-hydrolyzable transition state analog, ADP•Al•Fx. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, the authors infer a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo along the microtubule via kinesin's neck linker element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer ‘gate’ each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules. These findings should provide insights into the mechanisms that generate other types of sensory tissue and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer ‘gate’ each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules. In the long term, the advances made in this study may lead to new strategies for repairing damaged sensory nerves.
The study of protein quality control (QC) is important for understanding how cells maintain their function and health. In this study, the authors investigate the QC of mitochondrial proteins in yeast. They find that a specific type of protein, called a peripheral membrane protein, is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in a way that is different from the degradation of other types of proteins. The authors also identify the specific proteins and processes involved in this unique QC pathway. This study provides new insights into how cells maintain their function and health.
 In this study, the authors used a biosensor to visualize epidermal ERK activity in living mice. They found that ERK activity propagated from cell to cell in a radial wave pattern, which they called Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD). The frequency of SPREAD was associated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREAD was stimulated by the mitotic stimulant 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as a trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge. The authors also found that SPREAD was associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Their findings provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronized in a living tissue.
Circadian rhythms are biological oscillations that occur in a roughly 24-hour cycle. These rhythms are driven by an internal clock and are influenced by external cues, such as light and temperature. Scientists have long known that circadian rhythms change in response to different environmental conditions, but they have not fully understood how these rhythms adapt to different day lengths. In this study, researchers used a mathematical model to predict how the circadian rhythm of a cyanobacterium, a type of photosynthetic bacteria, would change in response to different day lengths. They found that the rhythm of the cyanobacterium scales linearly with day length, meaning that it tracks midday across different day lengths. This finding suggests that circadian rhythms may be able to adapt to different environmental conditions by simply changing the phase of the rhythm. This study provides important insights into how circadian rhythms may be able to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
 The heart is a vital organ that pumps blood throughout the body. However, the origins of heart disease are often unclear. In this study, researchers found that a protein called Meis1 plays a role in the development of the heart. Meis1 is important for the development of sympathetic neurons, which are responsible for controlling the heart's rhythm. The researchers found that Meis1 is necessary for the development of sympathetic neurons, and that without Meis1, the sympathetic neurons die. This leads to a disruption in the heart's rhythm and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The researchers also found that Meis1 is important for the development of endosomes, which are small structures inside cells that help transport molecules. Without Meis1, the endosomes do not develop properly, which also leads to a disruption in the heart's rhythm. This study provides important insights into the development of the heart and the causes of heart disease.
Bacteria can form complex communities called biofilms that can be found in many natural environments, such as on the surface of rocks or in water. These biofilms can have a variety of shapes and sizes, and scientists are trying to understand how they form. One way that scientists are studying biofilm formation is by using a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. They are using a combination of mechanical measurements, theory, and computer simulations to understand how the mechanical properties of the biofilm and the surface it is attached to affect its shape. They found that the biofilm can go through different stages of development, including wrinkling and delamination, which are caused by mechanical instabilities. They also found that the interfaces between the biofilm and the surface it is attached to play a key role in shaping the biofilm. Overall, their findings suggest that the mechanical properties of the biofilm and the surface it is attached to are important for its shape and development.
 Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. The mechanisms underlying the development of epileptic neuronal networks are unknown. In this study, the authors found that the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF/REST), a transcription factor that influences neuronal phenotype, is upregulated in mature hippocampus following seizures. However, only a subset of potential NRSF target genes were repressed by the increased NRSF levels. The authors used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gene set enrichment analysis to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. They found that genes regulated by NRSF were characterized by mid-range NRSF-binding probabilities during the naive state, enabling a significant increase of NRSF binding to these genes upon modest increases in NRSF tissue levels. NRSF-regulated hippocampal genes included ion channels, receptors, calcium-related molecules, and other transcription factors that govern neuronal function and plasticity, suggesting that their repression might contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
 The olfactory system is responsible for detecting and interpreting odors. It is made up of many different types of neurons that work together to process the information received from the nose. One of the ways that these neurons communicate with each other is through a process called lateral inhibition. This is where a neuron is inhibited by another neuron that is activated by the same stimulus. Recent research has shown that there are differences in how lateral inhibition works between two types of neurons in the olfactory system, called mitral cells and tufted cells. These differences are thought to be due to the way that these neurons are connected to other neurons in the system. The researchers used a technique called optogenetics to study how lateral inhibition works in these neurons. This allowed them to specifically activate one type of neuron and see how this affected the activity of other neurons. They found that lateral inhibition works differently in mitral cells and tufted cells, and that this difference is likely due to the way that these neurons are connected to other neurons in the system. The researchers then used computer simulations to explore how these differences in lateral inhibition might affect how the olfactory system processes odors. They found that the differences in lateral inhibition between mitral cells and tufted cells allow the olfactory system to better distinguish between different odors. Overall, this research provides new insights into how the olfactory system processes information and highlights the importance of understanding how different types of neurons work together to perform complex tasks.
 The M2 muscarinic receptor is a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is involved in the regulation of the nervous system. It has an allosteric site that can be activated by certain ligands, which can then affect the binding of other ligands at the orthosteric site. The study by Wang et al. aimed to understand the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allostery in the M2 muscarinic receptor. They compared the allosteric properties of monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor using a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed that allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending upon the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and they arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations. The study provides a direct demonstration of how allosteric effects characteristic of M2 receptors arise from interactions between the constituent protomers of an oligomer.
 Histone modifications play a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by regulating the recruitment and activation of DDR factors. In this study, the authors found that SETD2, an enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and for the recruitment of RAD51 presynaptic filaments during homologous recombination repair of DSBs. SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling and decreased cell survival after DNA damage. The authors propose that SETD2 acts as a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In ccRCC, loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53.
 The study investigates the role of a missense mutation in the Rasgrp1 gene, which encodes a protein that plays a role in the development of T cells in the thymus. The mutation, called Rasgrp1Anaef, was found in a mouse strain that developed autoantibodies and had an increased population of a certain type of T cell. The researchers found that the mutation caused an increase in a type of signaling called mTOR signaling, which is important for the development of T cells. They also found that reducing mTOR signaling in Rasgrp1Anaef mice normalized the development of T cells and reduced the population of the abnormal type of T cell. The study suggests that missense mutations in genes that play important roles in the development of T cells could lead to autoimmune diseases.
 The SWI/SNF complex is a group of proteins that help control how genes are expressed in cells. Mutations in these proteins are common in many types of cancer, but it is not clear how these mutations affect cancer development. To study this, researchers used a mouse model to look at how changes in one of these proteins, called Arid1a, affect the development of pancreatic cancer. They found that changes in Arid1a can either promote or prevent the development of pancreatic cancer, depending on when the changes happen and what other genetic changes are present. This suggests that the effects of changes in SWI/SNF complex proteins on cancer development may depend on the specific context and timing of the changes.
 The human brain is incredibly complex and has evolved to handle a wide range of tasks. However, it is not always clear how different parts of the brain work together to accomplish these tasks. One way to study this is by looking at how different parts of the brain communicate with each other. This can be done by measuring the electrical activity of different parts of the brain and seeing how they are connected.  In this study, researchers used a technique called optogenetics to study how different parts of the brain communicate with each other. Optogenetics allows researchers to turn specific parts of the brain on or off using light. By doing this, researchers can see how different parts of the brain work together when they are turned on or off.  The researchers focused on a part of the brain called the hippocampus. The hippocampus is important for memory and learning. Researchers used optogenetics to turn on or off a specific part of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus. When the dentate gyrus was turned on, researchers saw increased activity in another part of the brain called the entorhinal cortex. When the dentate gyrus was turned off, researchers saw decreased activity in the entorhinal cortex.  These findings suggest that the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex work together to process information. This is important because it helps researchers understand how different parts of the brain work together to accomplish tasks. This knowledge could be used to develop new treatments for brain disorders.
 In this study, the authors propose that the affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to hemoglobin (Hb) reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptions that optimized tissue oxygen delivery. They derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ describing this relation. They found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. The authors suggest that the values of both p50 and nH of Hb have been tuned during evolution so as to tailor tissue oxygen delivery to the particular metabolic requirements of vertebrates due to variations in body size, lifestyle, and/or environmental conditions. Their findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. The generality and implications of their findings are discussed.
 Malaria is a disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. Once inside the human body, the parasite travels to the liver and then to the bloodstream, where it causes damage to red blood cells. Scientists have been studying how the parasite moves through the skin after it is injected by a mosquito, and they have found that it exhibits two types of motility: fast, unconstrained movement far from blood vessels, and slower, more constrained movement near blood vessels. The scientists also found that the parasite's ability to move near blood vessels is important for its ability to infect humans. They used mutant parasites that were unable to move normally near blood vessels, and found that these parasites were less able to infect humans. This suggests that the parasite's ability to move near blood vessels is important for its ability to cause malaria.
 In this study, the authors evolved yeast cells for 1000 generations without a key gene involved in cell polarization. Despite the absence of this gene, the cells were able to adapt and improve their polarization over time. The authors found that this improvement was due to a specific sequence of mutations in other genes involved in polarization. These mutations allowed the cells to compensate for the loss of the key gene and improve their ability to polarize. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how cells evolve and adapt to changing environments.
 Neurobiologists have studied decisions by offering successive, independent choices between goods or gambles. However, choices often have lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. Here, humans decided whether to commit (by acceptance or rejection) to prospects that provided sustained financial return. BOLD signals in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. By contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected (or deferred accepting) a prospect. dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases--to defer commitments to later and to weight potential losses more heavily than gains--that (paradoxically) maximised reward in this task. These findings offer fresh insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex.
 Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies that contain long non-coding RNA and RNA-binding proteins. They are believed to control gene expression by retaining mRNAs in the nucleus. In this study, the authors found that paraspeckles in rat pituitary cells have a circadian expression pattern. They also found that inserting an inverted repeat of an Alu sequence into the 3’-UTR of a reporter gene led to rhythmic nuclear retention of the mRNA and protein expression. The authors suggest that paraspeckles may play a role in circadian gene expression.
 The protein Munc13 is essential for chemical synaptic transmission and plays a central role in the process of exocytosis, which is the release of neurotransmitters from nerve cells. Munc13 interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), which are responsible for the rapid elevation of intracellular calcium in the vicinity of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles. The authors of this study have identified a pair of basic residues in the C2B domain of Munc13 that are critical for this interaction. They have shown that eliminating this interaction by either removing Munc13 or replacing it with a Munc13 C2B mutant alters synaptic VGCCs' response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and alters calcium influx from single action potential stimuli. These findings suggest that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis.
 The shape of plant cells is determined by a complex interplay of factors, including mechanical stress. The authors propose that puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of plants are an adaptation to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall. They use computer simulations to show that actively minimizing force leads to the emergence of puzzle cell shapes, reducing stress and potentially lowering the amount of cellulose and other wall material required to maintain mechanical integrity of the cell wall. This could be a way for plants to conserve resources and adapt to their environment.
 Splicing is the process by which the introns of a gene are removed and the exons are joined together to form a functional protein. This process is carried out by the spliceosome, a large complex of proteins and RNA molecules. In humans, most genes have multiple introns, and the spliceosome must navigate through these introns to correctly join the exons. To do this, the spliceosome uses a combination of cross-intron and cross-exon interactions. Cross-intron interactions occur when the spliceosome interacts with the intron on one side of the exon with the intron on the other side of the exon. Cross-exon interactions occur when the spliceosome interacts with the exon on one side of the intron with the exon on the other side of the intron. In this study, the authors used single-molecule spectroscopy to investigate how these two types of interactions work together to promote the formation of the spliceosome. They found that cross-intron and cross-exon interactions work together to increase the rate and efficiency of spliceosome formation. This is important because it helps ensure that the spliceosome correctly joins the exons and removes the introns. Overall, this study provides important insights into how the spliceosome navigates through complex pre-mRNA molecules to correctly join the exons and remove the introns.
 Membrane proteins are essential for many cellular processes, but they are often difficult to fold correctly. To help with this, cells use a variety of enzymes and chaperones. In this study, the authors discovered a new way that cells help membrane proteins fold. They found that a protein called LRP6, which is important for the Wnt signaling pathway, is helped to fold by a process called ubiquitination. This process involves adding a small protein called ubiquitin to another protein. The authors found that this process helps LRP6 fold correctly, and that without it, LRP6 is more likely to be misfolded and degraded. They also found that this process helps other membrane proteins fold correctly. This new understanding of how cells help membrane proteins fold could lead to new ways to treat diseases caused by problems with membrane protein folding.
 Sex differences in cognitive processes could contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders . However, sex differences in cognitive task performance can be difficult to detect. Computational tools can help uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. In a classic value-based decision making task, male and female mice had similar accuracy but achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, while female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration. These results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major organelle in the cell that helps with protein folding and transport. When a protein is misfolded or damaged, it is removed from the ER by a process called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). ERAD involves the ubiquitination of the misfolded protein, which then moves to the cytosol where it is degraded by the proteasome. The movement of the protein from the ER to the cytosol is called retrotranslocation. In this study, the authors used a reconstituted system with purified proteins from yeast to investigate the role of the protein Doa10 in retrotranslocation. They found that Doa10 is a retrotranslocase that facilitates the movement of the protein from the ER to the cytosol. The authors also found that Doa10 works with the Cdc48 ATPase to unfold the protein before it moves to the cytosol. This study provides important insights into the mechanism of retrotranslocation and the role of Doa10 in this process.
 Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling is a crucial developmental process that helps cells decide their fate. In Drosophila, Hh signaling is mediated by the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus ( Ci ). Ci can be processed into a repressor form ( Ci-75 ) or remain in its full-length form ( Ci-155 ). In this study, the authors used processing-resistant Ci variants to investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to Hh signaling. They found that Ci-155 processing is not necessary for Hh signaling, as processing-resistant Ci variants could still support normal Hh signaling. They also found that Hh signaling can be activated by the kinase activity of Smoothened ( Smo ) alone, without the need for Cos2 or PKA. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of Hh signaling and may help in understanding the development of diseases caused by abnormal Hh signaling.
The spinal cord is a critical area in sensory processing, and understanding the neuronal circuits in this region is essential for developing treatments for pain. In this study, the authors used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR). They found that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, and directly relay signals to lamina I projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in a significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused a conditioned place aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. These results suggest that dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a future analgesic target.
Rab23 is a protein that helps control the movement of molecules within cells. Mutations in the gene that makes Rab23 can cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. To understand how Rab23 works, researchers made mice that don't have Rab23. These mice have some of the same features as people with Carpenter Syndrome, including polysyndactyly (having extra fingers or toes) and craniosynostosis (premature fusion of bones in the skull). The researchers found that the lack of Rab23 leads to changes in the levels of certain proteins that are important for bone growth. They also found that blocking the changes in protein levels can help prevent craniosynostosis. This suggests that Rab23 plays an important role in bone growth and that it could be a target for new treatments for genetic disorders like Carpenter Syndrome.
 Inheritance of gene expression states is important for cells to remember past events, such as environmental or developmental cues. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a conserved protein complex that maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants. PRC2 modifies chromatin at its targets by adding a methyl group to histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me). It has been proposed that H3K27me on inherited histones could recruit PRC2 to daughter DNA strands in order to similarly modify newly incorporated, unmodified histones. However, it is unclear whether this is the case. To address this question, the authors used the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis. Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure and is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor FLC. The authors found that two copies of the same DNA sequence can be independently maintained in different transcriptional states in the same nucleus. This suggests that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can store epigenetic memory.
 The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a crucial organelle in the cell that processes and folds proteins. When the ER is overwhelmed with too many proteins to process, it becomes stressed and can no longer function properly. To cope with this stress, the cell can either increase the production of ER chaperones or decrease the production of client proteins. One way that the cell can decrease the production of client proteins is through a process called ADP ribosylation. This process involves adding a chemical group called ADP ribose to a protein, which inactivates it. Another way that the cell can decrease the production of client proteins is through a process called AMPylation. This process involves adding a chemical group called AMP to a protein, which also inactivates it. Both ADP ribosylation and AMPylation are important for the cell to cope with ER stress, but they can also be reversed to allow the cell to increase its production of ER chaperones and client proteins. In this study, the authors used a chemical probe to investigate the structure and function of ER chaperones called BiP. They found that BiP can form oligomers, which are groups of multiple BiP molecules that work together to process and fold proteins. The authors also found that the oligomers are inactive, which means that they cannot process and fold proteins. However, the oligomers can be converted back to active BiP molecules, which allows the cell to increase its production of ER chaperones and client proteins. This study provides important insights into how the cell copes with ER stress and how ER chaperones can be regulated to function properly.
 Flexible filamentous viruses are plant pathogens that cause significant economic losses in agriculture. These viruses have a helical coat protein (CP) that protects a single-stranded RNA genome. The structure of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a representative of the genus Potexvirus, has been determined at 3.9 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure of PepMV CP and its interactions with the viral RNA have been modeled, revealing a surprising similarity with the nucleoprotein (NP) of the genus Phlebovirus. This suggests a horizontal gene transfer event between these evolutionarily distant groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses.
 The location of an epitope on a cell surface can determine the immunological outcome of a host-target interaction . However, traditional methods for epitope identification are costly, time-consuming, and unsuited for high-throughput analysis. In this study, the authors developed a new method called SiteLoc for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular surface proteins. This method uses topological image averaging to achieve nanometer-scale resolution and can be applied to other molecular distance estimations. The authors tested the method on simulated images, DNA probes on erythrocytes, and known binding sites on bacterial surfaces. The results show that SiteLoc is well suited for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells. The authors also applied SiteLoc to determine known binding sites on bacterial surfaces and widefield images with and without deconvolution. Overall, SiteLoc is a fast and efficient method for epitope identification that can be used to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.
 The skin is a complex organ that plays a vital role in regulating body temperature and protecting the body from external threats. It also responds to changes in oxygen availability, which can affect the entire body. In this study, researchers used radio-telemetry to monitor the cardiovascular response of mice to hypoxia. They found that the response was tri-modal, with an initial tachycardia and hypertensive phase, followed by a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and finally a recovery to close to a normoxic state. The researchers also found that peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin played an essential role in this systemic cardiovascular response. This study highlights the importance of peripheral tissues in regulating the body's response to hypoxia.
The brain is made up of many different types of neurons that communicate with each other to make us think, feel, and move. To understand how these neurons work together, scientists need to map the connections between them. Optogenetics is a powerful tool that allows scientists to control the activity of individual neurons using light. However, it can be difficult to control the activity of just one neuron when many neurons are close together. In this study, the authors developed a new way to use optogenetics to control the activity of single neurons with more precision. They did this by using a special type of light that expands in the imaging plane and restricting the optogenetic protein to the soma and proximal dendrites of the neuron. This allowed them to reliably evoke action potentials in individual neurons and determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. The authors' new method will help scientists better understand how neurons work together and how different parts of the brain are connected.
 The transcription factors ( TFs ) Sox2 and Oct4 are important for the development of the early embryo.  Previous research has shown that these TFs bind to DNA in a specific order, with Sox2 binding first.  However, new research has shown that this order is not fixed and can vary depending on the context.  The authors of this research used single-molecule techniques to track the movement of these TFs in living cells and found that they do not always bind in the same order.  The authors then developed a mathematical model to explain this behavior and found that it is possible for the TFs to bind in a negative reciprocal order, meaning that the binding of one TF decreases the binding of the other.  This finding suggests that the interaction between these TFs is more complex than previously thought and that they may be working together in a more nuanced way to regulate gene expression.  This research has important implications for our understanding of the development of the early embryo and the role of TFs in regulating gene expression.
10.7554/eLife.13133.001We show that Drosophila melanogaster can detect LPS, a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, using a gustatory mechanism that relies on dTRPA1 channels. These channels are expressed in a subset of Gr66a-expressing neurons in the esophagus and proboscis. LPS stimulates these neurons in vitro and in vivo, and dTRPA1 is necessary for this response. Our findings suggest that Drosophila may use a gustatory mechanism to detect and avoid LPS-contaminated food, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals.
 The immune system is responsible for protecting the body from harmful pathogens and foreign substances. T cells are a type of immune cell that help to fight off infections. In order for T cells to function properly, they need to go through a process of maturation in the thymus. This process involves many stages and is regulated by a variety of genes. In this study, the authors identified a new gene that is important for the maturation of T cells in the thymus. They found that this gene, called Zfp335, is a transcription factor that helps to regulate the expression of other genes that are important for T cell maturation. The authors also found that Zfp335 is important for the survival of mature T cells after they leave the thymus. This study provides important new information about how T cells mature and function.
 The relationship between the abundance of mRNA and protein is not always straightforward. In fact, mRNA and protein levels are often imperfectly correlated. This discrepancy can be explained by several factors, including codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. In this study, the authors present a new factor that they call "mRNA:ncRNA avoidance" and provide evidence that it increases translational efficiency. They also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, the authors show that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. One of the earliest signs of ALS is the loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), which are the connections between motor neurons and muscle fibers. It is not clear whether the loss of NMJs is due to a global degeneration of motor neurons or a localized process. Using in vivo imaging of single motor neurons and their NMJs, the authors found that the loss of NMJs is an asynchronous process, with some NMJs being lost before others. This suggests that localized processes may play a role in the loss of NMJs. The authors also found that the loss of NMJs is not due to a sudden global degeneration of motor neurons, but rather a complex process of continuous denervation and new innervation. These findings suggest that NMJs may be a therapeutic target in ALS.
 Tamoxifen is a widely used drug for treating breast cancer, but it can also cause negative side effects such as hot flashes, bone loss, and fatigue. These side effects are thought to be caused by changes in the hypothalamus-POA, a region of the brain that is highly enriched for estrogen receptor expression. In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus-POA of mice that were treated with tamoxifen. They found that tamoxifen treatment induced widespread changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus-POA, and that these changes were dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). The authors also found that ERα-deficient mice did not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. These findings suggest that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice, and that understanding the mechanisms of tamoxifen action in the hypothalamus-POA could lead to the design of new or adjuvant therapies that circumvent the side effects of tamoxifen therapy.
 Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning and other serious infections. To fight off Listeria, the body produces a type of protein called interferon-stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ). ISG15 is a type of protein that can be attached to other proteins, which can change their function. In this study, the authors found that ISG15 is produced in large amounts in cells that are infected with Listeria. They also found that this production happens even if the cells are not producing a type of protein called interferon. The authors think that ISG15 may be able to help fight off Listeria by changing the function of proteins that are important for the bacteria to survive in the cell. They used a special type of protein labeling to find out which proteins are being changed by ISG15. They found that many of the proteins that are important for the cell to communicate with other cells are being changed by ISG15. This could be a way for the body to fight off Listeria by changing the way that cells communicate with each other.
 Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer ( smFRET ) is a powerful technique for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the analysis of smFRET data requires multiple layers of preprocessing, including raw image treatment, trace selection, and data analysis. These steps are time-consuming and require human intervention, which can introduce bias. To address this issue, researchers have developed software to automate these steps. However, these software packages are not standardized and require extensive training. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed deep learning algorithms to automate the analysis of smFRET data. These algorithms can learn to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions with high accuracy. In this study, researchers developed an open-source, standalone software package called DeepFRET that uses deep learning algorithms to automate the analysis of smFRET data. DeepFRET can classify traces with high accuracy and output common kinetic information metrics. The software is user-friendly and can be used by researchers with limited programming skills. DeepFRET has the potential to revolutionize the analysis of smFRET data and improve the reproducibility and accuracy of structural biology studies.
 In this study, researchers found that a protein called SCML2 helps Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to repress certain genes. PRC1 is a protein complex that helps control gene expression. SCML2 is a protein that helps PRC1 to repress certain genes. SCML2 has a region that binds to RNA molecules and a region that binds to chromatin. Deleting the region that binds to RNA molecules reduces the ability of SCML2 to repress certain genes. This suggests that RNA molecules play a role in helping SCML2 to repress certain genes. The researchers also found that SCML2 helps PRC1 to repress certain genes by binding to it. This suggests that SCML2 helps PRC1 to repress certain genes by physically interacting with it. Overall, this study provides new insights into how PRC1 is regulated and how it helps control gene expression.
70 years ago, scientists discovered that the ribosome, the cell's protein factory, can stall during translation. This stalling is important for regulating protein synthesis and can be induced by specific sequences of amino acids in the ribosome-interacting protein. In this study, researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the ribosome stalled by a specific sequence of amino acids in the protein SecM. They found that the ribosome stalls at two different stages of translation, and that this stalling is caused by interactions between the ribosome and the amino acid sequence in SecM. These findings provide new insights into how ribosomes regulate protein synthesis.
 The human eye is a complex organ that allows us to see the world around us. The retina, a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye, contains photoreceptor cells called cones and rods that detect light and convert it into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. The density of these photoreceptor cells varies across the retina, with the highest density found at the fovea, the central part of the visual field. Researchers have long been interested in how the density of these cells changes as the eye grows in length. In this study, the authors used a new generation of Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. They found that the foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching ( decrease in cones/mm2 ) , myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density ( increase in cones/deg2 ) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes , offering the potential for better visual acuity. The authors discuss the physical and visual implications of their findings and compare them to previous studies. They conclude that their results suggest that myopes may have an advantage in terms of visual acuity compared to emmetropes, despite having a lower linear cone density.
 Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here, we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other significant locus effects (7%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.
KCNQ1 is a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a crucial role in the heart, inner ear, and kidney. It is paired with the accessory subunit KCNE1, which modulates its gating behavior. The stoichiometry of the binding between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 has been controversial, with some studies reporting a ratio of two β-subunits to every four α-subunits, while others suggest a more flexible stoichiometry. In this study, the authors used fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one, two, or four KCNQ1 subunits to reproduce compulsory 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed that EQQ and EQQQQ had increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ, all abolished by the addition of KCNE1. As well, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, the authors found that EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates were progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, which demonstrates that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex. These findings support the variable stoichiometry model for channel complex assembly.
 The zebrafish is a powerful model for studying tissue regeneration because it exhibits high regenerative capacity. In a previous study, we found that myeloid-defective zebrafish mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin fold regeneration . Here, we found that the apoptosis phenotype is induced by prolonged expression of interleukin 1 beta ( il1b ). Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal source of Il1b, but we show that epithelial cells express il1b in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response, and that its resolution by macrophages is necessary for survival of regenerative cells. We further show that Il1b plays an essential role in normal fin fold regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study reveals that proper levels of Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration.
 The cytoplasm of cells is crowded with macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. These molecules interact with each other, and the nature of these interactions can affect the diffusion of molecules in the cytoplasm. In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between the diffusion coefficient of proteins and their surface properties. They used fluorescently labeled proteins with different charges and distributions of charges, and measured their diffusion coefficients in the cytoplasm of three different organisms: Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii. They found that the diffusion coefficient of proteins decreased as the protein charge increased, and that this effect was weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The authors suggest that the interaction of positively charged proteins with ribosomes may limit their diffusion in the cytoplasm. This finding has implications for the functioning of prokaryotic endosymbionts, which may have different cytoplasmic environments that affect the diffusion of proteins.
 In the past, scientists have been able to regenerate body parts in animals such as planarians, but they have not been able to figure out how this happens. In this study, the authors found a protein called Smed-follistatin that is required for planarian regeneration. They also found two other proteins called Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2 that are required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. Finally, they found that Smed-follistatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. These findings suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence and identify a mechanism critical for regeneration initiation. This is important because regeneration is widespread across the animal kingdom and understanding the mechanisms behind it could lead to new treatments for injuries and diseases.
 Mismatch repair (MMR) is a process that helps cells repair errors made during DNA replication. Defects in MMR can lead to the development of certain types of cancer, including endometrial and colorectal cancer. Researchers have used whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to study the mutation patterns in MMR-deficient tumors and found that they have a distinct mutation signature that is similar to germ-line DNA. This suggests that a significant fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations that escape MMR. The researchers also identified a set of recurrent indels that can be used to detect microsatellite instability, which is a hallmark of MMR deficiency. They optimized a novel marker set that is more specific and selective than standard MSI tests. Additionally, the researchers found that recurrent indels are enriched for the DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination pathway. This led them to test the sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers. They found that MMR-deficient tumors are more sensitive to DSB inducers than normal cells, which could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating MMR-deficient tumors.
Optogenetics is a powerful tool for controlling biological processes in a precise and non-invasive manner. It involves the use of light to control the activity of proteins that have been genetically engineered to respond to light. This allows researchers to manipulate the behavior of cells and organisms in real-time. However, current optogenetic tools have limitations that make them difficult to use in certain applications. In this study, the authors developed a new type of optogenetic tool called enhanced Magnets (eMags) that overcomes these limitations. They engineered two new components that are more stable and have higher dimerization efficiency than the original Magnets components. They then validated the eMags by using them to control the behavior of proteins in cells. The eMags are a powerful new tool that will allow researchers to control biological processes with greater precision and flexibility.
 The process of translation, in which the genetic code is read and proteins are made, is tightly regulated. One way this happens is through the phosphorylation of eIF2α, which controls the initiation of translation. In a new study, researchers found that the eIF2α kinase GCN2 is activated in response to ribosome stalling, a process in which ribosomes pause during translation. This activation of GCN2 leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the expression of genes involved in stress response. The researchers also found that GCN2 activation attenuates neurodegeneration in a mouse model with ribosome stalling. These findings suggest that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation.
 The study analyzed 1472 population-based studies with measurement of height on more than 18.6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.5–22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3–19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8–144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries. Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and higher risk of some cancers. There is also evidence that taller people on average have higher education, earnings, and possibly even social position. Although height is one of the most heritable human traits, cross-population differences are believed to be related to non-genetic, environmental factors. Information on height and its trends can therefore help understand the health impacts of childhood and adolescent nutrition and environment, and of their social, economic, and political determinants on both non-communicable diseases and on neonatal health and survival in the next generation.
 Opioid overdose is a major public health problem in the United States and around the world. Opioids slow breathing, which can lead to death. Scientists have found that a small group of neurons in the brainstem are responsible for this effect. These neurons are part of the breathing circuit, which is where the rhythm of breathing comes from. The scientists used genetic tools to identify these neurons and found that they are not needed for opioid-induced analgesia, which is the pain-relieving effect of opioids. This means that drugs that target these neurons could be used to treat opioid overdose without affecting pain relief.
 The human hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is a major public health problem worldwide. It is believed that the large envelope protein of HBV interacts with a cellular receptor to enter human liver cells. In this study, the authors used a combination of biochemical and virological approaches to identify the receptor for HBV. They found that the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide ( NTCP ), a multiple transmembrane transporter expressed in the liver, specifically interacts with the large envelope protein of HBV and functions as a receptor for both HBV and its satellite virus, HDV. The authors also found that replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability to support both viral infections. These findings suggest that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV and that it may be a potential target for the development of new treatments for HBV-related diseases.
 Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection becomes overactive and damages its own tissues. Memory CD8 T cells are important for the body's response to infection and play a key role in controlling sepsis. However, it is not clear how memory CD8 T cells recover after sepsis and whether they are able to function properly. In this study, the authors used samples from septic patients and experimental models to investigate how memory CD8 T cells recover after sepsis. They found that memory CD8 T cells from septic patients and mice after CLP-induced sepsis proliferate more than those from non-septic controls. This increased proliferation leads to changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape, which in turn affects the localization, function, and protective capacity of pre-existing memory CD8 T cells. These findings suggest that sepsis can have long-lasting effects on memory CD8 T cells and may contribute to the immunoparalysis state that occurs after sepsis.
 Long INterspersed Element-1 ( LINE-1 or L1 ) is a type of DNA that makes up about 17% of the human genome. It is called "long" because it is about 6,000 base pairs long. However, most of the L1 DNA in the human genome is broken, rearranged, or inactivated and cannot move to new locations in the genome. There are about 80 to 100 active L1s in the human genome that can move to new locations. These active L1s can cause genetic diseases if they move to the wrong location. To prevent this, the human body has evolved ways to stop L1s from moving. One of these ways is through a protein called APOBEC3A ( A3A ). A3A can stop L1s from moving by deaminating, or changing, the DNA. However, it was not clear how A3A did this. In this study, the researchers used an in vitro assay to show that A3A can stop L1s from moving by deaminating the single-stranded DNA that is made during the process of L1 integration. This means that when A3A is present, the single-stranded DNA is changed, which stops the L1 from moving to a new location. This provides a mechanism for how A3A can stop L1s from moving.
 Sensory experience plays a crucial role in shaping neural circuits by affecting the synaptic connectivity and intrinsic properties of individual neurons. Identifying the molecules responsible for converting external stimuli into altered neuronal output is essential for understanding experience-dependent plasticity and circuit function. In this study, the authors investigated the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity. They found that Rem2-/- mice fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, the authors established a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons prior to changes in synaptic function. Consistent with these findings, both in vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. Taken together, the authors demonstrated that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.
The Earth's magnetic field is a fundamental force of nature that has been studied extensively in the past. However, recent studies have suggested that magnetic fields may also play a role in biological systems, such as in the navigation of animals and in the control of cell activity. These claims have been met with skepticism, as they conflict with basic laws of physics. The author argues that these claims are not supported by the evidence and that the proposed mechanisms are unlikely to be effective. The author suggests that future research should focus on developing new methods for studying the effects of magnetic fields on biological systems, rather than relying on existing theories.
 Stem cells are important for tissue repair and regeneration, but they can also become cancer stem cells that cause tumors. Understanding how stem cells switch between different states is important for developing treatments. Drosophila neuroblasts are a good model for studying stem cells because they can be easily manipulated and their behavior is well understood. In this study, the authors found that when neuroblasts enter a quiescent state, a protein called Prospero is detected in the nucleus for a short time. This protein is important for differentiation, and the authors found that a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating neuroblasts into quiescence. They also found that loss of Prospero prevents neuroblasts from entering quiescence. The authors propose that Prospero levels can distinguish three different states of neuroblasts: absence of Prospero for self-renewal, low levels of Prospero for quiescence, and high levels of Prospero for differentiation. This study provides important insights into how stem cells switch between different states.
 HIV-1 is a virus that causes AIDS. It has a protein shell called the capsid that protects its genetic material. When the virus enters a cell, the capsid must disassemble to release the genetic material. Scientists have developed a new method to study the disassembly of HIV-1 capsids in real-time. They used fluorescence microscopy to observe the disassembly of hundreds of individual capsids. They found that the disassembly process can be divided into two distinct steps: capsid opening and lattice disassembly. They also found that different drugs and host molecules can affect these two steps differently. This new method will help scientists better understand how HIV-1 disassembles and how drugs can affect this process.
 The JNK signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and survival. It has been implicated in the development of various cancers, including breast cancer. However, the role of JNK in breast cancer development is not well understood. In this study, the authors used a mouse model to investigate the effects of JNK deficiency on breast cancer development. They found that loss of JNK signaling caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Furthermore, JNK deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. These effects of JNK deficiency were associated with widespread presence of early neoplasia and genomic instability. The authors conclude that JNK plays a key role in the initiation of tumor development and that the frequent loss-of-function JNK pathway mutations in breast tumors represent 'driver' mutations that promote breast cancer development.
 The study of cilia, tiny hair-like organelles that protrude from the surface of many cells, has been a topic of interest for many years. These organelles are involved in a variety of important cellular functions, including sensing, signaling, and movement. However, the mechanisms that control the biogenesis of cilia are not fully understood. In this study, the authors investigated the role of a protein called peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) in cilia biogenesis. They found that PAM is required for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in multiple cell types, including Chlamydomonas, planaria, and mice. The authors also found that PAM is present in the Golgi and cilia of these cells, and that it has a strong biochemical association with the axonemal superstructure of cilia. These findings suggest that PAM plays a key conserved role during the early steps of ciliogenesis, and that it is involved in a novel link between amidation and cilium assembly.
 The protein Myo3 is important for the development and maintenance of hair cells in the ear. It interacts with another protein called Espin1 to help build actin fibers that make up the hair cells. Myo3 has a special part called the THDI that helps it bind to Espin1. Scientists have now found that Myo3 has two parts within the THDI that can bind to Espin1 separately. They have also found that Myo3 can help Espin1 build stronger actin fibers. This discovery could help scientists understand how Myo3 and Espin1 work together to build the hair cells in the ear.
 Voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs) are important for many cell functions, such as muscle contraction and nerve transmission. These channels are made up of four repeating units, each with its own voltage-sensing domain (VSD). The VSDs are responsible for sensing changes in voltage and opening the channel. Scientists have been studying the structure and function of CaVs for many years, but they still don't fully understand how the VSDs work. In this study, scientists used a combination of computer modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to study the structure and function of the VSDs of CaV1.1. They found that the VSDs have different structures and that the way they move in response to changes in voltage is different. This helps to explain why different CaV isoforms have different properties. The study provides new insights into how VSDs work and how they contribute to the function of CaV channels.
 The ability of the adult brain to undergo plastic changes is important for recovery from injuries or improving learning and cognition. Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) have been associated with juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex ( V1 ) plasticity, but their role in this process in the adult V1 is not well understood. In this study, the authors examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stoke-affected adult mice. They found that MMP-inhibition prevented visual plasticity in healthy animals, but rescued plasticity once lost due to stroke. These results suggest that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors are found at excitatory synapses throughout the mammalian brain, where they convert glutamate release into membrane depolarization. These receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that consist of three layers formed from distinct domains. The two extracellular layers assemble from amino-terminal domains and ligand-binding domains, ATDs and LBDs, respectively. These dimers pack around a central twofold symmetry axis that switches into fourfold symmetry in the transmembrane ion channel layer. Using bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers, the authors calibrated the conformations found in functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. Their data indicate that extracellular domains of AMPA receptors can get trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Thus, under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, extracellular domains of AMPA receptors likely stay compact during gating. The authors suggest that AMPA receptors at synapses probably have similar, compact geometries regardless of their instantaneous gating state.
 The intestine is a complex tissue that plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption and immune defense. However, it is difficult to isolate immune cells from the intestine due to the strong anti-parasite immune response that drives mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration. In this study, the authors developed a standard intestinal digestion protocol that allowed them to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum of mice. They then used high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to validate that these cells gave an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. This new protocol has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible.
20S proteasomes are responsible for the degradation of most cellular proteins. They are composed of four stacked rings of seven subunits each, and have two antechambers and a central catalytic chamber. The proteasome is a dynamic enzyme, and its activity varies over time due to interactions between substrates and products, and the proteolytic and regulatory sites. The authors used an iterative experimental and modeling approach to develop a mechanistic model of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The model predicts that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes, thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage. The authors suggest that the model can be used to design better, more discriminatory experiments, and to understand the mechanisms that determine proteasome activity.
β-alanine is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the visual system of Drosophila. It is recycled from the synaptic cleft by laminar glia cells, which then convert it to carcinine. Carcinine is then taken up by photoreceptor cells, where it is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. The recycling of β-alanine is essential for sustained visual synaptic transmission, but the mechanisms by which it is transported and stored are unknown. In this study, the authors identified a new β-alanine transporter, which they named BalaT. They found that BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results provide the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission, and suggest that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission.
 The study by Johnson et al.  in the journal Nature Communications reveals that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse that affects over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. The redox collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, as would have been postulated by the free radical theory of aging. Instead, it appears to be instigated by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH, which normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that is predicted to down-regulate most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a near-universal lifespan extending measure, increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade. The study reveals a time line of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death. The findings of this study suggest that the decrease in cellular NADPH levels is a key event in the aging process and that manipulation of the onset of oxidative stress will alter lifespan.
 The biological macromolecular world is homochiral, meaning that it is composed of only left-handed molecules. This is essential for cell survival, as the presence of right-handed molecules can interfere with the functioning of the cell. To ensure homochirality, cells have evolved mechanisms to remove right-handed molecules. One such mechanism is the action of D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), which removes right-handed amino acids from tRNAs. In this study, the authors present the crystal structure of DTD from Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog. They found that DTD uses an invariant 'cross-subunit' Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral center of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. This allows DTD to act on multiple D-amino acids with strict enantioselectivity, while leaving L-aminoacyl-tRNAs untouched. The study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus.
 The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) is a chloride ion channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients. CFTR is gated by ATP and PKA, and spontaneous openings occur without ATP in certain CFTR mutants. The molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating are unclear. Here, the authors correlate energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. They show that spontaneous openings are also strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are therefore intrinsic to CFTR. This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms.
We have shown that the order–disorder transition in a membrane protein can be described as a first-order transition, and that this transition is accompanied by a large driving force for assembly. This force is due to the orderphobic effect, which is a phenomenon whereby a transmembrane protein that is disordered in the membrane’s ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region in its vicinity. This effect is due to the mismatch between the hydrophobic thickness of the protein and the hydrophobic thickness of the ordered phase. The orderphobic effect is a pre-transition effect for the first-order transition between the ordered and disordered phases, and it is therefore relevant for understanding the behavior of membrane proteins in the vicinity of the phase transition.
 Fluorescent calcium indicators are used to study neural activity in vivo, but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials (APs) is unclear. Most APs can be detected when the soma fills the microscope's field of view, but calcium indicators are used to image populations of neurons, necessitating a large field of view, generating fewer photons per neuron, and compromising AP detection. Here, the authors characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex, with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. While most APs were detected under optimal conditions, under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected (often <10% and ~20–30%, respectively), emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions. The authors provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets.
 The Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla has a unique reproductive system in which females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercively anchor males and obtain semen . The semen is packed in a capsule, which is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition . To compete for semen, the direction of sexual selection is reversed in Neotrogla. The female penis bears a lot of spines, by which females anchor a male coercively during copulation. After consumption of the semen, the empty capsule is detached from the plate, which is kept within the spermatheca. Because females frequently have empty capsules within the spermathecal pouch, female Neotrogla can be considered polyandrous. The morphological reversal of the intromittent organs in Neotrogla seems to require further upstream modifications of the genital system, such as the formation of the spermathecal plate. In this study, the authors used confocal laser scanning microscopy and high-resolution synchrotron microcomputed tomography to investigate the structure of the spermathecal plate. They examined three species of Neotrogla, the spermathecal morphology of which is practically identical. Based on the results, the authors discuss the evolutionary significance of this plate during the evolution of the reversed intromittent organs in Neotrogla.
SNAREs are proteins that mediate the fusion of vesicles with their target membranes, allowing the transfer of materials and information between different cells or cellular compartments. The fusion process requires the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE VAMP2, the plasma-membrane-associated t-SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, and the SM protein Munc18-1. Using optical tweezers, we observed four distinct stages of SNARE assembly in the N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains of the SNARE complex. We found that Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures the t-SNARE C-terminus independent of syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD. Our observations demonstrate distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is intimately chaperoned by Munc18-1.
The integrin adhesome is a complex network of proteins that allows cells to adhere to and move on surfaces. How does this adhesome assemble and maintain its structure? In this study, researchers used fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to investigate the cytosolic state of integrin adhesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol. They found that the integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary focal adhesions release the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, thereby keeping the cytosolic pool of building blocks spatiotemporally uniform. The researchers conclude that multi-protein building blocks enable rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites and that symmetric exchange of these building blocks preserves their specifications and assembly logic. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of integrin adhesome assembly and maintenance.
1/f spectral dynamics are a common feature of brain activity and have been linked to changes in arousal levels. In this study, the authors used intracranial and scalp EEG recordings to investigate the relationship between 1/f spectral dynamics and arousal states in humans. They found that the spectral slope, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, was able to discriminate wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM sleep, and REM sleep. The authors suggest that the spectral slope could be used as a surrogate marker for the excitation to inhibition balance in the brain.
 Stromules are dynamic tubular structures that extend from chloroplasts and have been observed in several plant species. They are involved in various functions such as defense, signaling, and transport. In this study, the authors investigated the role of microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs) in stromule dynamics. They found that MTs are required for stromule extension and movement, while AFs function as anchor points for stromules. The authors also observed a strong correlation between the direction of stromules from chloroplasts and the direction of chloroplast movement. They propose a model in which stromules extend along MTs and connect to AF anchor points surrounding nuclei, facilitating stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts to nuclei during innate immunity. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of stromule dynamics and their functions in plant cells.
50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure were analyzed to determine if residue pairs that covary across protein–protein interfaces are in contact in the complex. The results showed that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood-based method to covary across protein–protein interfaces are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. The method was then used to make subunit contact predictions for an additional 36 protein complexes with unknown structures, and models were presented based on these predictions for four complexes. The findings suggest that residue–residue covariance can be used to predict contacts across protein interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes.
 In this study, researchers used a novel gaze-contingent paradigm to investigate how people scan visual scenes to categorize them. They found that participants' scan paths followed an active sensing strategy that incorporated information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. The researchers also estimated that a major portion of this apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. Their results suggest that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations.
The nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) is a large protein complex that allows molecules to move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It is important for many cellular processes, including gene expression and cell division. However, little is known about how large molecules, such as viruses, are transported through the NPC. In this study, the authors used a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy to investigate the kinetics of nuclear import of large cargo models in permeabilized cells. They found that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. The authors suggest that their results reveal key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells.
 CD28 is a co-stimulatory molecule that is essential for T cell activation. Despite its critical role in T cell activation, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation. To determine the role for CD28 after T cell priming, researchers generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. They show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4+ T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming.
 Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that colonizes the human stomach and can cause stomach ulcers and gastric cancers. Its helical shape is important for efficient colonization of the stomach. The shape of H. pylori is determined by the structure of its peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. The authors used 3D microscopy and metabolic probes to investigate how H. pylori maintains its helical shape. They found that PG synthesis is enhanced at both positive and negative Gaussian curvatures of the cell wall. They also found that the non-redundant, non-essential proteins MreB and CcmA promote PG synthesis at these curvatures. The authors propose that MreB and CcmA help maintain helical shape by patterning PG synthesis. This study provides new insights into how H. pylori maintains its helical shape and how this shape is important for its survival and virulence.
 The protein Cdc48/p97 is a ubiquitin-selective chaperone that helps to regulate the activity of other proteins. In this study, the authors found that Cdc48/p97 plays a role in regulating the fusion of mitochondria, which are organelles in cells that produce energy. The authors discovered that Cdc48/p97 works together with two other proteins, Ubp12 and Ubp2, to control the fusion of mitochondria. The authors found that Cdc48/p97 helps to remove Ubp12 from the mitochondria, which in turn helps to activate Ubp2. Ubp2 then helps to remove a specific type of ubiquitin from a protein called Fzo1, which is important for mitochondrial fusion. The authors also found that Cdc48/p97 helps to stabilize a different type of ubiquitin on Fzo1, which helps to promote mitochondrial fusion. Overall, the authors found that Cdc48/p97 helps to regulate the fusion of mitochondria by working with two other proteins to control the activity of Fzo1.
 The brain is made up of many different regions, each responsible for a specific function. One of these regions is the ventral occipito-temporal cortex ( VOTC ), which is involved in processing visual information. In this study, researchers used fMRI to study how the VOTC processes different types of information in sighted and blind people. They found that the VOTC of blind people processes sound information in a way that is similar to how it processes visual information in sighted people. This suggests that the VOTC may have a more general role in processing information, rather than just visual information. However, there were some differences in how the VOTC processed sound information in blind and sighted people. These differences may be due to the way that the brain adapts to different types of sensory input. Overall, this study provides important insights into how the brain processes different types of information.
The fungus Entomophthora muscae infects flies and causes them to exhibit a series of behaviors before they die. These behaviors include climbing, extending their proboscis, affixing themselves to a surface, and raising their wings. Scientists have been studying this fungus for over a century, but they do not know how it causes these behaviors. In this study, researchers discovered a strain of E. muscae infecting wild Drosophila flies. They established a method to infect D. melanogaster flies in the lab. Lab-infected flies exhibited the same behaviors as wild flies. The researchers found that E. muscae invades the nervous system of the fly, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. They also found that E. muscae secretes specific sets of metabolites in response to being grown with ex vivo dissected brains from its natural hosts. This study provides a new model for understanding how parasites manipulate host behavior.
 RNA degradation is a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression. 30 general RNA degradation factors were studied in yeast using PAR-CLIP, a technique that allows for the identification of RNA-binding proteins. The results revealed that the factors preferentially bind to different RNA classes, such as mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs. The findings also suggest that the degradation of mRNAs is initiated by deadenylation, followed by decapping and 3′→5′ degradation. The study provides a valuable resource for future research on RNA degradation pathways and mechanisms.
 In Arabidopsis thaliana , camalexin is a defense compound that can be rapidly induced by various biotic and abiotic stresses . The expression of camalexin biosynthesis genes is controlled by transcription factors and epigenetic modifications. In this study, the authors found that two epigenetic marks, H3K27me3 and H3K18ac, are enriched at camalexin biosynthesis genes and form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants defective in H3K27me3 and H3K18ac suggested that both modifications are required to determine the timely induction of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression and camalexin accumulation under FLG22 treatment. This study revealed a new type of bivalent chromatin whose function may be to determine the timely induction of defense-compound biosynthesis in response to a pathogen signal.
 The brain is a complex organ that is constantly changing and adapting to new information and experiences. One of the key players in this process are astrocytes, which are star-shaped cells that support and nourish neurons. In the adult brain, some astrocytes retain the ability to generate new neurons, a process known as neurogenesis. However, the mechanisms that allow these astrocytes to maintain this ability are not well understood. In this study, the authors found that a protein called EZH2 is expressed in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse brain. They also found that EZH2 is required for the proper functioning of these NSCs. Specifically, EZH2 is needed for both the proliferation and differentiation of these cells. The authors also found that EZH2 directly regulates the expression of two genes that are important for NSC function. These findings suggest that EZH2 plays a critical role in the maintenance of NSCs in the adult brain. This could have important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.
 The human brain is incredibly complex and is responsible for a wide range of functions, including thinking, feeling, and moving. The brain is made up of many different types of cells, including neurons, which communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. Scientists have been studying the brain for many years, but there is still much that they do not understand about how it works. In recent years, advances in technology have allowed scientists to study the brain in more detail than ever before. For example, they can now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see the structure of the brain and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to see how different parts of the brain are active while a person is thinking or moving. Scientists can also use electroencephalography (EEG) to record the electrical activity of the brain. These technologies have allowed scientists to make many important discoveries about the brain, but there is still much that they do not understand. For example, they do not know exactly how different parts of the brain are connected and how these connections change over time. They also do not know how the brain processes information or how it stores memories. Scientists are working hard to answer these and other important questions about the brain, and they hope that their discoveries will help us better understand ourselves and the world around us.
 Cilia are hair-like organelles that protrude from the surface of cells. They are important for many cellular functions, including movement and sensing. Cilia are made up of microtubules and are assembled and maintained by a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). IFT is a highly conserved mechanism that involves more than 20 proteins. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are mostly unknown. In this study, the authors focused on a putative IFT protein called TTC26/DYF13. They used live imaging and biochemical approaches to show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii produced short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicated that a particular set of proteins involved in motility was specifically depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These results suggest that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery.
 In this study, the authors investigated the mechanisms of lymphatic dissemination in distant metastasis of melanoma. They found that exposure of expansively growing human melanoma cells to lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in 3D co-culture facilitates melanoma distant organ metastasis in mice. The authors established LEC co-cultures with different melanoma cells originating from primary tumors or metastases and found that the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix that was dependent on MMP14, Notch3, and β1-integrin. Moreover, MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation. The authors also found that MMP14 and Notch3 were required for LEC-mediated metastasis of zebrafish xenografts. This study uncovers a unique mechanism whereby LEC contact promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasively sprouting cell phenotype.
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in cells. They are important for many biological processes, including brain development. In this study, researchers used a new approach to study the role of miR-9 in dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in the brain. They developed a transgenic mouse line that allowed them to conditionally inactivate miR-9 in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this approach, they found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. They also discovered that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. This study provides new insights into the role of miRNAs in brain development and function.
 Social visual engagement difficulties are hallmark early signs of autism ( ASD ) and are easily quantified using eye tracking methods . However, it is unclear how these difficulties are linked to atypical early functional brain organization in ASD . With resting state fMRI data in a large sample of ASD toddlers and other non-ASD comparison groups , we find ASD-related functional hypoconnnectivity between ‘social brain’ circuitry such as the default mode network ( DMN ) and visual and attention networks . An eye tracking-identified ASD subtype with pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties ( GeoPref ASD ) is characterized by marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex ( OTC ) hypoconnectivity . Increased DMN-OTC hypoconnectivity is also related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties , but only in GeoPref ASD . Early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals .
 In Drosophila melanogaster , the lymph gland produces two types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. These cells are not released until pupariation, but their numbers increase throughout larval development. It is not known if crystal cells increase by self-renewal or by de novo differentiation. In this study, the authors show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems.
Aneuploidy, or the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a common genetic disorder in humans and can lead to various diseases. However, it is also thought to play a role in evolution by allowing for the rapid development of new traits. In this study, the authors investigated the effects of aneuploidy on gene expression in yeast. They found that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates and that many of these isolates have lower-than-expected expression at amplified genes. The authors then generated diploid strain panels with different numbers of copies of affected chromosomes and found that gene-dosage compensation functions at around 10-30% of amplified genes. This means that the cells are able to compensate for the increased expression of some genes caused by aneuploidy. The authors also found that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009 by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. This study provides a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution.
The human eye is a complex organ that allows us to see the world around us. It is made up of many different types of cells, including photoreceptors, which are specialized cells that detect light and convert it into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. There are two main types of photoreceptors in the human eye: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for detecting low levels of light and do not contribute much to color vision. Cones, on the other hand, are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light conditions. Recent research has shown that there may be a third type of photoreceptor in the human eye, called xenopsins. These photoreceptors are similar to cones in that they can detect color, but they are also sensitive to low levels of light like rods. The discovery of xenopsins has led to new questions about the evolution of photoreceptors and how they function. For example, it is not clear whether xenopsins are present in other animals, or if they have evolved independently in different species. To answer these questions, researchers have been studying xenopsins in a variety of different animals, including flatworms, mollusks, and annelids. By examining the structure and function of xenopsins in these animals, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how these photoreceptors evolved and how they work. Overall, the discovery of xenopsins has opened up a whole new area of research into the evolution and function of photoreceptors. As scientists continue to study these fascinating cells, we may learn even more about how they work and how they have evolved over time.
The authors used Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts ( NB5-6 and NB7-4 ) that make different progeny . Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast , ruling out the independent specification model . Moreover , each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains , which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast . Importantly , the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor , expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4 , had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6 , but not NB7-4 . The authors' data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains , leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage .
 P2X receptors are ion channels that open in response to ATP, a molecule that is released when cells are damaged or stressed. These receptors are important for many cellular processes, including pain perception and inflammation. However, the exact mechanism by which ATP binds to the receptor and causes it to open is not well understood.  Recent crystal structures of the P2X receptor have provided some insight into how ATP binding causes the receptor to open. However, these structures were obtained in the absence of ATP, and it is not clear how the receptor changes when ATP is actually bound.  To address this question, researchers used a technique called photo-switchable cross-linking to monitor the movement of specific amino acid residues in the receptor as it opens in response to ATP. They found that the receptor opens by a process that involves the movement of the outer ends of the transmembrane helices that make up the pore of the receptor.  These findings provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and may help to develop new drugs that target these receptors.
Cytokinesis is the process by which a single cell divides into two daughter cells. It is powered by the contraction of an actomyosin ring that forms around the middle of the cell. In animal cells, this ring is made up of two proteins: myosin-II and formin. Researchers have found that the way these two proteins work together to make the ring varies between different types of cells in the body. They used fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment to identify cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust formin-CYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. In one cell (P2), this cytokinetic variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, EMS. Thus, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened. The findings of this study suggest that cytokinesis failure occurs normally during development and/or homeostasis in some animal cells, and that this failure can be pathogenic in others.
 In nature, bacteria often colonize host tissues and can cause disease. To understand how bacteria interact with their hosts, scientists study the proteins that bacteria produce. Some bacteria produce proteins that can help them survive in the host, while other proteins can trigger the host's immune system to attack the bacteria. In this study, researchers looked at a type of bacteria called Vibrio fischeri, which lives in the light organ of a squid. They found that when the bacteria are flagellated (have a tail), they can trigger the host's immune system to attack them. However, when the bacteria are not flagellated, they can still trigger the host's immune system, but not as strongly. The researchers also found that the bacteria produce a protein called lipopolysaccharide, which can help them survive in the host. When the bacteria are flagellated, they produce more lipopolysaccharide, which helps them survive better in the host. Overall, this study shows that bacteria can use different strategies to interact with their hosts, and that understanding these strategies can help us better understand how bacteria cause disease.
 In the early 1900s, scientists discovered that the chromosomes of fruit flies and other organisms are organized into a specific pattern. This pattern is important for the proper functioning of the cell and for the development of the organism. Scientists have been studying the mechanisms behind this pattern for many years, but there is still much that is not understood. In this study, researchers used a new technique to study the process of chromosome organization in fruit flies. They found that the process is more complex than previously thought and involves multiple steps. The researchers also found that the process is important for the proper functioning of the cell and for the development of the organism. Their findings provide new insights into how chromosomes are organized and how this process is important for the proper functioning of the cell and for the development of the organism.
 Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a common human virus that can cause cancer in certain cases. EBV expresses proteins that promote cell growth and prevent apoptosis ( cell death ). In this study, researchers used a technique called BH3 profiling to determine how EBV-infected B cells survive and grow. They found that EBV-infected B cells have a different way of surviving and growing compared to uninfected B cells. This finding could help develop new treatments for EBV-associated cancers.
Plants produce a diverse array of specialized metabolites to cope with the challenges of complex and ever-changing environments. These metabolites are encoded by multiple genes that are subject to natural selection. However, the genetic and geographic distribution of these genes and their resulting metabolites is not well understood. In this study, the authors measured the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. They found that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography, and different genetic processes all combine to influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. This study provides a new perspective about the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation.
 In a study published in eLife, researchers have shown that caspases, which are proteins that mediate apoptosis, can actually promote tumor growth under certain conditions. The study used a model of cancer in fruit flies to show that when a mutation in a gene called RasV12 is introduced into cells that lack a protein called Scrib, the caspases become activated and promote tumor growth. The researchers found that this effect is due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the caspases, which in turn activate macrophage-like immune cells that signal back to tumor cells to promote tumor growth. The researchers also found that interfering with this feedback loop strongly reduces tumor growth and improves survival in the fruit fly model. These findings suggest that caspases may play a role in promoting tumor growth in humans and that targeting this feedback loop could be a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer.
 We all know that time seems to go by faster when we are doing something we enjoy. But did you know that this perception of time can be influenced by our social interactions? In this study, researchers found that people who are more socially proficient tend to perceive time as shorter during social interactions. This effect was even stronger in people who had higher levels of oxytocin, a hormone that plays a role in social bonding. The researchers also found that people who are less socially proficient tend to perceive time as longer during social interactions. This effect was even weaker in people who had higher levels of oxytocin. These findings suggest that our perception of time during social interactions is influenced by our social proficiency and oxytocin levels. This could have important implications for understanding how we perceive and experience time in our daily lives.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, enters cells by binding to the ACE2 protein on the cell surface. Mutations in the virus's Spike protein, which binds to ACE2, have been identified that increase the virus's ability to bind to ACE2 and/or evade the immune system. In this study, the authors analyzed the effects of common mutations in the Spike protein and ACE2 on their interaction. They found that most of the mutations increased the affinity of the interaction, with the N501Y mutation increasing the affinity by about 10-fold. The authors suggest that these mutations may have been selected because they increase the virus's ability to bind to ACE2 and/or evade the immune system. This information could be useful in understanding the evolution of the virus and developing strategies to combat it.
 Genetic interactions occur when the presence of one genetic variant can mask, alleviate or amplify the phenotypic effect of other variants. These interactions are important in development and disease. In this study, the authors used RNA interference and single-cell phenotyping to generate a genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. They developed a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. The network they constructed helped to reconstruct the sequence of protein activities in mitosis and revealed an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signalling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodelling. Their study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations.
 Heterostyly is a common adaptation in plants that promotes outbreeding. It involves the development of two different morphs of flowers with different reproductive organs. The genetic basis of heterostyly is not well understood, but it is thought to be controlled by a supergene. In this study, the authors identified a gene called CYP734A50 that is responsible for the style-length dimorphism in Primula. They found that CYP734A50 is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype and is specifically expressed in S-morph styles. The authors also found that the loss or inactivation of CYP734A50 leads to long styles. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and shed light on the evolution of the S-locus supergene.
The study by Tanner et al. provides new insights into the neural circuits that control puberty and fertility. The authors used optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology, and single-cell RT-PCR to investigate the cellular basis for synchronized activity in kisspeptin-synthesizing neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1ARH). They found that high-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons evoked local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which synchronized the Kiss1ARH neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons by a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons. The authors propose that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role of driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.
 Bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) is a protein that helps cells decide what type of cell they will become. It is important for the development of many different types of cells, including bone cells, muscle cells, and nerve cells. However, it is not clear how BMP helps cells make these decisions. In this study, the authors found that BMP helps cells make decisions by controlling the activity of a protein called E-cadherin. E-cadherin helps cells stick together and is important for the development of many different types of cells. The authors found that BMP helps cells make decisions by controlling the activity of E-cadherin. They also found that BMP helps cells make decisions by controlling the activity of a protein called Id1. Id1 helps cells make decisions by controlling the activity of other proteins. The authors concluded that BMP helps cells make decisions by controlling the activity of E-cadherin and Id1. This study helps us understand how BMP helps cells make decisions about what type of cell they will become.
 The centrosome is a key organelle in animal cells that helps organize the microtubule network and plays a crucial role in cell division. The centrosome is composed of two centrioles, one older and one newer, surrounded by a matrix of proteins. The older centriole, called the mother centriole, is responsible for most of the centrosome's activity, while the newer centriole, called the daughter centriole, is less active. Recent studies have shown that the daughter centriole is actually more important than previously thought, and plays a key role in regulating the activity of the mother centriole. One protein that helps regulate the activity of the daughter centriole is called Cep120. In this study, the authors used a variety of techniques to investigate the role of Cep120 in the centrosome. They found that Cep120 is important for maintaining the correct balance of activity between the mother and daughter centrioles, and that it helps regulate the movement of proteins to and from the centrosome. The authors also found that mutations in Cep120 can lead to ciliopathies, a group of genetic disorders that affect the function of cilia. Overall, this study provides important insights into the role of the daughter centriole in the centrosome and the importance of Cep120 in regulating its activity.
 The retina is a part of the eye that contains neurons and glial cells. Glial cells are important for the development and maintenance of the retina. They are also involved in neuron-glia communication, which is important for the development of neural circuits. In the developing retina, neurons and glial cells exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses. This study shows that retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in Müller glial cells ( MCs ) . During cholinergic waves, MC calcium transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, whereas during glutamatergic waves, MC calcium transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Using an optical glutamate sensor, the study shows that the decline in MC calcium transients is caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. Together, these studies indicate that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.
Decomposition is the process by which dead organisms break down into simpler compounds. This process is influenced by many factors, including weather, soil type, and the presence of microorganisms. Microorganisms play a crucial role in decomposition, breaking down complex organic compounds into simpler ones that can be used by other organisms. However, the role of microorganisms in decomposition is not well understood. In this study, the authors used high-throughput DNA sequencing to characterize the microbial communities associated with decomposing mouse corpses. They found that the microbial communities changed significantly over time, with certain taxa becoming more or less abundant as the corpses decomposed. The authors also found that the microbial communities in the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils were distinct from those in the skin. These findings suggest that microbial communities could be used as a forensic tool to estimate the postmortem interval, or the time since death.
 The study by Krishnan et al. provides new insights into how the brain processes the pain of others. The authors compared the brain activity of people as they experienced pain and as they watched others in pain. They found that the brain regions activated when people experienced pain were different from those activated when they watched others in pain. This suggests that the brain processes the pain of others differently from the pain we feel ourselves. The study provides important new information about how the brain processes the pain of others, which could help us understand how people empathize with others in pain.
 AMPA receptors ( AMPARs ) are ion channels that help control the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. These channels are located on the surface of neurons, and they can move between different locations on the surface. In this study, the authors used different-sized fluorescent probes to track the movement of AMPARs in rat neurons. They found that most of the AMPARs were located inside small areas called postsynaptic densities ( PSDs ), and that they moved slowly within these areas. The authors also found that AMPARs labeled with large fluorescent probes were more likely to be located outside of PSDs, and that they moved more quickly. These findings suggest that the movement of AMPARs is regulated by the size of the fluorescent probes that are attached to them.
 The brain is very sensitive to changes in oxygen levels, and hypoxia can lead to brain damage. In this study, researchers found that hypoxia activates a process called SUMOylation in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). SUMOylation is a process where a small protein called SUMO is added to another protein, which can change the function of that protein. The researchers found that SUMOylation of a specific type of sodium channel called NaV1 . 2 increased the amount of current flowing through the channel. This increase in current was fast, occurring within 40 seconds of hypoxia. The researchers also found that the increase in current was caused by a change in the voltage required to activate the channel. They also found that the increase in current was blocked by a drug that blocks NaV1 . 2 channels. The researchers used several different techniques to study this process, including whole-cell voltage-clamp, fluorescent resonance energy transfer microscopy, and stochastic optical reconstruction super-resolution microscopy. They also used a technique called total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to study the process in real-time. Overall, this study provides new insights into how hypoxia affects the brain and could lead to new ways to prevent brain damage caused by hypoxia.
 Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes a severe flu-like illness in humans. The virus is transmitted by several mosquito species, and its transmission varies depending on the climate and habitat of the mosquitoes. To understand how temperature affects the transmission of RRV, a mathematical model was developed that takes into account the thermal responses of mosquito density and other life history traits. The model predicts that transmission peaks at moderate temperatures and declines to zero at thermal limits. The model also accurately predicts the seasonal peak in human cases in Australia. Climate warming is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas but decrease transmission in tropical areas. These results highlight the importance of considering nonlinear thermal responses in disease transmission models.
Beta oscillations are a type of brain wave that have been observed in the motor cortex during various motor tasks. However, the behavioral correlates of beta oscillations are not well understood. In this study, researchers used neurofeedback to manipulate beta oscillations in the motor cortex of three macaque monkeys while they performed a sequential neurofeedback-reaching task. The researchers found that the presence of beta oscillations influenced arm-reaching behavior, and that underlying neuronal population patterns shifted when beta oscillations were generated. These findings suggest that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts.
 TRAF2 is a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. It is involved in the regulation of TNF-induced NF-κB and MAPK signaling, and has been shown to be essential for the survival of immune cells. However, the role of TRAF2 in adult tissues is not well-explored. The authors of this study found that TRAF2 is essential for TNF-induced NF-κB and MAPK signaling in keratinocytes, but not in other cell types. They also found that TRAF2 is required to protect keratinocytes from cell death and to down-regulate inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TRAF2 may play a role in the development of psoriasis.
 Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are specialized organelles that store and secrete neurotransmitters at synapses. When SVs fuse with the plasma membrane, their membranes are rapidly taken up by endocytosis and recycled into new SVs. This process is called endocytic recycling. One type of endocytosis that occurs during intense neuronal activity is called bulk endocytosis. Bulk endosomes are large endocytic vacuoles that are formed by the fusion of many small endocytic vesicles. These bulk endosomes eventually disappear and are replaced by new SVs. In this study, the authors used electron microscopy to study the process of bulk endocytosis in neurons that lack dynamin 1 and 3, which are proteins that are important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. They found that bulk endocytosis still occurs in these neurons, but that it is less efficient than in normal neurons. They also found that the conversion of bulk endosomes into new SVs does not require clathrin-mediated budding. These findings suggest that there is a clathrin- and dynamin-independent pathway for the recycling of SV membranes during intense neuronal activity.
 Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly prescribed drugs, but there is no reliable way to measure their action. The aim of this study was to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of GC action. In a randomized, crossover, single-blind study, 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency were admitted to the clinic and studied during physiological and withdrawal of GCs. A multi-omic analysis strategy combining data from gene expression in circulation and an important metabolic tissue, adipose tissue, integrated with circulating microRNAs and metabolites was used to identify putative biomarkers. The strongest putative biomarkers were then replicated in independent study groups with different GC exposure. The study generated results that construct the basis for successful discovery of biomarkers to measure GC action, allowing strategies to individualize and optimize GC therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological GC exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.
 The protein kinase mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. It is activated by amino acids, which are sensed by a complex of RAG GTPases and RAGULATOR on the lysosomal membrane. The authors used live imaging to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids. They found that mTORC1 translocation to lysosomes is a transient event that occurs within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaks within 5 minutes. They also found that phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere. The authors used a cell permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester to image RAPTOR translocation in response to leucine. They found that leucine appearance in lysosomes is temporally coupled with RAPTOR translocation, and that RAPTOR translocation is sustained in comparison to amino acid stimulation. The authors also found that the vacuolar ATPase is a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity in their experimental system, and that sestrin2 is a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity. They also found that phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere.

The authors also found that the vacuolar ATPase is a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity in their experimental system, and that sestrin2 is a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity.
 The immune system is responsible for protecting the body from pathogens and cancer cells. One of the key components of the immune system is dendritic cells (DCs), which are specialized immune cells that capture and present antigens to T cells. Antigens are molecules that are recognized by the immune system as foreign and trigger an immune response. DCs capture antigens from pathogens or cancer cells and present them to T cells in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This process is called antigen presentation and it is essential for the activation of T cells. In this study, the authors investigated how the glycosylation of antigens affects their presentation by DCs. Glycosylation is the process of adding sugar molecules to proteins or lipids. The authors modified the glycosylation of an antigen called ovalbumin (OVA) by adding a specific type of sugar molecule called LewisX (LeX). They found that this modification caused OVA to be presented by DCs in a different way than unmodified OVA. Specifically, the modified OVA was presented in a way that was independent of two proteins called TAP1 and Cathepsin S, and it was also presented in a way that did not require signaling through toll-like receptors (TLRs). The authors also found that the modified OVA caused T cells to differentiate into a type of T cell called a Th1 cell, which is important for fighting intracellular pathogens and cancer cells. They also found that the modified OVA caused DCs to store the antigen in a special type of vesicle called a Rab11+LAMP1+ vesicle for a longer period of time than unmodified OVA. Overall, the authors' findings suggest that the glycosylation of antigens can have a big impact on how they are presented by DCs and how T cells respond to them. This could have important implications for the development of new vaccines and immunotherapies.
 Quorum sensing ( QS ) is a process that bacteria use to communicate with each other and coordinate their behavior. AHLs are molecules that are produced by some bacteria and used to signal to other bacteria. QS is important for many different functions in bacteria, including the production of public goods like extracellular enzymes. QS can also be used to control the production of private goods like enzymes that are used by the producing cell. In some cases, QS can be used to control the growth of cheating cells that do not produce public goods. In this study, the authors found that QS activates the production of toxins and their antitoxins in B . thailandensis. They also found that QS is important for controlling the growth of cheating cells that do not produce toxins. This study provides new insights into the role of QS in bacteria and how it can be used to control the behavior of other cells.
 The brain is made up of many different regions that work together to perform various functions. One of the most important regions is the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and learning. The hippocampus is connected to other parts of the brain through a network of nerve cells called neurons. These neurons communicate with each other by sending and receiving electrical signals called oscillations. These oscillations are important for the brain to function properly. However, it is not clear how these oscillations are generated and what role they play in the development of the brain. In this study, researchers used a special technique called optogenetics to selectively activate certain neurons in the hippocampus of mice. They found that activating certain neurons in the intermediate and ventral part of the hippocampus caused the brain to generate oscillations that were important for the development of the brain. This study provides important new information about how the brain develops and how different parts of the brain work together.
 The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a long, disordered region that is important for the regulation of gene expression. The CTD is composed of repeating units of the sequence YSPTSPS, and it is modified by a variety of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation. In addition to these modifications, the CTD can also be methylated at the lysine residues at position 7 (K7). The authors of this study have identified two new modifications of the CTD: mono- and di-methylation of K7. They have also shown that these modifications occur at the earliest stages of transcription and are present at promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA. The authors have also shown that the balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation is important for the regulation of gene expression.
 Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are a type of stem cell that reside in the muscle tissue and can be activated to repair muscle damage. When activated, these cells go through a process of differentiation to become new muscle cells. To understand the mechanisms involved in this process, researchers have identified genes that are differentially expressed during SC activation. One of these genes is Tristetraprolin (TTP), which encodes a protein that promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment. The researchers found that p38α/β MAPK, a signaling pathway that is activated during SC activation, phosphorylates TTP and stabilizes MyoD mRNA. This stabilization of MyoD mRNA is important for the activation of SCs and their differentiation into new muscle cells. The researchers also found that TTP is one of the fastest declining and dynamically regulated mRNAs following SC activation. This suggests that post-transcriptional gene regulation plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of SCs in adult skeletal muscle.
 The human body is protected from harmful bacteria and viruses by the immune system. This system is made up of many different types of cells that work together to fight off infections. One type of cell that is important for the immune system is called a macrophage. Macrophages are found in many different parts of the body, including the lungs, liver, and intestines. They are responsible for engulfing and destroying foreign particles that enter the body.  In this study, researchers looked at how the immune system works in mice that are missing a protein called IL10R. This protein is important for the immune system to work properly. The researchers found that mice that are missing IL10R develop colitis, which is a type of inflammation in the intestines. They also found that this colitis develops later in life, when the mice are around 3 weeks old.  The researchers then looked at how the immune system works in mice that are missing IL10R specifically in the cells called macrophages. They found that these mice also developed colitis, but it started to develop earlier in life, when the mice were around 2 weeks old. This suggests that IL10R is important for macrophages to work properly and protect the body from infections.  The researchers also looked at how the immune system works in mice that are missing IL10R and have a genetic mutation that makes them more likely to develop colitis. They found that these mice developed colitis even earlier in life, when the mice were around 1 week old. This suggests that IL10R is even more important for preventing colitis in mice that are more likely to develop it.  Overall, this study shows that IL10R is important for the immune system to work properly and protect the body from infections. It also shows that IL10R is especially important for preventing colitis in mice that are more likely to develop it.
 In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , the piRNA pathway regulates the expression of germline genes and transposons . The pathway involves the production of small RNAs that target specific mRNAs for degradation. The authors of this study have identified a new protein, SIMR-1, that is required for the production of these small RNAs. They found that SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules, where piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition occurs, and Mutator foci, where siRNA amplification occurs. These findings suggest that SIMR-1 plays a role in coordinating the activities of these two distinct subcellular foci.
 Purkinje neurons are a type of neuron found in the cerebellum of animals. They are known for their high levels of spontaneous activity, which has been observed in vitro and in vivo under anesthesia. However, the existence of bistability in Purkinje neurons in vivo in awake animals has been disputed. In this study, the authors used intracellular recordings to study the firing patterns of Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebrafish. They found that Purkinje neurons exhibited bistability, with tonic firing at depolarized membrane potentials and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. The authors also found that activation of AMPARs by climbing fibers was sufficient to trigger bursts. Furthermore, they showed that initiation of motor neuron spiking was correlated with increased incidence of climbing fiber EPSPs and membrane depolarization. The authors also demonstrated that bistability was observed soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persisted at least until late larval stages. These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of bistability in Purkinje neurons in vivo in awake animals.
 The skin is a complex organ that plays a crucial role in protecting the body from external stimuli. The skin is composed of several layers of cells, including hair follicles, which are specialized structures that produce hair. Hair follicles are innervated by sensory neurons that detect mechanical stimuli, such as touch and pressure, and transmit this information to the central nervous system. The sensory neurons are associated with hair follicles through a complex network of nerve fibers and Schwann cells, which are specialized cells that wrap around nerve fibers and provide support and insulation. In this study, the authors used a combination of genetic, histological, and electron microscopy techniques to investigate the structure and function of the nerve fiber-Schwann cell network associated with hair follicles. They found that the nerve fiber-Schwann cell network is highly organized and that Schwann cells are essential for maintaining the structure and function of the nerve fiber network. The authors also used a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of the nerve fiber-Schwann cell network and found that it is able to adapt to changes in mechanical stimuli. Overall, this study provides important insights into the structure and function of the nerve fiber-Schwann cell network associated with hair follicles and sheds light on the mechanisms by which sensory neurons detect and transmit mechanical stimuli.
 Macropinocytosis is a process by which cells take up large amounts of extracellular fluid into large vesicles called macropinosomes. This process is important for many cellular functions, including nutrient uptake and immune defense. However, the mechanisms by which cells organize actin to form the walls of the macropinosome cups are not well understood. In this study, the authors used lattice light sheet microscopy to examine the formation of macropinosome cups in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. They found that the cups are organized around patches of active Ras and Rac, which are in turn surrounded by a ring of active SCAR/WAVE. The authors propose that the formation of macropinosome cups is driven by self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of macropinosome cup formation and may help us understand how this process is disrupted in diseases such as cancer.
 The cohesin ring holds newly replicated sister chromatids together until their separation at anaphase . The Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 ( Scc2/4 ) complex loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome . Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division , and partial defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation , leading to severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms . In this study , the authors present a crystal structure showing the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4 . They also demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion . These findings reveal the role of Scc4 in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establish a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres .
 Hibernation is a common survival strategy for many animals that live in cold environments. During hibernation, animals slow down their metabolism and body temperature to conserve energy. However, hibernation can also have negative effects on an animal's body, such as reduced growth and reproductive success. In this study, researchers investigated how the time of birth and food availability affect the growth, fattening, and hibernation patterns of juvenile garden dormice. They found that juveniles born later in the season grew and gained mass at a faster rate, but had lower fat content prior to hibernation. These juveniles also used torpor more frequently and had lower reproductive success the following year. These findings suggest that the time of birth and food availability can have significant effects on an animal's ability to survive and reproduce.
Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are RNA-binding proteins that can change the chemical structure of RNA molecules by converting adenosine (A) to inosine (I). This process, called RNA editing, can affect the way that RNA molecules are translated into proteins. In this study, the authors used a new method to isolate and study the RNA editing events that occur in the neural cells of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that loss of ADARs in these cells can affect the expression of a specific gene called clec-41, which is important for proper chemotaxis (the movement of cells towards a chemical signal). The authors then used a new software tool to identify the specific RNA editing events that occur in clec-41. They found that loss of ADARs can affect the expression of clec-41 by changing the way that the gene is translated into a protein. The authors then used a new method to express a mutant form of ADAR in the neural cells of worms that lack ADARs. They found that this mutant form of ADAR was not enough to rescue the chemotaxis defects caused by the loss of ADARs. This suggests that the editing activity of ADARs is important for proper chemotaxis. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of RNA editing in the nervous system and how it can affect gene expression and cellular function.
 Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To ensure efficient translation of its own mRNAs, IAV employs a strategy known as host shutoff, which involves the degradation of host mRNAs and the co-opting of the host translation machinery. In this study, the authors used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms of host shutoff in IAV-infected cells. They found that IAV does not preferentially translate its own mRNAs and that the reduction in host protein synthesis is mainly achieved by the degradation of host mRNAs. The authors also noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins are less affected by IAV infection, and their continuous expression supports the energetic demands that are essential for virus replication. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of host shutoff in IAV-infected cells and may help in the development of new therapeutic strategies against IAV infections.
 The study by Gisby et al. 2021 is a detailed analysis of the distribution of two signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, in the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila. The authors used genetically encoded fluorescent tags to track the movement of these proteins in real-time and found that they are transported through cytonemes, which are actin-based filopodia that extend from the source of the signal to the recipient cells. The authors also found that the number of FGF-receiving cytonemes decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, resulting in a recipient-specific FGF gradient. This gradient is important for the proper development of the wing imaginal disc, as it regulates the expression of genes involved in tissue growth and patterning. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of gradient formation and highlights the role of cytonemes in tissue morphogenesis.
α-Helical coiled coils are a common protein fold found in a wide range of organisms and functions. They are made up of two or more parallel α-helices wound together into a supercoiled bundle. The backbone structure of coiled coils is well understood and can be described by parametric equations. However, recent studies have shown that the insertion of just a few residues into the underlying heptad repeat can cause the supercoil to break and form a new type of fiber. These fibers are made up of alternating α-helical and β-strand regions. The new fiber is called an α/β coiled coil and retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. The results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold. This discovery could have important implications for protein design and engineering.
Epsin is a protein that helps with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells take in materials from their environment. To understand the function of epsin, researchers generated embryonic fibroblasts from mice that lacked all three epsin proteins. These cells had a severe division defect and a strong impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This defect was caused by a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which was confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. The researchers also found that epsin has a low affinity interaction with synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2, a protein that helps with the formation of vesicles. These findings provide new insights into the function of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
 Asthma is a common chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, including children in Africa. However, there is limited information on the causes of asthma in Africa. In this study, the authors conducted a case-control study among schoolchildren in urban Uganda to investigate the risk factors for asthma. They found that children born in urban areas had an increased risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas. Additionally, children with a higher parental socio-economic status and those who cooked on gas or electricity had an increased risk of asthma. The authors also found that children with a history of allergic conditions and atopy had an increased risk of asthma. These findings provide important information on the risk factors for asthma in urban Uganda and may help guide future research and interventions to prevent and manage asthma in this population.
 The zebrafish has a unique pattern of stripes on its body and fins that are made up of three different types of pigment cells. These pigment cells are called melanophores, iridophores, and xanthophores. The pattern is formed during metamorphosis, a period of development that occurs between 3 and 6 weeks of age. The pattern is created by interactions between all three types of pigment cells. Mutations in a gene called leo, which encodes a subunit of gap junctions, cause a loss of the pattern. In this study, the authors identified a new dominant allele of leo called leotK3, which leads to a complete loss of the pattern. They also identified a new gene called luchs, which encodes another subunit of gap junctions. The authors found that both leo and luchs are required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores. They suggest that gap junctions formed by Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 are required for the pattern to form.
 The sense of smell is incredibly important for many animals, including humans. Different animals have different ways of detecting odors, and scientists are trying to understand how these systems evolved over time. Insects have a unique way of detecting odors, using a group of proteins called olfactory receptors. Scientists have studied these receptors in many different insects, but they have not been able to find them in some of the earliest insects. In this study, scientists used a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques to study the olfactory receptors in three different ancient insects. They found that the earliest insects did not have olfactory receptors like the ones found in other insects. Instead, they found a different type of protein that may have been involved in detecting odors. This study provides important information about how the sense of smell evolved in insects.
 Malaria is a major global health problem, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has set a goal of eliminating the disease by 2030. One approach to achieving this goal is through mass drug administration (MDA), which involves providing antimalarial drugs to entire populations. However, the effectiveness of MDA depends on high levels of participation and adherence to treatment. In this study, researchers analyzed data from four villages in Myanmar that underwent MDA as part of a clinical trial. They found that individuals living in neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had a much higher risk of having a malaria episode after MDA, regardless of their own participation in MDA. They also found that high mosquito biting rates, living in a house with someone else who had malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were predictors of clinical episodes. These findings suggest that spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA may frustrate elimination efforts, and that community engagement and education may be important for the success of MDA programs.
 The study by Poon et al.  compares the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila transcription factors (TFs) to those of human and mouse TFs. They found that the binding specificities of TFs are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that even subtle dinucleotide preferences are conserved. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.
 The heart and lungs are two of the most important organs in the human body. They work together to help us breathe and to pump blood throughout our body. However, there is still a lot that scientists do not know about how these two organs develop and work together. In this study, researchers used human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to create a new model for studying how the heart and lungs develop and work together. They were able to create a 3D suspension culture of hiPSCs that formed concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-tissues (μTs). They then used this model to study how the heart and lungs work together to help the body breathe. They found that the heart and lungs work together to help the body breathe, and that this interaction is important for the development of both organs. This new model could help scientists better understand how the heart and lungs work together and how they develop during embryogenesis.
 The study by Trovisco et al. shows that the mutation rate of bacteria can change in response to changes in the environment. The study used Escherichia coli bacteria and found that when the bacteria were exposed to high levels of ethanol, their mutation rate increased. This increase in mutation rate was temporary and the bacteria eventually adapted to the high levels of ethanol. The study also found that cellular mortality was the main force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates. This study provides new insights into how bacteria adapt to changing environments and highlights the importance of mutation rate in this process.
 The AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are important regulators of metabolism in animals, yeast, and plants. They are activated under energy-stress conditions and regulate the activity of key metabolic enzymes and transcription factors. In plants, the bZIP63 transcription factor is a key regulator of metabolism under energy-stress conditions. It is phosphorylated by the SnRK1 kinase, which changes its dimerization preference and affects its target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A bzip63 knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 is crucial for its function in plants.
 Neurons communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. Chemical signals are sent through the release of molecules called neurotransmitters, which bind to receptors on the surface of other neurons. One type of neurotransmitter is called glutamate, which is released by excitatory neurons and binds to glutamate receptors on the surface of other neurons. Glutamate receptors are made up of different subunits, and one type of subunit is called GluN2A. GluN2A is important for learning and memory, and it is also involved in many neurological disorders. In this study, researchers found a new protein that is important for communication between neurons. This protein is called RNF10, and it is found at the synapse, which is the junction between two neurons where communication takes place. RNF10 is specifically associated with the GluN2A subunit of glutamate receptors. When glutamate receptors are activated, RNF10 is released from the synapse and travels to the nucleus of the neuron. In the nucleus, RNF10 binds to a protein called importin α1, which helps it travel to the right location in the cell. Once RNF10 arrives at its destination, it binds to a protein called Meox2, which helps it regulate gene expression. Gene expression is the process by which cells make proteins, and it is important for the function of the cell. The researchers found that when RNF10 is not present, the neurons do not learn as well. This shows that RNF10 is important for learning and memory. The researchers also found that when RNF10 is not present, the neurons do not make the right proteins. This shows that RNF10 is important for the function of the cell. Overall, this study shows that RNF10 is an important protein that helps neurons communicate with each other and helps them function properly.
 Swi2/Snf2 ATPases are a large and diverse class of proteins that remodel DNA-associated complexes to control a wide range of DNA-associated processes. The single subunit remodeler Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP) :DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, the authors report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). Their data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. The study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.
 In this study, researchers designed new synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown. The new ternatin variants are more potent than the original ternatin and have been shown to inhibit cellular protein synthesis. The researchers also identified the elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides. This family of N-methylated cyclic heptapeptides represents a new structural class of macrocyclic elongation factor-1A inhibitors.
5-phosphatases are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from phosphoinositides, which are important signaling molecules in cells. Mutations in one of these enzymes, OCRL, cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. These diseases are characterized by a variety of symptoms, including cataracts, cognitive disabilities, and developmental delay. OCRL is found in many parts of the cell, including the plasma membrane, endosomes, and Golgi apparatus. It is thought to play a role in preventing the build-up of ectopic intracellular pools of phosphoinositides. However, the specific function of OCRL in these diseases is not well understood. In this study, the authors used a variety of techniques to investigate the function of OCRL in Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. They found that OCRL is important for the normal progression of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells take in materials from their environment. They also found that OCRL is important for the recycling of endocytic factors, which are necessary for the normal progression of endocytosis. These findings suggest that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.
 The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and differentiation, and its dysregulation is associated with many cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In CRC, the tumor suppressor gene APC is often mutated, leading to increased levels of β-catenin and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, not all CRCs with APC mutations show strong activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that other factors may regulate this pathway in CRC. In this study, the authors identified a new regulatory axis for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC: the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin axis. They found that FAK and PYK2, which are elevated in adenomas in APCmin/+ mice and in human CRC tissues, functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3βY216 to reinforce pathway output - β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice accompanied with reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin, indicating that FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC driven intestinal tumorigenesis. These findings suggest that targeting FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis may be a new therapeutic strategy for CRC.
 The brain controls our movements by adjusting the feedback it receives from our senses. This feedback helps the brain to make sure that we stay balanced and move smoothly. However, when we transition from one movement to another, such as from standing still to walking, the brain needs to adjust its feedback in order to make the transition. In this study, researchers used electrical stimulation to the inner ear to measure how the brain adjusts its feedback during these transitions. They found that the brain disengages its feedback from the inner ear before making the transition, and then re-engages it after the transition has been made. This suggests that the brain uses a discrete change in feedback to make these transitions. This finding is important because it helps us understand how the brain controls our movements, and how it adapts to different situations.
 The circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus controls the timing of gene expression and metabolism in response to changes in light and dark periods. Deletion of the transcription factor RpaA, which is controlled by the circadian clock, causes cells to be unable to switch between day and night metabolic states when exposed to alternating light and dark periods. This leads to defects in carbon accumulation and utilization, which can be corrected by providing an external carbon source. This study highlights the importance of circadian regulation of metabolism in adapting to changing environmental conditions.
 Transition metals are essential micronutrients for all organisms, but also highly toxic in excessive amounts. P-type ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, conferring cellular detoxification and redistribution through transport of these ions across cellular membranes. No structural information is available for the PIB-4-ATPases, the subclass with the broadest cargo scope, and hence even their topology remains elusive. Here, we present structures and complementary functional analyses of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1. The data disclose the architecture, devoid of classical so-called heavy-metal-binding domains (HMBDs), and provide fundamentally new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. We reveal several novel P-type ATPase features, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. We also establish that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium independent, contrasting to many other P-type ATPases. Combined with new inhibitory compounds, our results open up for efforts in for example drug discovery, since PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.
 In mammals , many genes are expressed from only one of the two copies in each cell , a phenomenon known as monoallelic expression ( MAE ). This can happen in a variety of ways, including through the inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in females or the imprinting of certain genes. However, the majority of MAE cases are not well understood, and there is no clear molecular feature that has been linked to MAE. In this study, the authors developed a new approach to identify MAE genes based on a specific chromatin signature. They found that this signature is present in about 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. The authors also found that the signature is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. This new approach provides a new way to study MAE that is independent of polymorphisms and suggests that MAE is linked to cell differentiation.
 The human body is made up of many different types of cells, each with its own unique functions. Some cells, such as muscle cells, are specialized to move the body. Other cells, such as nerve cells, are specialized to send messages throughout the body. In order for these cells to do their jobs properly, they need to be able to communicate with each other. One way that cells communicate is through the use of proteins called receptors. These proteins are found on the surface of cells and can bind to specific molecules that are released by other cells. When a receptor binds to one of these molecules, it can trigger a response inside the cell. This response can be anything from changing the shape of the cell to releasing a chemical that will help the cell do its job. Scientists have been studying receptors for many years, and they have found that they play a very important role in how cells communicate with each other. In this study, scientists used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to look at the structure of a protein called ClpC. They found that ClpC is made up of two large rings that are connected together. When another protein called MecA is added to ClpC, the two rings separate and the protein becomes active. This study provides important information about how ClpC works and how it is regulated by MecA. This information could help scientists understand how to control ClpC in order to treat certain diseases.
 Stem cells are specialized cells that can renew themselves and give rise to different types of cells. They are important for development and for maintaining tissues throughout life. Stem cells are often found in a specific location in the body, called a niche, where they receive signals that help them maintain their undifferentiated state and regulate their behavior. In this study, the authors used a fruit fly model to study the behavior of adult muscle stem cells, called adult muscle precursors (AMPs). They found that AMPs send out long cellular processes that make contact with neighboring muscles. The authors also found that muscles send out signals that switch the insulin pathway ON in AMPs and initiate their reactivation. This leads to the activation of Notch, which positively regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. The authors conclude that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs.
 The brain is made up of many different types of neurons, each with its own unique properties. Some neurons are capable of firing spontaneously, even in the absence of any external stimuli. These neurons are important for many different functions in the brain, including the regulation of movement and attention. In this study, researchers used a new technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the properties of a type of neuron called GABAergic neurons. These neurons are found in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and they are important for controlling movement. The researchers found that these neurons express a protein called NALCN, which helps them fire spontaneously. They also found that these neurons are sensitive to changes in the levels of a molecule called glycolysis, which is important for providing energy to the brain. These findings could help us understand how the brain works and how to treat diseases that affect movement and attention.
 The discovery of new antibiotics is crucial for the treatment of bacterial infections, but the process of finding new compounds is time-consuming and expensive.  Microbiologists have developed new techniques to cultivate bacteria that are difficult to grow in the lab, such as using microfluidic devices and droplets.  In this study, researchers used a droplet-based microscale cultivation system to grow bacteria that were previously unculturable.  They found that the system was able to grow a diverse range of bacteria, including those that produce antimicrobial compounds.  The researchers then used a high-throughput screening method to identify bacteria that produce antimicrobial compounds.  They found that the droplet-based system was able to identify new antibiotics that were not found using traditional methods.  Overall, this study shows that the droplet-based microscale cultivation system is a powerful tool for discovering new antibiotics.
 Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that affects the lungs and can be fatal if left untreated. In some cases, the infection can spread to the brain, causing a condition called tuberculous meningitis (TBM). TBM is a serious condition that can cause swelling of the brain and can be fatal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 The brain is a complex network of cells that communicate with each other to perform various functions. One of the most important ways that cells communicate is through the use of proteins called receptors. These receptors are found on the surface of cells and bind to molecules called ligands that are found in the surrounding environment. When a receptor binds to a ligand, it can trigger a signaling cascade within the cell that leads to a specific response. In this study, researchers used a mouse model to investigate the role of a specific receptor called Shootin1 in the guidance of axons, which are the long projections that connect neurons in the brain. They found that Shootin1 is important for the guidance of axons in response to a chemical signal called netrin-1. They also found that Shootin1 interacts with a protein called L1-CAM, which helps to anchor the axon to the surrounding environment. This interaction is important for the generation of forces that help the axon to move in the correct direction. Overall, this study provides important insights into how axons are guided in the brain and how this guidance is regulated by specific receptors and ligands.
 Hummingbirds are small, colorful birds that are known for their ability to hover in mid-air. They do this by rapidly flapping their wings, which creates a unique sound called a hum. Scientists have been trying to understand how hummingbirds create this sound, but it has been difficult to study because the sound is very quiet and the birds are moving quickly. In this study, researchers used a special microphone array to record the sound of hummingbirds while they were hovering. They also used a special platform to measure the forces that the birds' wings were creating while they were flying. By combining these two pieces of information, the researchers were able to create a model that explains how the hummingbirds create their unique sound. They then used this model to study how the sound changes in different types of birds and insects. The researchers found that the sound is created by the forces that the wings are creating, and that these forces change depending on the size and speed of the bird or insect. This information could help scientists understand how different animals use sound to communicate with each other.
 Evolution is a complex process that involves many factors, including chance, contingency, and necessity. However, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of these factors because they have never been assessed in a single system or on timescales relevant to historical evolution. In this study, the authors used ancestral protein reconstruction and a new continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family to acquire protein–protein interaction specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins, the authors found that contingency generated over long historical timescales steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation. The authors suggest that patterns of variation in BCL-2 sequences are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events.
48 sub-Saharan African groups were analyzed to understand the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in the continent. The study revealed that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. In fact, most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. The study provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology.
 The study investigates how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions during Xenopus laevis embryogenesis. The authors developed an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts prepared from embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37 µm) and stage 8 (∼4000 cells, 18 µm). They identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α, and activated in stage 8 when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization. The study suggests that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities.
 In this study, researchers discovered a new type of riboswitch aptamer that can bind two different ligands, guanine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), to regulate gene expression. Riboswitches are RNA molecules that sense specific metabolites and regulate gene expression in response. The new riboswitch aptamer, called ykkC subtype 2b, was found to be highly similar to another type of riboswitch, called ykkC subtype 2a, which binds the alarmone ppGpp. However, ykkC subtype 2b can also bind PRPP, which is a precursor to purines. The researchers found that ykkC subtype 2b RNAs are commonly associated with genes involved in purine biosynthesis, and that they can function as two-input molecular logic gates to regulate gene expression. This discovery provides new insights into the complexity of RNA-based regulatory systems and their ability to sense multiple ligands to regulate gene expression.
 The number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential is a fundamental property of synaptic transmission that determines the reliability of synaptic signaling. However, the source of this variability is unclear. The prevailing view is that release of a single or multiple vesicles reflects variability in vesicle release probability, a notion that is well-supported by the calcium-dependence of release mode. However, using mouse brain slices, we now demonstrate that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool, upstream of vesicle release probability. Our results point to a model wherein protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. Together these findings define molecular mechanisms that control multivesicular release and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.
 HIV-1 Gag selectively packages its RNA genome into viral particles. The process of RNA selection is dependent on the ability of Gag to self-assemble on membranes. In this study, the authors used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag, and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5’ untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. They found that the ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are interdependent on one another. The authors also found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 RNA packaging and the role of membranes in this process.
