 The Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) TAR2-LIKE (BdTAR2L) gene plays a crucial role in root development by regulating auxin biosynthesis through tryptophan aminotransferase activity. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), auxin biosynthesis via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) requires redundant TAA1 and TAR genes, and their loss leads to impaired root growth. However, in Brachypodium, a loss-of-function mutation in the BdTAR2L gene results in dramatically elongated seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation and increased auxin levels. This contrasts with the gradual reduction in root growth and auxin levels observed in Arabidopsis taa1/tar mutants.The Bdtar2lhypo mutant, which contains a T-DNA insertion in the BdTAR2L gene, displays increased cell elongation and cellular anisotropy in the root, as evidenced by longer and thinner mature root cells and shorter root hairs. Another mutant allele, Bdtar2lqnull, which has a T-DNA insertion in the second intron of the BdTAR2L gene, also displays increased cell elongation and cellular anisotropy, but the root growth is not sustained, and the mutants display more severe shoot phenotypes.Interestingly, Brachypodium roots respond differently to TAA1/TAR inhibitors than Arabidopsis roots. While Arabidopsis wild type plants and taa1 mutants are hypersensitive to L-kynerunine, a specific TAA1/TAR inhibitor, Brachypodium roots display elevated auxin levels upon L-kynerunine treatment. This is due to increased expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for conversion of IPA to auxin.The ethylene pathway appears to repress auxin biosynthesis via the IPA pathway in Brachypodium by down-regulating BdYUCCA expression. This is in contrast to Arabidopsis, where ethylene promotes auxin biosynthesis through transcriptional regulation of TAA1/TAR and YUCCA genes.In summary, the Brachypodium TAR2-LIKE gene plays a critical role in root development by regulating auxin biosynthesis through tryptophan aminotransferase activity. The loss of function in this gene results in increased cell elongation and cellular anisotropy, which is accompanied by elevated auxin levels. The regulation of auxin biosynthesis through the ethylene pathway in Brachypodium appears to differ from that in Arabidopsis, with ethylene repressing rather than promoting auxin biosynthesis via the IPA pathway.
 The organization of chromosomes inside the cell nucleus plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Chromosomes are long, densely packed polymers that exhibit distinct universal properties due to their confinement within the nucleus. Understanding the mechanisms behind chromosome folding is essential to decipher the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression. Chromosomes are organized hierarchically, with each chromosome occupying its own territory and genes sharing the same transcriptional state tending to colocalize. Chromosomes are modeled as self-avoiding polymers, and the entanglement length, which measures the typical subchain size above which topological confinement influences configurational fluctuations, is a critical parameter.To investigate the folding and dynamics of chromosomes, researchers use coarse-grained models that simplify the underlying fine-scale model while preserving its essential features. However, neglecting topological constraints in these models may lead to incorrect interpretations of the results. In this study, the authors propose a coarse-graining strategy for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice that conserves the entanglement regime and the volumic density, allowing for efficient simulations while maintaining the accuracy of the underlying fine-scale model. They apply this strategy to investigate the role of epigenomic-driven interactions in the folding and dynamics of a large fraction of chromosome 3R in drosophila. Their findings suggest that chromatin is very dynamic during the cell cycle and that epigenomics is a primary driver of chromosome folding in drosophila. The model predictions are in excellent agreement with Hi-C data, and the strength of interaction compatible with the data is weak. The authors also detect several discrepancies between the predicted and experimental contact maps, which could be due to a wrong annotation of the local epigenetic content or the existence of specific interactions driven by other biological processes not accounted for in the model. Future work includes investigating the role of other types of interactions, like those associated with the nuclear membrane, and the crosstalk with epigenomic-driven interactions.
 Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite, replicates in mammalian cells within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with any host organelles. To acquire nutrients, Toxoplasma exploits host organelles, including lipid droplets (LD). In this study, the authors investigated the interaction between Toxoplasma and host LD, focusing on the exploitation of host LD for nutrient acquisition.The authors found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes (ADRP, DGAT2) progressively increase until the onset of parasite replication. Throughout infection, PV are surrounded by host LD. Toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host LD and incorporating these lipids into its own membranes and LD. Exogenous addition of oleic acid stimulates LD biogenesis in the host cell and results in the overaccumulation of neutral lipids in very large LD inside the parasite.To access LD-derived lipids, Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes within the PV host LD, some of which remain associated with Rab7, which become wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host LD. Moreover, parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV, suggesting a major contribution of the IVN for host LD processing in the PV and, thus, lipid content release.Interestingly, gavage of parasites with lipids reveals, for the first time, the presence in Toxoplasma of endocytic-like structures containing lipidic material originating from the PV lumen. This study highlights the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and the parasite’s capability in scavenging neutral lipids from host LD.
 The BMP signaling pathway plays a crucial role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development, and the Drosophila embryo serves as a model to decipher the BMP-responsive transcriptional network underlying differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm. In this study, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data were combined to identify Dpp signaling responsive genes and enhancers. The results revealed that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription, establishing a balance between BMP and EGF signaling. Key roles for Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in Dpp gradient interpretation were also identified, along with widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. The findings were integrated into a model for Mad-dependent activation and discussed in the context of BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.Using RNA-seq, Dpp signaling responsive genes were identified by comparing TkvQD expressing embryos to control embryos. The analysis revealed that 331 genes, including 12 out of 14 previously identified Dpp target genes, showed altered expression patterns. Validation of a subset of positively regulated Dpp target genes revealed various expression patterns in the dorsal ectoderm, with some genes showing amnioserosa-specific expression in later stage embryos.ChIP-seq data for pMad and Brinker revealed that both factors occupy similar locations at 3-3.5 hours after egg laying (AEL) as 2-2.5 hours AEL, with additional binding to other enhancers at the later time point. Approximately 70% of the 65 Dpp target genes confirmed to be upregulated in the early embryo had a ChIP peak within 40kb. Integration of the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data sets revealed that ~30% of ChIP peaks had a differentially expressed gene within 40kb, with genes potentially regulated by multiple enhancers.The EGF pathway was found to be regulated by Dpp signaling, with rho and vein being activated by Dpp signaling, enabling dorsal MAPK pathway activation. The activated dpERK promotes pMad degradation in the early embryo, establishing a nuclear pMad level that activates Dpp target genes, including egr, with Egr then functioning via positive feedback to promote refinement of the pMad stripe at the dorsal midline. Embryos mutant for kek1, encoding an inhibitor of the EGF receptor, have a narrower domain of dpERK activation, which alters the pMad-dpERK equilibrium, leading to reduced pMad levels and disrupted Dpp target gene expression. Conversely, egfr or rho mutant embryos have a loss/reduction in dpERK, leading to expanded Race expression.Insulator proteins, including BEAF-32, ZIPIC, Chromator, and PITA, were found to bind to many of the pMad/Brk ChIP enhancers, including those for Race, ana, egr, ush, Ama, and pnr. This binding may promote enhancer-promoter loops and gene activation through the release of paused Pol II. The findings suggest that insulator proteins facilitate Mad-dependent activation of some target genes.
 In this study, the systemic alterations of mitochondrial protein expressions were investigated under dysfunctional mt states using a data-integrative network analysis. Through network clustering analysis, it was discovered that cells respond to pathological conditions by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. Up-regulated and down-regulated proteins of dysfunctional mt states were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. Functional modules controlling mt protein translation, folding, proteolysis, and mtDNA repair were up-regulated in the dysfunctional ρ0 state. These processes may require retrograde regulation to properly respond to changes in cellular states. Up-regulated functional modules act as cross-talk components connecting mitochondria with other organelles to sense and propagate the retrograde signal upon mtDNA depletion stress to facilitate mitochondrial survival. The proteins of up-regulated functional modules tended to have multiple annotations of subcellular localization and to be involved in processes occurring inside and outside of mitochondria. For example, AP-endonuclease 1 (APEX1) of the DNA repair module is known to shuttle from mitochondria to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress, and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRPK) of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with mtDNA transcription has been detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. These observations suggest that up-regulated functional modules act as cross-talk components connecting mitochondria with other organelles to sense and propagate the retrograde signal upon mtDNA depletion stress to facilitate mitochondrial survival. The expression of up- and down-regulated proteins was controlled in several different levels. From the comparisons between protein and mRNA abundance under the dysfunctional ρ0 state, it was found that most up- and down-regulated mt proteins had increased mRNA expression levels, indicating that up-regulated proteins were successfully recruited into ρ0 mitochondria. It has been proposed that there is a compensatory mt protein import pathway independent from the dissipated membrane potential, which facilitates the translocations of proteins involved in mt protein folding and mtDNA repair to the mitochondria. This pathway implies that "emergency" proteins are increasingly imported to dysfunctional ρ0 mitochondria to repair pathophysiological mt conditions. The cross-talk properties of up-regulated functional modules support this idea. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and the role of retrograde signaling in mitochondrial survival.
 The dissociation mechanism of the thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complexes with arsenate reductase (ArsC) has been a subject of debate for over twenty years. The activation of the nucleophilic cysteine as a thiolate during the dissociation of the complex is unknown. Using the complex between Trx and its endogenous substrate, ArsC, as a model, researchers observed that conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx. Cys32Trx is activated for its nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds and is found to be more reactive than Cys82ArsC. Additionally, Cys32Trx directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx and not on Cys89ArsC. This multidisciplinary approach provides new insights into the universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism that results in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx.The thioredoxin (Trx) is a powerful and universal protein disulfide bond oxido-reductase with a very low redox potential. It has a similar three-dimensional fold comprising a central core of four β-strands surrounded by three α-helices, and all feature a conserved active-site loop containing two redox-active cysteine residues. The active site is at the end of an alpha helix, extending from Lys33 to Glu45, and the pKa of the N-terminal active-site cysteine is significantly lower than the pKa of a cysteine in the absence of a structured protein environment, enabling it to act as a nucleophile. Well-documented endogenous substrates of Trx include the arsenate reductases (ArsC) from the thioredoxin-coupled ArsC family.ArsC catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite and is a key enzyme involved in arsenic detoxification. It combines a phosphatase-like nucleophilic displacement reaction in the active site with a distinct intra-molecular disulfide-bond cascade. Three redox active cysteines are involved: Cys10, Cys82, and Cys89. After a single catalytic arsenate reduction event, oxidized ArsC exposes a disulfide between Cys82 and Cys89 on a looped-out redox helix. Thioredoxin converts oxidized ArsC back to its initial reduced state by nucleophilically attacking Cys89ArsC of the Cys82ArsC-Cys89ArsC disulfide, leading to the formation of the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide intermediate complex between Cys29Trx and Cys89ArsC. In this complex, Cys32Trx performs a nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx of the Cys29Trx-Cys89ArsC disulfide.The mechanism behind the experimentally observed regioselectivity (attack on Cys89ArsC instead of on Cys82ArsC during complex formation and on Cys29Trx instead of on Cys89ArsC during complex dissociation) is not known. Experimentally, it has been observed that Cys32Trx had performed a nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx, but why and how this can occur was not known. A priori, there is another possibility: a nucleophilic attack by Cys82Trx leading to an unproductive cycle. The regioselectivity analysis gives explanatory insights into the observed mechanism, which could not be understood on the basis of prior information including the experimental structure of the Trx-ArsC complex. This regioselectivity is critical for the function of the involved proteins and is a recurring question within thiol-oxidoreductases.To study Trx mixed disulfide complex formation and dissociation, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, pKa calculations, reactivity analysis with conceptual density functional theory (DFT), and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants were applied. These various elements were combined to propose a new and consistent view of the mechanisms, firmly grounded in structural information. The computational approach is well suited here because it allows the direct investigation
 Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and M. lepromatosis, affects primarily the skin and peripheral nervous system. The immune response to leprosy varies from paucibacillary tuberculoid to multibacillary lepromatous disease, depending on the quality of the immune response, which is influenced by genetic variants and environmental factors. Complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role in the entrance of mycobacteria into macrophages by binding C3b/C4b complement fragments deposited on opsonized bacteria. In a case-control study, CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels were investigated in Brazilian leprosy patients to understand the role of this receptor in susceptibility to the disease.Nine SNPs were genotyped in 213 leprosy patients and 297 controls, and mRNA levels and sCR1 levels were measured in up to 80 samples. Individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype, harboring rs3849266*T in intron 21 and rs3737002*T in exon 26, presented twice higher susceptibility to leprosy (OR = 2.43, p = 0.017). Paucibacillary patients with these variants presented lower sCR1 levels, reducing the anti-inflammatory response (p = 0.040 and p = 0.046, respectively). The most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form (OR = 3.04, p = 0.01) and presented the intronic rs12034383*G allele, which was associated with higher gene expression (p = 0.043). Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between the levels of sCR1 and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) (R = -0.52, p = 0.007).The results suggest a regulatory role for CR1 polymorphisms on mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation. Functional investigations on phagocytic efficiency of the associated haplotypes would help clarify the role of this receptor in the disease and possibly lead to novel therapeutic strategies.Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease that primarily affects individuals in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nepal, and Nigeria. In Brazil, the state with the highest prevalence is Mato Grosso (9.03 cases/10,000 inhabitants). Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae and M. lepromatosis and primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, later reaching other organs and systems. The clinical diversity of leprosy relies on the quality of the immune response, which itself results from genetic variants of the host and environmental factors. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified polymorphisms in interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2), and human leukocyte antigens–antigen D related (HLA-DR) genes as associated with susceptibility to the disease. Polymorphisms of genes associated with Parkinson (Parkin–PARK2, parkin coregulated–PACRG, and superoxide dismutase 2 –SOD2) and Alzheimer diseases (SOD2) also modulate susceptibility to leprosy in independent populations.The complement system includes 47 proteins and protein fragments that activate, coordinate, and regulate a proinflammatory, proteolytic cascade of the immune response. Altered expression and functional deficiency of complement components modulate susceptibility to diseases. Genetic variants that reduce complement activation or complement-mediated recognition of opsonized elements may enhance resistance against pathogens that depend on phagocytosis to initiate infection, as mycobacteria. They may also decrease inflammation at skin and nerve injuries. Several polymorphisms of genes of the complement system are associated with leprosy: mannose-binding lectin (MBL2), ficolins (FCN1, FCN2, and FC
 Metagenomic sequencing using next-generation technology holds great promise for human infection diagnosis by capturing all DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of sequences depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, but contamination in published genomes poses a challenge, increasing the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this issue, a bioinformatics system was developed to eliminate contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens.The system uses a pipeline that splits each genome into 100bp overlapping pseudo-reads, which are then compared to three unique databases using Kraken and Bowtie2. Kraken labels reads with exact 31-mer matches to any sequence in the database, while Bowtie2 aligns reads against any reference sequence with gaps or mismatches. Any pseudo-read classified or aligned in these steps represents either contaminating sequences or low-complexity sequences that match distant species by chance. These sequences could lead to false positive identifications in metagenomics analysis. Therefore, any portion of a database genome that corresponds to a pseudo-read classified or aligned in the previous steps is masked.To evaluate the effectiveness of the database cleaning method for NGS diagnosis of human infections, a set of 20 human cornea samples was tested against the EuPathDB-clean database. The results showed that the original EuPathDB and RefSeq EuPathDB databases yielded false positive signals due to contamination, while the Microbe database, which includes EuPathDB-clean, produced accurate results. The new database significantly improved the sensitivity for identifying true positive eukaryotic infections while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.In conclusion, metagenomic sequencing using next-generation technology holds great potential for human infection diagnosis. However, the accuracy of the results heavily relies on the quality and completeness of reference databases. Contamination in published genomes poses a significant challenge, but a comprehensive contamination removal process can create a much cleaner database that minimizes false positives and provides better identification of true positive pathogens in NGS diagnostic samples.
 The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes important for coronary artery disease (CAD) using whole-genome expression profiles from multiple organs. The study used a two-way clustering approach to analyze gene expression data from five CAD-relevant tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, atherosclerotic arterial wall, and internal mammary artery (IMA). The analysis revealed a module of 128 genes, called the A-module, which was enriched with genetic risk for CAD and involved the TEML pathway. Parts of the A-module were active in both atherosclerotic arterial wall and visceral fat, suggesting a local source of inflammation contributing to coronary atherosclerosis. The study also identified LDB2 as a putative high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, which was robustly expressed in all major lesion cell types both in lesion-free and in late atherosclerosis lesions. Key genes in the TEML pathway were differentially regulated in the arterial wall of Ldb2-deficient mice, further supporting the importance of the A-module in atherosclerosis development. The findings suggest that the A-module, including LDB2, is important in the regulation of TEML and in atherosclerosis development. The STAGE study used a top-down systems biological approach to identify gene networks or groups of functionally associated genes (modules) of importance for disease severity. The study identified 60 tissue clusters, two of which related to the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. Although this might appear to be a small fraction, these clusters may relate to tissue physiology or subtraits of CABG patients. The study also used two different atherosclerosis cohorts for exploration and confirmation, adding credibility to the confirmatory step and ruling out the possibility that any of the tissue clusters identified in the STAGE cohort was a result of the exploratory study design. The extents of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis have repeatedly been shown to be highly correlated, and atherosclerosis development and the principal molecular processes underlying this development have been found to be very similar in all major arteries, regardless of location. The study also identified LDB2 as a potential regulator of TEML genes in general and specifically as a regulator of A-module genes. The findings suggest that the A-module, including LDB2, is important in the regulation of TEML and in atherosclerosis development. The clinical usefulness and exact role in CAD of this module and its high-hierarchy regulator LDB2 merit further investigation.
 In the present work, the authors investigated the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on human visual perception using multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches. They revealed that each perceptual report is influenced by opposite biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes: low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, while decisional traces attract perceptual reports toward the recent past. The authors propose a unified account of serial dependence, where functionally distinct mechanisms promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.The authors conducted a series of experiments to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. Their results showed that past decisions attract perceptual reports toward the recent past, while stimulus-driven serial dependence disappears when participants are instructed to withhold their response. After streaks of nonreported orientations, positive serial dependence was still dictated by the most recent perceptual decision, demonstrating the dependency on previous decisions rather than physical stimuli.The authors propose a hierarchical model of short-term dependencies, where repulsive biases emerge as a result of low-level adaptation and positive serial dependence arises from the reverberation of internal templates reflecting the reading-out of sensory signals from higher-level decision integrators. They suggest that rapid negative aftereffects in response to task-irrelevant stimuli promote exquisite perceptual sensitivity to relevant environmental changes, while decisional traces reflect the reinstatement of the most informative sensory channels in the recent past, increasing the efficiency of decisional templates over the long term.
 This study examines the convergent evolution of swimming patterns in a diverse group of aquatic animals, specifically those that use median/paired fins. The researchers found that the optimal specific wavelength (OSW) for swimming with elongated fins is around twenty times the mean amplitude, regardless of the animal's size or phylum. This OSW maximizes the force generated by the body, leading to increased swimming speed. The researchers hypothesize that this optimality arises due to the friction and velocity mechanisms of fin surface interaction with the water. The findings challenge the idea that the laws of physics limit the number of good solutions in evolution and suggest that convergent evolution may be driven by a combination of physical principles and developmental constraints. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for controlling robots with undulating fins.
 Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers, and there is a strong interest in developing new means to prevent HPV infections. HPVs infect stratified epithelia, and their life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation state of the epithelium they infect. Progeny virus is only made in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment. HPVs must first establish their infection within the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but why this is necessary has not been well understood.Recent studies using chemical biology approaches have revealed that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. Specifically, cells must pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. This finding provides one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia. Only this compartment of the epithelium contains cells progressing through the cell cycle, and therefore it is only in these cells that HPVs can establish their infection.These findings have important implications for HPV control. By defining a major condition for cell susceptibility to HPV infection, these results provide new leads for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies against HPV infection. For example, cell cycle inhibitors such as etoposide and aphidicolin have been identified as effective inhibitors of HPV infection in vitro. Further studies are needed to determine if these drugs can be used to prevent HPV infection in vivo.In summary, HPVs are pathogens that selectively infect undifferentiated basal cells of stratified epithelia. Recent studies have revealed that cell cycle progression through mitosis, and specifically events in early prophase, is critical for establishing HPV infection. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which HPV infects cells and have important implications for HPV control.
 Orofacial clefting, which includes cleft lip and palate, is a common birth defect with both genetic and environmental components. The genetic etiology of this condition is incompletely understood, but recent studies have identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene as a cause of syndromic orofacial clefting. HYAL2 encodes hyaluronidase 2, which degrades extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. Mutations in the HYAL2 gene result in a destabilized molecule and reduced protein levels, leading to craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, cor triatriatum sinister, and hearing loss in humans and mice. These findings demonstrate the importance of hyaluronan turnover for normal human and mouse development.
 The developing human brain is susceptible to hypoxic injury, leading to chronic neurodevelopmental impairments. Recent studies in zebrafish have revealed that hypoxia disrupts axon pathfinding in the developing central nervous system (CNS), specifically in the formation of the tract of the commissure of the posterior tuberculum (TCPT). This disruption is due to the activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway and the subsequent upregulation of ephrinB2a. The ephrinB2a receptor, ephA4a, is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons. By targeting a constitutively active form of ephrinB2a to specific neurons, it was found that ephrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Magnesium sulfate, which is used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2a. These findings suggest that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia, and support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium.
 Filarial nematodes, such as Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, form a mutualistic relationship with the endosymbiont Wolbachia. Depletion of Wolbachia leads to profound defects in nematode development, fertility, and viability, making it a promising approach for treating filarial diseases. However, the basis for this mutualistic relationship is not well understood. In this study, whole mount confocal microscopy was used to observe the consequences of Wolbachia depletion on host nematode cellular and nuclear structure. The results reveal an extensive and profound development of apoptosis in germline cells and embryos following antibiotic depletion of Wolbachia. Apoptosis occurs soon after bacterial depletion in B. malayi and is sustained for at least 21 months in O. volvulus. Apoptosis is even observed in cells that had not been infected with Wolbachia prior to antibiotic treatment. Nuclear structure in most somatic tissues remains intact, but disruption of cytoskeleton arrangement occurs in the lateral chord cells, where the vast majority of the bacteria reside. The Wolbachia present in the female lateral chords may therefore have a more important role than in males, and their contribution may be crucial to avoid apoptosis during female germline and embryonic development. The loss of Wolbachia in somatic tissues does not lead to apoptosis of the lateral chord cells, but the cortical microtubule network is disrupted in treated females, which may impair the chords' function in supplying nutrients/metabolites to the germline and developing embryos. In vitro doxycycline treatment confirmed that the in vivo tetracycline-induced Wolbachia depletion could cause apoptosis independently of any mammalian host-derived factors. The increase in apoptosis in released microfilariae was not as extensive as in intrauterine 'stretched' microfilariae, and further experiments using isolated microfilariae only infections are planned to confirm this observation. The results are consistent with previous observations on the effect of Wolbachia depletion on microfilarial viability and transmission. The majority of microfilariae depleted of Wolbachia retain their motility and viability in the mammalian host but their ability to develop in the vector is compromised. The mechanism by which Wolbachia suppresses apoptosis remains unclear, but it may be achieved either by direct targeting of the apoptotic signaling cascade or indirectly by influencing host metabolism. Further studies to define the process by which Wolbachia regulates host nematode apoptosis may provide alternative targets to screen for drugs or biomarkers of anti-Wolbachia activity, which could yield alternative and improved therapeutic options for the control and elimination of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.
 This study aimed to test the hypothesis that tissue tropism plays an important role in selecting transmissible reassortants from various reassortants generated in pigs co-infected with avian and swine influenza A viruses (IAVs). The study used feral swine as the animal model and identified 30 of 254 possible reassortant genotypes between an avian H1N1 IAV and a swine H3N2 IAV, with most detected in middle and lower respiratory tracts. The results showed that tissue tropism could have selected which reassortant viruses were shed from the pigs. The findings illustrate how transmissible reassortants arise between avian and swine IAVs in pigs and could help identify transmissible reassortants with public health risks.The animal experiments were conducted under Biosafety Level 2 conditions and involved the use of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, human alveolar adenocarcinoma (A549) cells, chicken embryo fibroblasts (DF-1), and SNE and STE cells. The viruses were propagated on MDCK cells and titrated by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) on MDCK cells and the 50% egg culture infective dose (EID50) on SPF 10-day-old chicken embryonated eggs. Viral RNA was extracted and viral cDNA transcript libraries were prepared and sequenced using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 with a MiSeq sequencing system. Polymorphisms were identified from alignments and subjected to a 20% coverage cutoff.The study found that the reassortants detected in middle and lower respiratory tracts showed large variations in growth properties in SNE at 33°C and STE at 37°C, but the reassortants detected in nasal wash fluids and turbinate could replicate well in SNE at 33°C and in STE at 37°C. These results suggest that tissue tropism contributes to the unbalanced distribution of reassortants through swine respiratory tract tissues.Receptor binding properties have been reported to be one of the key factors determining IAV host and tissue tropisms, but the results from this study suggest that other gene segments, such as the ribonucleoprotein complex and NS gene, could interact with the host genes and formulate such tissue tropisms. Influenza surveillance showed that a large number of genetic variants of subtype H1 and H3 IAVs are co-circulating and enzootic in domestic swine in the United States, and these reassortants can have large variation in tissue tropisms and transmissibility in mammals. Thus, genetic constellation is an important factor determining influenza tissue and host tropisms.In conclusion, the study findings illustrate how transmissible reassortants arise between avian and swine IAVs in pigs and could help identify transmissible reassortants with public health risks. The results demonstrate the importance of tissue tropism in selecting transmissible reassortants and highlight the role of feral swine as a potential intermediate host for generating and transmitting reassortant viruses containing both avian and swine influenza virus genes to domestic swine and ultimately to humans.
 The Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 plays a role in promoting adaptation to the DNA damage checkpoint by attenuating the checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation. The process of adaptation occurs when cells are presented with persistent or irreparable DNA damage and escape the cell-cycle arrest imposed by the DNA damage checkpoint. The precise mechanism of adaptation remains unknown, but it is dose-dependent on Cdc5 and its overexpression promotes faster adaptation.Cdc5 acts to inhibit the checkpoint at the step of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, as shown by a decrease in Rad53 phosphorylation and a loss of Rad53-dependent cell-cycle arrest. The early steps of checkpoint activation, including checkpoint sensor localization and Mec1-phosphorylation of Rad9, remain mostly unaffected by Cdc5 overproduction. However, the damage-induced interaction between phosphorylated Rad9 and Rad53 is significantly reduced, indicating that Cdc5 acts to disrupt this interaction and promote adaptation.The mechanism by which Cdc5 inhibits Rad53 hyperphosphorylation is not fully understood, but it is independent of the phosphatases Ptc2 and Ptc3. Cdc5 may act by disrupting Rad9 function without blocking Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation of Rad9, as Rad9 multimerization is not affected by Cdc5 overexpression.Cdc5's kinase activity is necessary for its ability to inactivate checkpoint signaling, as shown by a decrease in Rad53 phosphorylation when Cdc5 is overexpressed or when using the kinase-defective allele cdc5-K110A. The cdc5-ad allele, which has a leucine mutated to a tryptophan at residue 251, shows a later and less robust decrease in Rad53 phosphorylation compared to CDC5 induction, consistent with its reduced ability to promote checkpoint adaptation.In summary, Cdc5 promotes adaptation to DNA damage by inhibiting the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage despite the presence of a persistent checkpoint signal. The mechanism by which Cdc5 inhibits Rad53 hyperphosphorylation is not fully understood, but it is independent of the phosphatases Ptc2 and Ptc3 and requires Cdc5 kinase activity.
 This study focuses on the persistent perceptual alternations following the build-up phase of auditory streaming, a phenomenon where the initial perception of integrated or segregated streams switches back and forth over long stimulus presentations. The authors develop a neuromechanistic model of auditory bistability that accurately reproduces the dynamics of these alternations. The model is based on a three-population network, with each population pooling inputs from regions of A1 centered at frequencies A, B, and (A+B)/2. The model includes cortical dynamics, spike frequency adaptation, NMDA-excitation, and slow depression of excitation. The authors validate the model by comparing its predictions with psychophysical experiments and show that it accurately captures the dependence of mean dominance durations on the tone frequency difference. The study also explores the relationship between attention and auditory bistability and provides a platform for further investigations into the mechanisms of attention in auditory streaming.
 This study explores the use of rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, as a marking technique for male Aedes aegypti in the context of sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT) control strategies. Rhodamine B was administered to males through sugar-feeding, resulting in successful body and seminal fluid marking with minimal impact on male survival and mating competitiveness. The marking persisted through the reported life expectancy of released males and was transferred to wild females during field releases, as well as the recapture of marked males. Rhodamine B marking is a potentially useful tool for SIT/IIT programs to measure male mating efficacy and a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments. As a standalone method for use in mating competitiveness assays, rhodamine B marking is less expensive and less time-consuming than alternative methods such as PCR, stable isotope marking, or female fertility assays. However, the longevity of the mark is contingent upon males not sugar-feeding soon after release, and further investigations into the effect of multiple sugar-feedings on male marking and survival are warranted. Overall, rhodamine B marking is an economical and rapid evaluation method for male-based control strategies and has the potential to enable operators to determine the efficacy of their control method quickly and easily, allowing them to optimize releases to achieve optimal population suppression. However, small-scale field MRR experiments are recommended to obtain more accurate estimates of male survival and mark persistence prior to adoption for operational assessments, and comparisons to classical marking techniques such as fluorescent powders would benefit the understanding of the utility of rhodamine B body marking in male-focused survival and dispersal studies.
 Boophilin is a multifunctional protease inhibitor expressed in the midgut of the tick Rhipicephalus microplus, which inhibits thrombin, plasmin, and elastase, with residual activity towards kallikrein and FVIIa. It inhibits thrombin in a non-canonical manner, despite possessing a canonical reactive site loop. Boophilin's importance is demonstrated by the 20% reduction in egg weight production when its gene is silenced. This effect might be due to inhibition of midgut proteases initiating and sustaining inflammatory reactions, which are detrimental to tick survival.Boophilin expressed in HEK293 cells behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to small chromogenic substrates, with a Ki ~ 100 nM. It inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and fibrin formation in vitro. Boophilin does not inhibit the amidolytic activity of γ-thrombin or interact with γ-thrombin by SPR. However, PPACK-thrombin retains its ability to interact with the inhibitor. The crystal structure determination of Boophilin reveals that residues in the N-terminal interact with the catalytic site of thrombin while the C-terminal Kunitz domain binds to the anion binding exosite-1.Boophilin interferes with the contact pathway through different mechanisms: i) Boophilin is a classical and non-competitive inhibitor of FXIa with a Ki ~ 100 nM, which inhibits FIX activation, providing direct evidence that Boophilin blocks the coagulation cascade by interfering with FIXa production. ii) Boophilin also partially prevents kallikrein amidolytic activity and the reciprocal activation without affecting FXIIa. iii) Boophilin interacts productively with kallikrein to prevent inflammatory reactions.Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis, and several proteases besides thrombin are known to modulate platelet function and contribute to thrombosis through release of poly-phosphates, which amplifies FXI activation by thrombin in the contact pathway. Furthermore, platelet cross-talk with neutrophils is associated with NETs formation, a critical player in FXII activation in vivo. Neutrophils also release cathepsin-G that promotes PAR activation and thrombosis and elastase that potentiates platelet aggregation by other agonists and cleaves TFPI. Neutrophil activation also takes place through the complement cascade, which is activatable by plasmin. Here, we found that Boophilin inhibits plasmin- and cathepsin G-induced platelet aggregation and partially attenuates elastase activity, according to degradation of TFPI in vitro.Altogether, these results suggest that Boophilin interrupts the platelet-neutrophil axis associated with thrombosis, shifting the hemostatic system towards an anti-coagulant phenotype. This contention was verified through testing the effects of Boophilin in vivo, using the FeCl3 carotid artery thrombosis model. FeCl3 causes endothelial cell injury, with exposure of pro-hemostatic sub-endothelial matrix leading to thrombus formation. Our experiments demonstrated that Boophilin effectively inhibits vessel occlusion under our experimental conditions with prolongation of the bleeding time. The antithrombotic effect of Boophilin is likely the result of inhibiting multiple targets, including thrombin, FXIa, and enzymes associated with neutrophils and platelets. However, the relative contribution of each enzyme inhibition in the antithrombotic properties of Boophilin in vivo remains to be determined.One explanation for why midgut Boophilin behaves as a multifunctional, relatively weak inhibitor, with low specificity, might be that in the midgut, the coagulation and inflammatory reactions are no longer under control of endogenous inhibitors involved in the regulation of proteolytic cascades. In its absence, pro-hemostatic/inflammatory pathways are severely unbalanced and activated in the midgut. Attenuation of only one enzyme in the midgut would not suffice to prevent inflamm
 Dosage compensation in mammals is achieved through doubling X-linked gene expression in both sexes and X inactivation in females. The mechanism controlling X up-regulation may involve DNA sequence-based and/or epigenetic mechanisms. To investigate X expression adjustment in response to ploidy, expression arrays were used to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells. Triploid cells with one active X had lower overall X-linked gene expression compared to diploid cells, while those with two active X's had higher expression. However, the expression of individual genes varied, suggesting that not all genes respond to a change in ploidy in the same manner. The absolute level of autosomal gene expression did not differ between triploid and diploid cells, indicating that gene expression is strictly proportional to the number of autosomal sets. In triploid cells with one active X, X expression is adjusted upward from a basic doubling, presumably mediated by an epigenetic mechanism that senses X expression but does not respond to the simple X:A genomic ratio. This mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose expression dosage in relation to autosomal expression is critical. The results suggest that XYY triploid cultures have a deficiency in expression of genes that escape X inactivation compared to XXX triploid cultures, which could contribute to the early lethality of XYY triploid fetuses. Understanding the mechanisms involved in X up-regulation in mammals will require further investigation at early embryonic stages.
 The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. While previous gene-knockout studies have identified factors involved in this transformation, it remains unclear how these factors are regulated to coordinate the switch. Investigating morphogenetic control by post-translational phosphorylation has provided important regulatory insights into this process, specifically focusing on the coordinated control by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28.The Fkh2 transcription factor was identified as a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. In stationary phase yeast cells, 2D gel electrophoresis shows a diverse pool of Fkh2 phospho-isoforms, and for a short window on hyphal induction, the phosphorylation profile is transformed before reverting to the yeast profile. This transformation does not occur when stationary phase cells are reinoculated into fresh medium supporting yeast growth. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1, and substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile.Transcript profiling of the phosphorylation site mutant revealed that the hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. These changes in gene expression resulted in corresponding defects in pathogenic processes. Furthermore, Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity.Thus, a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event has been discovered that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.
 This study aimed to elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress using live-cell fluorescence microscopy and TIRF microscopy. The researchers found that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles, and Rab GTPases, including Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a, are present on the virus secretory vesicle. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is most frequently near patches of LL5β, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. The findings suggest that the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress are linked, and Rab proteins play crucial roles in this process.
 This study establishes a positive correlation between the antigenic variations of human influenza viruses and the excess mortality they cause. The researchers used a simplified virus-host interaction model to analyze the antigenic strains of human influenza viruses A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B, and found that the ability of a virus to cause disease, as reflected in its virus isolation rate, largely determines its ability to cause death. The study also developed a computational approach, EADpred, to predict antigenic distances between A (H1N1) viral strains based on their HA sequences, enabling rapid assessment of the potential impact of an influenza virus on human death even before infection occurs. The findings will help develop timely and sensible preparedness programs to balance public health gains and social and economic costs. The data sources included HI data, HA sequences, US mortality data, US population data, and other surveillance data regarding influenza in the US. The antigenic strains were defined based on vaccine strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) or reference strains used by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The antigenic distance between two strains was calculated based on HI data using the Archetti-Horsfall method. The excess all-cause mortalities for seasons 1977–2008 were calculated using Simonsen's method. The estimation of excess mortality attributed to an antigenic strain in a given period was based on the virus isolation rate, the proportion of clinical samples that were tested positive for the antigenic strain in the given period. The study analyzed the correlation between antigenic variation and excess mortality for all three subtypes of human influenza viruses, A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B, in the flu seasons from 1977–2009. The researchers found that the antigenic distances between an antigenic strain and its previous antigenic strains were strongly correlated with the total excess all-cause mortalities caused by the antigenic strains. The study also compared the correlation between antigenic distance and excess all-cause mortality to the correlation between genetic distance and excess all-cause mortality. The development of EADpred consisted of four steps: identification of antigenic epitopes, transformation of amino acid changes into changes in physicochemical properties, integration of the contributions of the six derived antigenic epitopes to predict antigenic distance, and model parameterization and assessment. The study was carried out using the statistical package R and compared the performance of EADpred to one of the best previous site-based methods.
 In a study to determine if Leishmania parasites of different species could survive and multiply within each other's parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs), macrophages were infected with both Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major. Leishmania are dimorphic trypanosomatid parasites that induce cutaneous, muco-cutaneous, or visceral disease in humans and other animals. Elongated, proliferating extracellular promastigote forms colonize the midgut of sandfly vectors and differentiate into infective, stationary phase metacyclic promastigotes that can be released into the dermis of mammalian hosts. Macrophages and other mammalian cells internalize infective promastigotes within PVs, in which parasites differentiate into smaller, internally flagellated, oval-shaped amastigote forms. Leishmania PVs are bound by a membrane and undergo compositional changes as they fuse with late endosomes/lysosomes and possibly with other vesicles.Macrophages infected with L. amazonensis were superinfected with L. major amastigotes or promastigotes, and the formation and fate of chimeric PVs were investigated. While L. major amastigotes were excluded from L. amazonensis PVs, L. major promastigotes were delivered into L. amazonensis PVs where they survived and multiplied but did not differentiate into amastigote forms. In contrast, L. major promastigotes sheltered in their own unfused PVs either died or differentiated into amastigotes. The mechanisms underlying the lack of fusion of incoming L. major amastigote-containing PVs with preformed L. amazonensis PVs and the permissiveness of the latter for fusion with L. major promastigote-carrying PVs remain to be elucidated. The study highlights the importance of continuous live recordings in studies of intracellular parasitism and provides insights into the interactions between different Leishmania species within host cells.
 This study investigates the importance of insulin signaling in the growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production of adult Schistosoma japonicum using the insulin receptors (SjIRs) cloned from this parasite. Biolayer Interferometry was used to show that human insulin can bind the L1 subdomain (insulin binding domain) of recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2, and RNA interference (RNAi) was employed to knock down the expression of SjIRs in adult S. japonicum. The results showed that the transcription levels of other important downstream genes within the insulin pathway, associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity, were also impacted significantly. Furthermore, a decrease in glucose uptake was observed in SjIR-knockdown worms compared with luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, rSjLD1 and rSjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These findings re-emphasize the potential of the SjIRs as veterinary transmission blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and animal experimentation was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.
 The study explores the functional link between HIV-1 Nef and Env, specifically investigating how Nef affects HIV-1 sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies targeting distinct features of Env. Nef was found to confer resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, two potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) targeting the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of TMgp41, but had no effect on HIV-1 neutralization by other reagents. This resistance was observed with Nef from a diverse range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. The activity requires Nef myristoylation but is genetically separable from other Nef functions. Glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV substituted for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. The data is consistent with a model in which Nef alters MPER recognition in the context of the virion membrane, as Nef and Glycosylated-Gag decreased the efficiency of virion capture by 2F5 and 4E10, but not by other nAbs. Overall, the study demonstrates that Nef protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies, with important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
 The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a eukaryotic enzyme responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA) using a DNA template. The transcription process involves the formation of a transcription bubble, where the template DNA strand separates and bends, leaving a DNA strand exposed as the template for mRNA synthesis. Nucleotides need to diffuse into the active site for incorporation into the mRNA strand. Two possible entry routes for nucleotides have been proposed: the secondary channel and the main channel.Crystallographic structures of Pol II have been useful in understanding the structural basis of transcription, but the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the full transcription bubble is still unknown. Gaining structural information of the full transcription bubble is crucial for understanding the Pol II transcription process and the possible routes for nucleotide entry.In this study, researchers built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and structural analysis to shed light on nucleotide entry pathways. They found that although both channels have enough space to allow nucleotide loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for nucleotide loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel.Further energetic study based on MD simulations with nucleotides loaded in the channels revealed that the diffusion of nucleotides through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the nucleotides and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. These findings suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for nucleotide entry during Pol II transcription.
 This study investigates the influence of contextual bars on the perception of a target bar in visual object recognition. Human observers judged whether a target bar was present at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without contextual bars. The results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when the context had a weaker rather than stronger contrast, and when the context could perceptually group well with the target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounted for the data, illustrating that context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The data suggest that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences. The study used simple stimuli of bars, easy to manipulate and describe, and revealed that weaker colinear contexts induce stronger biases to fill-in the missing target, contrary to the expectation from previous findings of contextual facilitation on input sensitivities. The Bayesian model successfully fit the data using only three parameters, demonstrating the adequacy of the account.
 LlpABW is a bacteriocin produced by Pseudomonas putida BW11M1, which belongs to the monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) family. It consists of two MMBL domains, N-domain and C-domain, connected by a β-hairpin extension. The N-domain and C-domain exhibit pseudo-threefold symmetry and share a common β-prism fold. The C-terminal β-hairpin extension is highly bent due to a β-bulge inserted into its second β-strand and is absent in plant representatives. The two domains are connected by a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds, and interactions between the C-terminal Val140-Asp145 stretch of the C-domain and the N-terminal Val115-Asp118 and side chains of Ser15 and Pro32 of the N-domain. The crystal structure of LlpABW reveals that it has an affinity of 2.1 mM for the pentasaccharide GlcNAcβ (1–2) Manα (1–3) [GlcNAcβ (1–2) Manα (1–6)]Man, the highest among all the tested oligo-mannosides. The mutations in the conserved valine residue of the QxDxNxVxY motifs in LlpABW did not affect its overall structure, but the mutations in the IIIC site strongly diminished its activity. The lack of electron density at the site IIC in the Me-Man soak indicates that this site does not recognize this ligand or that its affinity is so low that recognition would only be achieved in the context of a larger and as yet unidentified mannose-containing ligand. The N-domain appears to play a major role in target selection, as demonstrated by assessing the differential activity of domain chimers against two target strains, diagnostic for the LlpABW- and LlpA1-specific killing. The β-hairpin does not appear to be a specificity determinant, although it constitutes the most variable region among LlpA-like bacteriocins. Possibly, it is required for thermodynamic stability since it needs to be intact in LlpABW. An equivalent C-terminal stretch is absent from the Xanthomonas citri LlpA-like bacteriocin. LlpABW as a bactericidal protein fits within the picture of MMBL domains being involved in general defense mechanisms, as some of these plant lectins trigger apoptosis in cancer cells, and their identification in fish mucus and epithelial cells is in line with a general protective (antimicrobial) function for MMBL domains.
