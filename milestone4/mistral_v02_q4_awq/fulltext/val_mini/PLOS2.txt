 The study aimed to optimize a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for discovering new compounds that inhibit Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. A 2000-compound library was screened using a T. cruzi strain stably expressing the β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene, and three hits (PCH1, NT1, and CX1) were identified based on their high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells. Each compound exhibited distinct mechanisms of action against intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes, with CX1 showing strong trypanocidal activity, NT1 having a trypanostatic effect, and PCH1 affecting parasite division. The three hits also demonstrated high activity against intracellular T. cruzi from the Y strain and against related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. Two additional compounds (PCH6 and CX2) were selected based on their IC50 values, which were approximately 100 times lower than those of current drugs used against T. cruzi. The results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
 Bistability, a property of dynamical systems that allows for the coexistence of two stable equilibria, plays a central role in various essential biological functions, including cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. Establishing the network topologies that exhibit bistability remains a challenge due to the vast variety of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that exist for even a small number of components. To address this problem, researchers employed chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity for bistability in more than 40,000 simple networks formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins.The study found that approximately 90% of these GRN models exhibit reaction rate constants leading to bistability, including several circuits that do not contain any TF cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems. Eleven minimal bistable networks were identified, which are bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable subnetwork. The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution.Using experimental protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, researchers demonstrated the predictive power of a systematic theoretical survey in identifying bistable modules in organisms that have not been fully explored from a functional genomics perspective. The results are further suggestive of a role for parameter-free modeling in simplifying the study of complex regulatory networks, understanding network evolution, and designing new synthetic biological circuits.The study assumed classical chemical kinetics and specified GRNs as sets of elementary biochemical reactions, including basal protein production and degradation, protein dimerization, and binding of TF monomers and dimers to gene promoters. Using CRNT, researchers identified 18,352 networks out of 40,680 that have the capacity for multiple steady states, with 14,721 of these being confirmed as bistable with example rate constants. The study also identified 2,654 networks that cannot be bistable regardless of the parameter values and 19,674 networks for which the capacity for multiple steady states could not be established or ruled out. The fraction of networks of a given size that are unknown increases as the size increases.The study identified two smallest bistable networks, each containing seven reactions, which can be grown into new eight-reaction networks through the addition of reactions from the set of 23 additional reactions. The study also demonstrated that bistability, once established in a parent network, is not guaranteed in any descendant network but can be established if the stoichiometric subspace of the descendant network is identical to that of the parent.The study used the results of the in silico analysis to motivate a search of existing yeast protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction data and identified a number of two-gene systems with topologies consistent with bistability. The study emphasized that while the two-gene networks identified through the analysis are not guaranteed to be bistable, their known topologies and functions make them excellent bistable network candidates, providing powerful hypotheses for further experimentation. The same approach may be used to provide guidance or functional context to any system for which the necessary interaction data is available.High-throughput parameter-free analysis holds potential as a tool for the study of natural systems and as a design aid in the growing field of synthetic biology. The study proposed a set of novel bistable networks that lack cooperativity and may be particularly good designs as a result. At the very least, such a broad application of CRNT may be used to rule out circuits incapable of bistability or those which cannot exhibit sustained oscillations or absolute concentration robustness. However, it is worth emphasizing that the region of parameter space supporting bistability in any individual network cannot be determined via parameter-free techniques alone. Once identified, potentially interesting network architectures may be analyzed in more detail with rate constants chosen by Monte Carlo sampling of parameter space.
 Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by filarial parasites, leading to lymphedema and elephantiasis. The pathogenesis of this disease involves both parasite-induced lymphatic dysfunction and immune-mediated responses. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) play a crucial role in lymphatic function, and their interactions with filarial parasites and antigens have been studied in vitro.Human LEC were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected patient serum to evaluate their response. Live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Serum from patently infected individuals with microfilariae or chronic lymphatic obstruction also induced significantly increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. Differentiation of LEC into tube-like networks was associated with significantly increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their TIMP inhibitors.Microarray analysis revealed that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways, decreasing trans-endothelial transport. The data suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis.
 Plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria use transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) to activate target genes in host cells, which support bacterial virulence. TALEs have a unique DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats, each containing repeat variable diresidues (RVDs) that determine target specificity. In this study, a novel approach called PrediTALE is proposed for TALE target prediction, which accounts for recent findings on TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths and the flexible strand orientation of target boxes. PrediTALE can improve prediction performance compared to previous approaches, as demonstrated using RNA-seq data from rice infected with Xanthomonas. However, some TALEs were found to have no predicted targets, which are termed orphan TALEs. The authors suggest that this may be due to incomplete gene annotations and propose replacing promoterome-wide scans for target boxes with genome-wide scans. Using genome-wide scans, known targets were recovered, and new putative targets were identified, some of which were independent of existing gene annotations. Overall, PrediTALE is a valuable tool for accurately predicting TALE target boxes and identifying virulence targets, which is essential for understanding plant-pathogen interactions.
 The OmpR regulatory protein of Gram-negative bacteria plays a crucial role in governing gene networks that enable adaptation to various niches, including pathogenic interactions with host organisms. While the DNA binding protein OmpR is identical between Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, regulatory specialization has led to different environmental triggers and largely divergent OmpR regulons. For instance, ompR mRNA and protein levels are elevated by acid pH in S. Typhimurium but not in E. coli, due to differences in the promoter regions of the ompR genes. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium overlaps that of E. coli at only 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes, such as virulence genes, that E. coli does not have. OmpR binds to its genomic targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, which is a requirement for optimal expression of its virulence genes. The genomic targets of OmpR do not share a strong nucleotide sequence consensus, and the ability of OmpR to recruit additional genes to its regulon arises from its modest requirements for specificity in its DNA targets and its preference for relaxed DNA, allowing it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress. The relationship between a given regulatory protein and its target genes is subject to evolutionary change, allowing genes to join or to leave a given regulon over time. Four types of variation have been described: changes in the presence/absence and the distribution of binding sites for a common regulatory protein at orthologous targets, genes acquired via lateral transfer coming under the control of a regulator already established in the cell, architectural adjustment of a promoter under the control of a regulator to add or subtract regulatory influence, and changes that affect the DNA binding protein itself. The OmpR DNA binding protein of Gram-negative bacteria has the potential to govern collectives of genes whose membership is subject to change due to its modest specificity for its DNA targets and its ability to respond to more than one environmental signal. This flexibility allows it to participate in regulon evolution from the standpoint of regulatory signal reception. The OmpR/EnvZ two-component system consists of a sensor kinase (EnvZ) and a response regulator DNA binding protein (OmpR), and the EnvZ protein has two trans-membrane helices, a periplasmic domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that undergoes auto-phosphorylation at His-243. Environmental signal transduction involves phosphorylation of OmpR on Asp-55 by EnvZ, and this regulatory system has been shown to transmit an osmotic stress signal in E. coli, among the OmpR targets being the ompF and ompC genes that encode major porin proteins located in the outer membrane. Recent evidence shows that EnvZ senses changes in osmolarity through its cytoplasmic domain. Both S. Typhimurium and E. coli employ general resistance mechanisms that allow them to tolerate external pH values outside the preferred cytoplasmic range. Despite being very closely related at the genetic level, E. coli is much more acid-tolerant than S. Typhimurium. It can survive pH 2 for several hours whereas S. Typhimurium dies rapidly under these conditions. In S. Typhimurium, OmpR plays an important role in infection and ompR knockout mutants are attenuated for virulence in mice. OmpR regulates the transcription of a number of horizontally acquired genes that are not present in E. coli and are key to S. Typhimurium virulence, including the hilC and hilD regulatory genes in the SPI-1 pathogenicity island, a 40-kb genetic element that encodes a type III secretion system and effector proteins required for invasion of mammalian cells, and the ssrA and ssrB genes of the 40-kb SPI-2 pathogenicity island, which encode a two-component system consisting of the sensor kinase (SsrA) and cognate DNA binding protein (SsrB) that regulates the expression of a type III secretion/effector protein system required for intracellular survival and replication of S. Typhimurium inside the acidified vacuolar compartment. Adaptation to the vacuole involves a complicated process of transcription regulation, and this process is modulated by DNA relaxation. Recently, DNA relaxation was shown to enhance the binding of
 Two-component signaling systems, ubiquitous in bacteria, Archaea, and plants, play crucial roles in adaptation to changing environments. Classical systems employ a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue in a receiver (REC) domain. However, some REC domains lack this phosphorylatable Asp residue, and it remains unclear how many of these divergent REC domains exist, what their functional roles are, and how they are regulated. This study compiled all deposited REC domains missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue, named here as the Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains, and analyzed their structures and functions. ALRs are surprisingly common and are enriched for when attached to more rare effector outputs. ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to instead take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. The work defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains.
 The bacterial replication cycle is driven by the DnaA protein, which cycles between the active ATP-bound form and the inactive ADP-bound form. The DnaA protein is also the main controller of initiation frequency, but its accumulation does not determine the time of initiation. In a study using cells with a surplus of ATP-DnaA, no changes in the timing of initiation were observed, suggesting that the amount of ATP-DnaA is not the factor limiting precise timing of initiation. The DnaA protein interacts with various other proteins and factors, such as DiaA and DDAH, to regulate initiation. Loss of DDAH affects the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and makes it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein, indicating that compromised cell cycle machines perform in a less robust manner. Overall, the results suggest that even though the DnaA protein is highly conserved as an initiator and transcription factor, the precise regulatory circuits that govern its activity may not be conserved.
 The rat demyelination (dmy) mutation is a unique model system to investigate myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS) as it causes severe myelin breakdown after normal postnatal completion of myelination. The causative gene for this disorder was identified through positional cloning and found to be Mrs2, which encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria. The dmy mutation results in a novel splice acceptor site, leading to functional inactivation of the mutant allele. MRS2 protein is essential for Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria, and its deficiency in dmy/dmy rats leads to major mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, reduced ATP levels, and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2 is dominantly expressed in neurons and is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Prolonged activation of microglia and elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in dmy/dmy rats at 6-7 weeks of age, suggesting that the demyelination is enhanced by activated microglia and astroglia. The dmy mutation is a loss-of-function mutation of the Mrs2 gene, making it an excellent animal model for investigating the causal relationships between primary mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent demyelination and for developing therapies.
 Leishmaniasis is a significant disease affecting 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases annually. Leishmania amazonensis is a major agent in Brazil, leading to clinical forms ranging from localized to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The effect of the host immune response on Leishmania phenotype and virulence is an intriguing yet rarely analyzed issue. In this study, researchers compared the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice to investigate modifications driven by the host immune response. Among the 44 differentially expressed spots, there were proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases, including known Leishmania virulence factors such as oligopeptidase B and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells probably restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. Conversely, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice. This study may help identify potential virulence factors and ways of regulating their expression.
 This study aimed to expand the current knowledge of cryptococcosis in Thailand by examining 498 clinical, environmental, and veterinary isolates of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex. The majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI, which was the most common molecular type among Thai human, environmental, and animal isolates. However, less frequent molecular types such as VNII, VNIV, VGI, and VGII were also identified. Among the VNI isolates, six M13 types (A, B, C, D, E, and F) were identified, with type A being the most common. MLST analysis of representative strains of each M13 type and all VNII and VNIV isolates identified eight additional sequence types. The Thai C. neoformans isolates were found to be an integral part of the global population structure, with nine STs being unique to Thailand but closely related to other global isolates. Eleven out of the 12 VGII isolates were identical to the genotype of the low virulent Vancouver Island outbreak strains, VGIIb/ST7. Overall, this study revealed a greater genetic diversity among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported and identified Thailand as a stepping-stone in the global spread of the Vancouver Island outbreak strain. Cryptococcosis remains a major problem as an opportunistic infection in Thailand, making further studies on the epidemiology and virulence of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex essential for proper management of the disease in the future.
 Scabies is a neglected infectious disease with a global prevalence of 100-130 million cases per year, causing significant morbidity, particularly in vulnerable populations. Current treatments, including topical agents and oral ivermectin (IVM), have limitations, such as insufficient efficacy and emerging drug resistance. Moxidectin (MOX), another macrocyclic lactone, is a promising alternative due to its better pharmacokinetic profiles. In a preclinical study using a porcine scabies model, MOX (0.3 mg/kg, single dose) was compared to IVM (0.2 mg/kg, two doses) in terms of efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics.At baseline, all groups were comparable in terms of mite counts, clinical scores, pruritus scores, and IgG antibody levels. No clinical signs of intolerance to IVM or MOX were observed during the 47-day observation period. Dexamethasone side effects were mild.MOX treatment resulted in rapid and notable acaricide efficacy of 98-100% seven days post-treatment and 100% from D14 onwards, while IVM-treated pigs had only half of the group cured on D14, and one of the four pigs was still infected at study-end. Clinical scores demonstrated significantly different recovery rates between MOX and IVM or controls. No cutaneous lesions were seen on any of the MOX-treated pigs but only on three of the four given IVM on D47. MOX-treated pigs recovered faster than IVM-treated animals. Pruritus scores declined sharply for both treated groups but more markedly for MOX-treated pigs, although pruritus persisted for several days post-treatment.The serological responses throughout infection and post-treatment were similar to those reported previously. Despite the small animal number, the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes demonstrated that all results converged to demonstrate that MOX was more effective than IVM at every study-time point. The excellent MOX efficacy could be directly reflected by its better pharmacokinetic characteristics: rapid absorption, larger distribution, and remarkably longer persistence in plasma and the skin. MOX remained detectable in plasma and the skin for the entire 47 days of observation post-administration, while IVM was undetectable 7-9 and 12 days post-administration.The study's main strengths were the robustness and trustworthiness of the experimental model, as pigs are a preferred model for investigating skin diseases in translational dermatological research due to their similar epidermal structure and immune systems to humans. The observations successfully replicated the Australian reports for scabies development, including timescale for lesion appearance, pruritus, and infection severity. The model was optimized for this therapeutic trial and standardized infections in all pigs by weighing out the inoculating samples. A new scoring system was created to clinically monitor cutaneous lesions and pruritus.The study highlighted several advantageous characteristics of MOX, including its potential to overcome IVM resistance, longer persistence in the skin, and lack of adverse events. MOX had a wider safety margin when given to Collie dogs, which are hypersensitive to P-glycoprotein substrates. MOX was well-tolerated in healthy human volunteers, and no adverse events were reported in the first phase I study. MOX did not harm eggs, but newly hatched mites may be killed by the long-lasting MOX persisting in the skin, leading to prolonged MOX efficacy. A single dose of MOX might suffice to clear infection, which could increase compliance and be a key determinant of treatment success, particularly in resource-poor communities and care facilities for the elderly, mentally-ill, or disabled patients. MOX is being developed as an alternative treatment for onchocerciasis and is being considered for regulatory authority-submission for human use. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy and dose selection of MOX in humans.
 The study examines the role of type III interferon (IFNλ) and its receptor IL-28R in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the lung. IFNλ is abundantly expressed in the respiratory tract and is essential for host defense against some viral pathogens. However, its role in bacterial infections is not well understood.The study found that both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa induced significant production of IFNλ in the lung, and clearance of these bacteria from the lung was significantly increased in IL-28R null mice compared to controls. This improvement in bacterial clearance was associated with reduced lung pathology and a lower ratio of pro- vs anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway.In human epithelial cells, IFNλ inhibited miR-21 via STAT3, resulting in upregulation of PDCD4, a protein known to promote inflammatory signaling. In vivo, miR-21 was significantly reduced and PDCD4 was increased in the lungs of wild type compared to IL-28R null mice 18 hours following infection with either pathogen. PDCD4 null mice had improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production.These findings suggest that during bacterial pneumonia, IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4. The study also found that SpA, a major surface component protein of S. aureus, and LPS, a component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, both upregulate PDCD4 expression in host cells, leading to increased inflammatory cytokine production.In summary, the study provides evidence that IFNλ plays a role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens in the lung by promoting inflammation through the inhibition of miR-21 regulation of PDCD4. The findings suggest that targeting the IFNλ/PDCD4 regulatory pathway could be a potential therapy for limiting lung damage in the setting of acute airway infection.
 This study builds upon previous research on neural networks with a single plastic layer employing reward modulated spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) for simple foraging tasks, and expands it by demonstrating advanced pattern discrimination and continuous learning in a network of spiking neurons with multiple plastic layers. The network utilized both reward modulated and non-reward modulated STDP and implemented multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization of rewarded STDP, and hard limits on synaptic strength.The addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing non-rewarded STDP created neurons that responded to specific combinations of inputs, allowing for basic classification of the input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network was able to learn discrimination between rewarding patterns and patterns designated as punishing, despite the absence of labeled training data. Synaptic noise allowed for trial-and-error learning, helping to identify goal-oriented strategies effective in task solving.The study predicts a critical set of properties of the spiking neuronal network with STDP that was sufficient to solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision making. Biologically inspired neural networks should be capable of performing sophisticated information processing, and the brain's multilayered information processing and learning capabilities are key to its power and uniqueness. The visual pathway is an example of a sensory pathway where sensory information gets progressively more general, and visual learning occurs at different stages, with different plasticity mechanisms operating at different processing steps. Eventually, sensory information reaches decision centers under the influence of reward signals, and reinforcement can be vital to visual learning. However, it is still not fully understood how learning at the cellular level gives rise to learning at the level of animal behavior.STDP is a promising model of learning at the synaptic level, and it relies on the dopamine modulation of synaptic tags created by STDP. A small number of studies have attempted to perform task learning using rewarded STDP, and the model contains two plastic layers inspired by the pathways known in mammalian brain from sensory to higher order sensory-motor areas responsible for decision making. The first layer of the model uses unsupervised learning to classify the input, while the second layer is responsible for decision making based on rewarded STDP. The network simulated the brain of an agent moving through an unknown environment, continuously learning distinct input patterns of food and adjusting synaptic weights controlling its movement according to the reward and punishment signals based on the shape of the different configurations of food particles that it acquires. The multilayered network combining rewarded and nonrewarded STDP and synaptic regulatory mechanisms is capable of solving a more complex foraging task, involving discrimination between elementary patterns of food, than it was previously reported in networks with only one plastic layer based on rewarded STDP.
 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous disease susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases, but the question remains whether individual disease risk can be quantified based on genotype data for personalized prevention and treatment. Previous studies have failed to achieve satisfactory performance, primarily due to the limited number of confirmed susceptibility loci used. In this study, the authors propose that sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers may improve disease risk assessment.They applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a GWAS dataset for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and optimized a risk assessment model with hundreds of markers. The model was then tested on two independent datasets, achieving area under ROC curve (AUC) scores of approximately 0.84 in both datasets. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when limited to dozens of known susceptibility loci in the SVM model or logistic regression model.The study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers. The authors are optimistic that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays.The authors accessed three T1D GWAS datasets: one from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC), one from the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) study, and one from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Montreal. They used the SVM algorithm and logistic regression (LR) for disease risk assessment and compared their performance.The SVM algorithm achieved higher accuracy than the LR model in all three datasets, with AUC scores ranging from 0.83 to 0.85. The authors also investigated the effect of data differential biases on the performance of the models and found that SVM was less susceptible to these biases than the LR model.The authors conclude that an SVM-based risk assessment algorithm can accommodate differences in training data and generate consistent, robust results across different datasets. They also tested the model on six other disease cohorts from WTCCC and found that it had encouraging specificity values for all diseases except rheumatoid arthritis, which shares some genetic risk factors with T1D.The authors also evaluated several different forms of the risk assessment models by modifying the predictors or the model parameters to better understand the source of the improved performance of the SVM algorithm. They found that the SVM algorithm took into account both main and interaction effects, implying that both genes and their interactions contribute to T1D. They also found that better modeling of LD structure within MHC played a major role in SVM-based risk modeling.The authors envision that low-cost SNP genotyping platforms may have the potential to replace HLA-typing in assessing T1D risk in clinically relevant settings. They also note that the best assessment model and the most optimal number of predictors may depend on the distribution of effect sizes and that diseases such as T1D might represent an extreme example where genotype-based risk assessment is clinically feasible.
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, transmitted by female phlebotomine sandflies. The disease occurs in two clinical forms: cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 2 million cases and 20,000-40,000 deaths occur annually. Brazil is one of the most affected countries, with an estimated 350 million people at risk.In this study, Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models were applied to analyze reported incidence data of CL and VL in Brazil from 2001 to 2010. The models were fitted using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to perform fast approximate Bayesian inference and identify the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors.The results showed that precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were identified as important risk factors for both types of leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (SD: 7,676) for CL and 4,889 (SD: 288) for VL. The highest predicted numbers of infected people were in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively.The spatially explicit, high-resolution incidence maps identified priority areas where leishmaniasis control efforts should be targeted to reduce disease incidence. The generated incidence maps and estimates might be useful for decision-makers to optimize resources allocation and render control and elimination efforts most cost-effective.
 IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression pattern is essential for proper hematopoiesis. IKAROS collaborates with the NuRD complex to promote gene repression and activation. The NuRD complex, initially identified as a repressive complex, also promotes transcription of specific genes through its interaction with IKAROS. IKAROS binds to the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) at gene promoters and assembles a complex with NuRD and P-TEFb, which can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1α), an IKAROS-binding protein and P-TEFb activator, to CDK9. An IKAROS mutant that is unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impedes normal differentiation of IkNULL hematopoietic progenitors. The knock-down of the NuRD subunit Mi2 reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and thereby, promotes transcription elongation. IKAROS interacts with PP1 and is dephosphorylated by this phosphatase, and the IKAROS-PP1 interaction is important for Cdk9/P-TEFb activation and thus, transcription elongation of IKAROS-target genes.
 Mitochondria originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts and their transition to organelles was linked to the establishment of protein import pathways. The initial import of most proteins is mediated by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM). Although TOM is common to all forms of mitochondria, its subunits show unexpected diversity between eukaryotic lineages. In this study, the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically specialized anaerobic form of mitochondria found in the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis, was analyzed. The TvTom40-2 subunit of the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes forms a translocation channel for protein import and is present in high molecular weight complexes. Two tail-anchored proteins, Tom36 and Tom46, were identified as receptors and bind hydrogenosomal preproteins. A third subunit, Tom22-like protein, lacks a trans domain but has a conserved Tom22 transmembrane segment. The fourth protein, hydrogenosomal outer membrane protein 19 (Homp19), has no known homology. Furthermore, TvTOM is associated with sorting and assembly machinery (Sam50) involved in β-barrel assembly. Visualization of TvTOM by electron microscopy revealed that it forms three pores and has an unconventional skull-like shape. Although TvTOM seems to lack Tom7, phylogenetic profiling predicted Tom7 in free-living excavates. The triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was likely present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LECA), while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
 This study conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 female breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. The researchers analyzed 690,947 SNPs in Stage I, identified 5,365 SNPs for replication in Stage IIa, and further evaluated 22 top SNPs in Stage IV. The top SNP, rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 (TAB2) gene on chromosome 6q25.1, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis. Two other SNPs, rs9383951 and rs7107217, also showed a consistent association in each of the three replication sets. The findings suggest that genetic variants in the TAB2 gene and the ESR1 gene, as well as chromosome 11q24.3, may be related to breast cancer risk. The study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 and suggestsive evidence for two other loci.
 Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are essential for understanding the function of individual proteins, protein complexes, and cellular machinery as a complex system. However, high-throughput techniques for detecting PPIs, such as yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem affinity purification (TAP), produce large amounts of data with significant noise and incompleteness. False positive rates for Y2H and TAP are estimated to be around 64% and 77%, respectively, while false negative rates range from 43% to 71% for Y2H and 15%-50% for TAP.To address the challenge of assessing the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks, a novel technique is presented that utilizes the best fitting network model for PPI networks, geometric graphs. This approach achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. The technique is used to assign confidence scores to physical protein-protein interactions in the human PPI network downloaded from BioGRID, resulting in the prediction of 251 new interactions. The predicted interactions are statistically significant, with a fraction corresponding to protein pairs sharing common GO terms and a significant portion validated in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID.The technique is based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), which regards a larger pairwise weight between nodes as an indication of more dissimilarity. Given pairwise Euclidean distances between all pairs of elements in a set, the goal is to find locations in m-dimensional Euclidean space for these elements so that pairwise distances are preserved. The algorithm successfully embeds 19 PPI networks of various organisms into a low-dimensional space, supporting the hypothesis that PPI networks are geometric.The de-noising approach exploits the fact that high-quality PPI networks are well modeled by geometric graphs. The basic version of the de-noising procedure consists of using two different datasets: one to test the approach and the other to provide a practical application. The human PPI network from BioGRID is used to test the approach, and the largest connected component of this network is taken for analysis. The method successfully predicts new interactions in the human PPI network, with a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. The approach is stable, converging in few iterations and maintaining accuracy during iterations.The technique is compared with existing PPI network post-processing techniques in the final section. Proteins form interactions based on their biochemical properties, which can be considered dimensions of some abstract metric space. PPI networks reside in some biochemical space with a finite number of dimensions. The random geometric graph model matches PPI networks in terms of various global and local network properties, making it a versatile graph family for modeling PPI networks.
 Buruli ulcer (BU), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans), is a progressive skin disease primarily affecting West African communities. The disease is attributed to the production of the cytotoxic macrolide mycolactone, which suppresses local and systemic immune responses and induces apoptosis in various cell types. Despite this, individuals living in endemic regions frequently develop immune responses against M. ulcerans without developing clinical disease. Interferon-γ (IFNγ), a critical regulator of host defense against intracellular pathogens, plays a crucial role in early defense against M. ulcerans infection. In an experimental mouse model, IFNγ knockout mice displayed a faster progression of the infection, with faster tissue necrosis and oedema formation, and a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. These findings suggest that IFNγ-dependent activation of macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria is essential for containing the infection during its early stages. Additionally, histopathological analysis revealed that IFNγ-deficient mice had more extensive tissue necrosis and oedema formation, indicating a stronger immune response against M. ulcerans in wild-type mice. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU, as both diseases involve intracellular bacterial infections and require cell-mediated immunity for effective host defense.
 The mosquito Aedes aegypti, which transmits dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, is a significant target for vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional surveillance methods for Ae. aegypti rely on household inspections for the presence of larvae-bearing containers. However, these methods have limitations, including cost, dependence on agent effort and householder availability, and qualitative measures of abundance. Traps are promising alternatives to larval surveys, as they transfer the searching effort to the mosquitoes and provide both qualitative and quantitative indices.A multicentric entomological survey was conducted in five mid-sized cities in Brazil to compare the entomological indices generated by four types of traps (ovitraps, MosquiTRAP, Adultrap, and BioGent-Sentinel) and the traditional larval survey. Traps were applied monthly to three 1 km2 areas per city, while larval surveys were performed simultaneously. The results showed that all investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring the seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys.The House Index was consistently low in all cities, with a median of 0, indicating that in 50% of months, not a single household was found positive. Traps rarely produced null indices, pointing to their greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of Ae. aegypti in comparison to the larval survey. The Southeast cities, NIG and DQC, presented the highest infestation levels, with similar infestation magnitudes according to OVT and BGS measurements. The traps tended to present lower infestation indices in STR, CGR, and PNM compared to DQC and NIG.Positivity and density indices produced very similar temporal patterns, with mosquito population peaking during the summer months and drastically dropping during the dry winters. Regression models identified a strong positive correlation between mosquito density and minimum or mean air temperature at lags 1 week or 2 weeks. Precipitation also showed correlation with mosquito index, but its significance varied among traps and cities.The study concluded that all investigated traps are valuable tools for dengue endemic countries and could be considered in combination with vector control strategies to improve response to dengue and other diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti. Future studies should assess the cost-benefit of such integrated strategies and evaluate other features before choosing a trap for surveillance, such as specificity, low cost, ease of distribution, and consistent sampling profile.
 Mean-field approximations are commonly used to study large neural networks, but they do not accurately describe the behavior of networks with a small number of neurons. In this case, major differences between the mean-field approximation and the real behavior of the network can arise. However, understanding neural dynamics at the mesoscopic scale, which is intermediate between the macroscopic and microscopic levels, is crucial for unveiling the emergent properties of the brain.In this article, the authors develop a novel systematic analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily small networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. They study the local bifurcations of their neural activity using an approach that is largely analytically tractable and numerically determine the global bifurcations. The authors find that for strong inhibition, these networks give rise to very complex dynamics caused by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations that emerge through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This qualitative change of the neural dynamics is a finite-size effect of the network, revealing previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation.The most important consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reduce the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing. The authors extend the analysis of Beer, who studied the bifurcations of networks of arbitrary size with highly symmetric assumptions on the strength of the synaptic weights, and through asymptotic approximations of the bifurcation manifolds. The authors consider a deterministic finite-size firing-rate network model with excitatory and inhibitory populations composed of an arbitrary number of homogeneous neurons in each population and study the global bifurcations that emerge by varying the external input currents and the strength of inhibition. They find that in the strong-inhibition regime, the network undergoes branching-point bifurcations, from which multiple solutions of the neural equations emerge, enriching the complexity of the bifurcation diagram of the neural network. This dynamics is not revealed by the mean-field approximation.The authors conclude by examining the biological implications of their results and comparing their approach with previous work on homogeneous networks. They observe that the emergence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking in mesoscopic networks is a finite-size effect that reveals previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The authors' approach provides a systematic way to study the dynamics of arbitrarily small networks, which is crucial for understanding neural dynamics at the mesoscopic scale.
 The GPT framework is a computational model for understanding morphogenesis, the process by which complex shapes arise from simple rules in growing tissues. It treats tissue as a continuous material with regional factors under genetic control that can interact and propagate. Polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and is anchored in regions termed tissue polarity organizers. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature. The framework was illustrated through the example of a growing Snapdragon flower and showed how combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes. The GPT framework provides a theoretical foundation for modelling growth and allows hypotheses to be established that can be subjected to further tests. It assumes that regions in a tissue do not slide or move past each other and may be applicable to some aspects of animal development. The framework with its assumption of tissue polarity as a key component of growth specification provides an economical way of generating diverse shapes and forms.
 Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital absence of an eye (anophthalmia) and post-axial oligosyndactyly. A locus for OAS was identified on 14q24.2, and subsequent analysis revealed homozygous, predicted loss-of-function mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight unrelated families. SMOC1 encodes a protein that functions as a BMP antagonist during early embryonic development. The phenotype associated with homozygosity for a targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mouse mutation of Smoc1 also shows significant overlap with the human disease. SMOC-1 and SMOC-2 are the two vertebrate paralogs of the Drosophila protein Pentagone, which has recently been shown to function as an antagonist of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling in vivo. The loss of SMOC-1 function is proposed to cause OAS by altering the BMP gradient within the limb bud and thus altering anteroposterior expansion.
 The Drosophila genes spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr) play crucial roles in the wing imaginal disc by regulating cell survival, proliferation, and vein patterning in the central and lateral regions. To identify Salm and Salr target genes, microarray experiments were conducted comparing the expression profiles of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs. The results revealed a complex transcription landscape, with both positively and negatively regulated genes. Among the identified genes, some require wing growth and patterning, while others have unknown functions. The identification of these target genes provides new insights into the genetic control of wing development by the Dpp pathway.In the wing imaginal disc, salm and salr are expressed in a broad stripe of cells in the wing pouch, which corresponds to the adult wing's vein L2 and extending to the L4/L5 intervein. Their expression is directly regulated by Dpp signalling. To identify Salm/Salr target genes (STG), microarray experiments were performed using the salEPv-Gal4 driver, which reproduces the domain of salm/salr expression in the wing blade region of the imaginal disc. The expression of Salm and Salr was reduced using RNA interference, and the time since the temperature shift from 25°C to 29°C was precisely determined using the temperature-sensitive Gal80 protein.After 24 hours at 29°C, Salm expression was already undetected in the wing blade, while GFP expression was strong in the central domain of the wing. However, discs at 48 hours showed a more severe phenotype, with a loss in FasIII expression and a reduction in the size of the salEPv-Gal4 expression domain. In contrast, control discs showed no difference in expression profiles between 24 and 48 hours at 29°C.The microarray analysis identified 71 genes whose expression changed between discs at T48 and T24, most of which had increased expression at T48. Comparing salm-i/salr-i and control discs at T24 and T48, 686 genes showed significant changes, of which 98 had a fold-change higher than 2. The number of changes was much higher at T48, where 1488 genes were identified, including 168 with a fold-change higher than 2. Most of the genes whose expression level changed at T24 were also detected at T48 hours, with a good correlation between the extent of change observed in the T24 and T48 classes.The lists of genes showed a low overlap with other transcriptomic and genomic analyses carried out in the wing disc. From the total of genes that showed a significant change comparing salm-i/salr-i and control discs at T24 and T48, 124 genes were selected that changed with a logFC of at least 1, and 67 genes were chosen that changed only at T24 or T48. A total of 95 genes were added from experiment 2, which over-expressed sal, along with the best scores. The joint list of STG included 139 genes whose expression increases in salm/salr loss of function (STG+) and 147 whose expression levels decreases in salm/salr loss of function conditions (STG-).The functional significance of the identified genes was investigated using the software DAVID, with the GO term "biological process." For genes whose RNA expression levels change with an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05 at 24 hours after salm/salr RNAi induction, a limited enrichment of GO terms related to the known functions of Sal was found. However, the STG genes with reduced expression in salm/salr knockdown were enriched for the terms "regulation of cell proliferation," "tissue development," "cell morphogenesis," "regulation of signal transduction," and "regulation of biosynthetic process." The STG genes with augmented expression in salm/salr knockdown conditions were only enriched in the descriptions "regulation of gene expression" and "anatomical structure homeostasis."The expression patterns of 100 of the 139 STG+ genes were analyzed in wild type and salm-i/salr-i backgrounds. Most of the analyzed genes displayed a generalized pattern of expression in third instar wing disc or their expression was not detected
 The study reported in this paper investigates how the neural response of the AN2 neuron in crickets adapts to changes in auditory environments, specifically in response to bimodal and trimodal sound stimuli. The infomax and selective coding hypotheses were tested to understand how the neural response curve optimally changes in response to different stimuli. The results showed that adaptation led to a decrease in neural responses to 0 dB peak signals with time, and the response curve shifted to higher stimulus intensities while the slope changed only slightly. The Bayesian parameter estimation revealed that the response curve parameter B50 significantly increased for the trimodal stimulus distribution. However, the increase in slope was not significant. The study also found that adaptation reduced the amount of encoded information about the stimulus when considering the whole range of input signals, which is in contrast to other studies reporting that stimulus encoding is compatible with infomax. The results suggest that instead of improving sensory coding, adaptation in the AN2 decreases information transmission and leaves higher processing centers in the cricket brain with less information, regardless of what part of the stimulus is considered. The adaptation seems to selectively decrease mutual information for low-intensity sounds by shifting the stimulus-response curves towards higher stimulus intensities, reducing spike counts for low-intensity signals. The findings could be the result of a trade-off between setting the operating regime for the bursting mode and suppressing background noise on slower time scales. The study proposes a general paradigm that allows quantifying the improvement in neural coding without requiring that neural response curves achieve optimality, and testing various hypotheses on different stimulus ensembles will yield important insights on what is or what is not the relevant part of a sensory environment for a given sensory unit.
 In this study, the authors investigated the role of RpoS, a master regulator of the general stress response in bacteria, during the tick-phase of Borrelia burgdorferi's enzootic cycle. They demonstrated that RpoS-dependent gene expression is essential for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs. RpoS-deficient organisms were confined to the midgut lumen and transformed into unusual round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal. The round body formation was rapidly reversible, and in vitro, it appeared to be attributable to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, which among other functions, provides NAD+ for glycolysis. The findings suggest that spirochetes default to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation upon sensing that the energetics for transmission are unfavorable. The authors also identified several potential surface adhesins within the RpoS regulon that may function during tick-to-mammal transmission. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of RpoS in the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission and the existence of a proposed default survival mode (round body formation) triggered when spirochetes are unable to produce sufficient energy for dissemination within the nymph.
 Two-cysteine peroxiredoxins (mTXNPx) are essential for the long-term survival of Leishmania infantum amastigotes in the mammalian host, but their peroxidase activity is not required for this function. Instead, mTXNPx may function as a molecular chaperone, as shown by its ability to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro and its role in conferring thermotolerance to L. infantum. The findings challenge the current understanding of the role of peroxiredoxins in trypanosomatids and suggest that these enzymes can have functions beyond peroxide elimination. The study also provides a basis for the development of new strategies to control leishmaniasis using a live attenuated vaccine based on the mtxnpx− parasite line.
 Microbial metabolism of plant polysaccharides is a crucial aspect of environmental carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes based on cellulosic bioconversion. In this study, researchers demonstrated a method to analyze how microbes, specifically the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans, catabolize various plant polysaccharides, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. The researchers applied this method to investigate C. phytofermentans' response to these polysaccharides by up-regulating specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars.The researchers found that C. phytofermentans ferments plant polysaccharides with varying efficiencies and prioritizes metabolism of preferred substrates. Strand-specific RNA-seq revealed that this bacterium responds to polysaccharides by up-regulating specific CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes. Fifty-six up-regulated CAZymes were purified and their activities showed that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with divergent rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. CAZymes were then tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms.The results of this study advance our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, which is essential for understanding carbon flow in the environment, promoting healthy human nutrition and preventing disease, and developing industrial processes based on cellulosic bioconversion. C. phytofermentans was found to ferment a wide range of plant polysaccharides and their constituent monosaccharides, but with varying cell yields and growth rates. The researchers also identified synergies between different CAZymes acting on the same substrate, which could lead to more efficient degradation of plant biomass.
 Glanders, a zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia mallei, is a highly infectious and fatal disease for both animals and humans. Eradicated in many Western countries, glanders has recently resurfaced in Asia, the Middle-East, Africa, and South America. In 2010-'11, Bahrain experienced an outbreak of glanders, with horses and a camel testing positive. To investigate the outbreak, high-resolution genotyping using multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats (MLVA) and comparative whole genome sequencing were applied to B. mallei isolated from infected horses and the positive camel.The results revealed that the samples from the Bahrainian outbreak separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting the involvement of multiple B. mallei strains. Furthermore, the samples from Bahrain were more closely related to B. mallei isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 than other B. mallei, indicating repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations to each other may be indicative of a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified.The recent emergence of glanders and worldwide horse trading pose a new risk for human infections. All animals imported from known or potentially endemic regions should be routinely tested for glanders prior to importation, and repeated testing during quarantine is recommended. The failure of initial eradication efforts in 2010 highlights the need for continued surveillance and abatement measures.
