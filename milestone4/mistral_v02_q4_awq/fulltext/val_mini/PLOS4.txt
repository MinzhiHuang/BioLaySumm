 The genomic GC-content of bacteria varies significantly, ranging from less than 20% to over 70%. This variation is primarily attributed to differences in mutation patterns between species. Through an analysis of synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species, researchers found a large excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations at 4-fold degenerate sites, which is inconsistent with mutation bias. The excess of GC→AT mutations is also observed at 2-fold sites and is strongly correlated with genomic GC-content. These findings suggest that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content and, consequently, genomic base composition in many bacteria.
 The expansion of trinucleotide repeats (TNRs), specifically CAG/CTG repeats, is responsible for various neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD), myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1), and Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). The instability and toxicity of TNRs are tissue-selective, and the mechanisms underlying this selectivity are not well understood. Previous studies suggest that transcription may play a role in TNR instability, but the relationship between transcription and instability in vivo remains unclear.To investigate the relationship between chromatin structure, transcription, and tissue-selective CAG instability, researchers used R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene but have different integration sites, and they exhibit tissue-specific instability. The results showed that instability rates were higher in R6/2 tissues, and this was correlated with increased chromatin accessibility and transcription of the HD transgene.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments and quantitative expression analyses were performed on the striatum and cerebellum of R6/1 and R6/2 mice. The data showed that the HD transgene is integrated in a more euchromatinized and transcriptionally active region in R6/2 mice than in R6/1 mice. However, chromatin accessibility and transcription initiation at the HD locus were similar in the striatum and cerebellum of R6 mice, indicating that tissue-selective CAG instability is unlikely to be simply explained by an accessible or transcriptionally active chromatin state.Interestingly, H3K36 trimethylation and elongating RNA Pol II were increased at the HD locus in the striatum of both R6/1 and R6/2 mice. These results suggest that transcription elongation mediates tissue-specific somatic CAG instability in HD.In conclusion, the data from this study support the view that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability. The findings may have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying tissue-selective instability of other TNRs associated with diseases.
 The study aimed to identify and map Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) research networks in Germany and their partners abroad using bibliometric data. A SCOPUS database search was conducted for articles with German author affiliations published between 2002 and 2012 for 11 kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. The data was analyzed using open-source tools such as OpenRefine, OpenStreetMaps, Table2Net, and Gephi to extract co-authorship networks and visualize research collaborations.The results showed that 1,187 out of 26,833 publications with at least one German author affiliation were identified, and 972 publications were analyzed for the five most published-about diseases. Of these, 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions were extracted. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil. Collaborations with partners on the African continent remained scattered.The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases, and the share of NTD publications with German affiliations was approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. The findings underline the need to identify barriers and expand Germany’s otherwise strong research activities towards NTDs.Geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators and facilitates data-driven health policies.The study's findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions. The analysis revealed that Germany's NTD research output is lower compared to other high-income countries but has a focus on Leishmaniasis, Schistosomiasis, and Chagas disease research. The relatively higher publication output on Sleeping Sickness and Onchocerciasis indicates comparative strength in German NTD research.The research landscape in Germany is spread across different individual universities and publicly funded research entities, and research cooperation with low- and middle-income countries has been the focus of the German government. However, the analysis of German NTD researcher co-authorship patterns revealed that publication output remains dominated by collaborations of researchers from well-known research powerhouses such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Brazil was the most productive collaborating country outside of Germany, with more co-authorships than all other BRICS countries combined.The total number of co-authorships from German research partners in low-income countries was meagre, being only a tenth of the number of those from high-income countries. Analyzing co-authorships between researchers on the African continent and Germany specifically showed that there are only a few very active collaborations. The findings suggest that capacities for research collaborations exist within a range of different countries, even though the overall number of contributions from low-income countries remained comparatively low.The study's findings demonstrate the potential of social network analysis as a tool to apply to the R&D field and provide valuable insights into German research capacities in selected NTDs. The findings showed that 4.4% of all NTD publications worldwide involve an author from a German research institution. The study's findings could contribute to identifying research strengths that can be enhanced and weaknesses to amend through encouraging collaboration in areas of shared expertise. Future research should provide further in-depth analysis of individual researcher and network productivity, scientific impact, and translational success in the development of new products for NTDs.
 Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most important vector-borne disease in Latin America with an estimated 9.8-11 million infected people, 60 million at risk, and a disease burden of over 800,000 DALYs [1-3]. Non-domiciliated triatomine vectors, which do not establish permanent domestic colonies but occasionally infest domestic habitats by immigration from peridomestic and/or sylvatic habitats, are responsible for a significant transmission risk [6-10]. A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses and evaluate the efficacy of various control strategies [16].The model accurately fitted and predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season, resulting in an >80% reduction in bug abundance. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve efficacy and decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention [16]. Alternatively, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate [16].Control of non-domiciliated vectors is challenging since it cannot be achieved solely by insecticide spraying due to the need for yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration [2]. Insect screens offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases [53]. The model's demographic parameters were estimated using two years of field data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, and the predictive value of the model was tested on an independent data set [16].In summary, the model accurately predicted the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated triatomine vectors inside houses and evaluated the efficacy of various control strategies. Pyrethroid spraying was effective when applied at the right time and frequency, but insect screens offered a more sustainable alternative for controlling non-domiciliated vectors. These findings have implications for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases and highlight the importance of mathematical modeling in informing public health policies.
 This study investigates how people's tastes for preferences, specifically in the context of temporal discounting, can be influenced by observing others' choices. The researchers hypothesized that people are uncertain about their own preferences and that this uncertainty can lead to preference shifts when exposed to social information. The study involved a large community sample of 14-24-year-olds who completed a temporal discounting task.The results showed that participants displayed decision variability, which was better accounted for by a random-taste than a response-noise model. The apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model that took into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. The findings have significant implications for neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental research.The study found that participants' choices were influenced by the choices of a simulated other, and that this effect was more pronounced when the other's choices were more different from their own. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the uncertainty-relevance model, which predicts that people are more likely to shift towards the preferences of others when they are uncertain about their own preferences.The study also found that the degree of preference-shifting was related to the variance in the data, as expected from the model. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that people are more likely to update their beliefs when they are uncertain and when the new information is relevant.The study has important implications for understanding how social influences can shape our preferences and beliefs. It suggests that people are not fixed in their preferences and that social information can play a significant role in shaping our uncertain beliefs. The findings may also have implications for understanding the development of preferences over time and for clinical interventions aimed at changing preferences in areas such as addiction and mental health.
 Rice is a monocotyledonous crop with fibrous root systems, and its root growth is influenced by ethylene and auxin. Ethylene inhibits root elongation through auxin biosynthesis, and YUC8/REIN7, a member of the YUC gene family, is involved in this process. YUC8/REIN7 catalyzes the conversion of IPA to IAA, a rate-limiting step in the IPA pathway, and its expression is induced by ethylene through OsEIL1. The findings suggest that ethylene stimulates auxin biosynthesis in roots through the ethylene signaling component OsEIL1, and YUC8/REIN7 is one of the factors that modulate auxin biosynthesis. The regulation of YUC8/REIN7 is directly activated by OsEIL1, leading to an increase in auxin accumulation, which in turn decreases root elongation. The YUC8/REIN7-mediated pathway is partially required by OsEIL1 signaling for the regulation of the ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Additionally, ethylene-inhibited root growth requires YUC8/REIN7-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Ethylene and auxin interact in rice root elongation, and further investigations are needed to elucidate their relationship in the control of rice roots.
 The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is upregulated in cancer tissues and is involved in regulating cellular proliferation. Its expression is cell cycle-regulated, with high levels during G1/S and mitosis. Depletion of MALAT1 in human diploid cells results in G1-to-S transition and mitotic progression defects, as evidenced by downregulation of genes involved in G1/S and mitotic progression. MALAT1 is proposed to act as a "molecular sponge" to titrate the cellular pool of SR splicing factors, creating a gradient of functionally competent splicing factors and controlling alternative splicing. MALAT1 also influences the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of oncogenic transcription factors, especially those that control mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 in specific cell lines, such as HDFs, results in p53 activation and cell cycle arrest, while in other cell lines, such as HeLa and U2OS, it results in mitotic defects. The mechanism by which MALAT1 influences p53 signaling pathway is not yet clear.MALAT1 interacts with several pre-mRNA splicing factors, including SR splicing factors, and influences alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs by regulating the distribution and activity of SR splicing factors. Its depletion in post-G1/S stage of the cell cycle results in defects in the expression of a large number of genes involved in mitotic progression. Specifically, CENPE and B-MYB display defects in alternative splicing and reduced expression in MALAT1-depleted cells. CENPE is a kinesin-like motor protein that plays a crucial role in chromosome segregation and spindle elongation, while B-MYB is a transcription factor with known cell cycle control functions and is highly overexpressed in several cancers. The reduction in B-MYB and its mitotic targets in MALAT1-depleted cells is the major effector leading to aberrant mitotic gene expression.B-MYB binds to the MALAT1 promoter and could potentially regulate MALAT1 expression, indicating that MALAT1 and B-MYB could be part of a positive regulatory loop. MALAT1-depleted cells also show changes in alternative splicing of B-MYB and CENPE transcripts and increased binding of SRSF1 to the exons of these transcripts. The dynamic changes in MALAT1 levels during the cell cycle titrate the intracellular pool of SR proteins and its association with pre-mRNAs, which in turn influence alternative splicing, stability, and expression of specific mRNAs, including B-MYB and CENPE.In summary, MALAT1 is a crucial player in mitotic progression that is independent of its involvement in G1/S progression. Its depletion results in defects in the expression of a large number of genes involved in mitotic progression, specifically CENPE and B-MYB. The reduction in B-MYB and its mitotic targets in MALAT1-depleted cells is the major effector leading to aberrant mitotic gene expression. MALAT1 and B-MYB could be part of a positive regulatory loop, and the dynamic changes in MALAT1 levels during the cell cycle influence alternative splicing, stability, and expression of specific mRNAs.
 This study investigates the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in HIV-1 transmission through an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue. IL-7 is a cytokine present in semen and plays a crucial role in T cell development and homeostasis. The study found that IL-7 significantly enhances HIV-1 replication in cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissue, promoting the proliferation and preventing apoptosis of infected CD4+ T cells and new potential target cells for HIV-1. The results suggest that the increase in the number and prolongation of the lifespan of HIV-1-infected cells, along with uninfected cells, will result in expanding the founder pool of infected cells, thus enhancing the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. The concentration of IL-7 in semen of HIV-1-infected men may be a key determinant of the efficiency of HIV-1 transmission to uninfected partners through vaginal intercourse. The study used tonsillar and cervico-vaginal tissue blocks, which were cultured for 6, 9, or 12 days in the presence or absence of 5 or 25 ng/mL of recombinant human IL-7. The results showed that IL-7 enhanced HIV-1 replication in both cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissue, as evidenced by an increase in HIV-1 p24gag antigen in the medium of tissue cultures and an increase in the percentage of CD8− p24gag+ T cells. The study also found that IL-7 decreases apoptosis in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, as shown by a decrease in the percentage of APO2+ T cells, and increases the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The study used tonsillar and cervico-vaginal tissue blocks, which were cultured for 6, 9, or 12 days in the presence or absence of 5 or 25 ng/mL of recombinant human IL-7. The results showed that IL-7 enhanced HIV-1 replication in both cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissue, as evidenced by an increase in HIV-1 p24gag antigen in the medium of tissue cultures and an increase in the percentage of CD8− p24gag+ T cells. The study also found that IL-7 decreases apoptosis in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, as shown by a decrease in the percentage of APO2+ T cells, and increases the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The study used tonsillar and cervico-vaginal tissue blocks, which were cultured for 6, 9, or 12 days in the presence or absence of 5 or 25 ng/mL of recombinant human IL-7.

 This study explores the origins of genetic robustness in metabolic networks across hundreds of bacterial species and various simulated growth environments. The authors provide evidence that variations in species' metabolic robustness reflect ecological adaptations, decoupling robustness into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent. The environmental-dependent component is responsible for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle, while the environmental-independent component is linked to a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities, such as fast growth or extensive secondary metabolite production. The study also identifies reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets. The authors conduct a large-scale computational study using metabolic data from KEGG and topology-driven approaches to predict an organism's viability in a given environment based on its ability to produce essential biomass metabolites. They find that environmental robustness significantly correlates with two established measures of species' habitat variability and metabolic network modularity. By integrating the expansion algorithm and the seed algorithm, they provide a new model that predicts robustness across species, environments, and condition-dependent and independent reactions. The findings suggest that genetic robustness is associated with environmental robustness and that both evolve as a result of adaptations to different ecological niches and lifestyles.
 This study investigates the role of the Elongator complex, specifically its catalytic subunit Elp3, in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability in budding yeast. Elp3 is a histone acetyltransferase that interacts with the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and is required for efficient telomeric gene silencing and resistance to DNA damaging agents.Cells lacking Elp3 exhibit defects in transcriptional silencing and are sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The silencing defects and HU sensitivity of Elp3 mutant cells are due to compromised formation of the Elongator complex, as shown by the inability to purify all six subunits of the complex from cells expressing certain mutant alleles.Elp3 interacts genetically and biochemically with factors involved in nucleosome assembly pathways and DNA replication and repair. Elp3 forms a complex with PCNA, and mutations in Elp3 that affect the structural integrity of the Elongator complex also reduce telomeric gene silencing and HU resistance.The Elongator complex can be subdivided into two subcomplexes: Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3, and Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6. Elp1 binds to the Elp4–Elp6 subcomplex through its interaction with Elp3, but Elp2 did not co-purify with Elp1, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 in cells lacking Elp3. Elp2 interacted with Elp3 and that this interaction was important for Elp2 to be incorporated into an intact Elongator complex. Moreover, Elp2 did not co-purify with Elp5 from cells expressing the three elp3 site-specific mutants that contain mutations at the Radical SAM domain.Elp3 is needed for efficient progression through S phase under normal growth conditions and is essential when HU-induced replication stress occurs. Elp3 interacts with several components, including Asf1, Rtt109, H3K56Ac, and H4K5, 12, that are known to be involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. The Elongator complex interacts directly with PCNA in vivo and in vitro, and the interaction is not mediated through CAF-1.In summary, this study reveals a new function for Elp3 in maintaining genome stability and suggests that Elp3 functions in this process through a pathway genetically and physically linked to PCNA. The findings provide insights into the role of the Elongator complex in regulating DNA replication- or DNA repair-coupled nucleosome assembly and maintaining genome stability.
 Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases, and the inoculum dose, or the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used, plays an important role in vaccine design. Higher inoculum doses generally lead to better immune responses but may cause more severe side effects and reduce population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal inoculum dose is crucial for rational vaccine design.In this study, researchers used data and mathematical models to investigate the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity for influenza A virus (IAV) and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infections. They analyzed data from previously published studies on mice and cotton rats infected with different inoculum doses of IAV and HPIV, respectively. They also used data on the relationship between the innate immune response and morbidity from a human influenza infection study.The researchers developed a mechanistic, dynamical model of the infection dynamics based on ordinary differential equations to track target cells, virus, and immune response components. They used the model to fit the data for both IAV and HPIV, estimating the starting value for the virus inoculum and shared model parameters across different inoculum doses. They assessed model performance by the sum of squared residuals and normalized the contributions of each variable to allow for comparison.The findings showed that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen. For both IAV and HPIV, higher inoculum doses generally led to stronger immune responses, but for HPIV, the innate response was triggered so strongly that it led to quick pathogen clearance and reduced adaptive immune response activation, resulting in reduced immune protection. The researchers noted that this pattern may not apply to real settings and that further studies are needed to validate the model.The study demonstrated that using a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal inoculum dose for any pathogen. The researchers suggested that data collection for correlates of immune protection and direct or indirect markers of morbidity for a few different inoculum doses, as well as further measurements to validate models, would be essential for testing and calibrating models to produce predictions for protection and morbidity over a full range of inoculum doses. This information could help in vaccine design, particularly in cases where only limited antigen is available.
 This study investigates the role of Dnmt3a, a DNA methyltransferase, in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer using a mouse model of lung cancer. Dnmt3a deficiency results in loss of methylation in large active chromatin domains. The study found that Dnmt3a deficiency leads to a significant increase in tumor size, higher histological grade, and papillary growth pattern. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to comprehensively characterize DNA methylation patterns in this model system. The results showed that Dnmt3a deficiency results in a loss of methylation in large active chromatin domains, which is important for maintaining normal methylation levels for a subset of genomic CpG dinucleotides. The study also found that repetitive elements, such as Line1, SineB1, and satellite repeat elements, showed similar methylation changes as those observed in the global analysis of CpG dinucleotides, further supporting the notion that Dnmt3a is required for effective maintenance methylation in a subset of sequences. The study also found that Dnmt3a deficiency affects gene expression, with 462 genes identified that showed a more than 2-fold difference in steady-state transcript abundance between Dnmt3awt and Dnmt3aKO tumors. The findings establish a close association between Dnmt3a-dependent DNA methylation and gene regulation. The study was carried out in accordance with the United States Health Research Extension Act and approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Committee on Animal Care.
 This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration in individuals of African ancestry using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in four cohorts. The results revealed a genome-wide significant association with the SNP rs3922844 in SCN5A, which explains approximately 2% of variability in PR interval duration. This association was not correlated with another SNP in SCN5A previously reported in European ancestry and had a larger effect estimate. The study also observed genome-wide significant association signals of SNPs in SCN10A, TBX5, and MEIS1, which are correlated with SNPs reported in previous GWAS in individuals of European ancestry. The findings suggest that common variants are likely to be relevant to individuals of African ancestry, but large-scale resequencing and functional experiments are necessary to identify the causal variants specific to each population. The study used a stringent significance threshold of 2.5×10−8 to account for the approximately two million common variant tests estimated to exist across the genome and applied methods to address population stratification and confounding by ancestry. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at all participating institutions and included individuals of self-reported African American ancestry from four cohort studies. PR interval duration was measured electronically using standard algorithms, and all genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0.
 Inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in various brain systems. Two common inhibitory network motifs are feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition. In the locust olfactory system, both motifs can maintain sparse responses in Kenyon cells (KCs) and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition can create a phase response consistent with in vivo data.In the locust, a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), is the primary source of inhibition in the mushroom body (MB), and its inhibition is mediated by a feedback loop involving KCs and the GGN. While FF and FB inhibition can limit the firing of postsynaptic neurons, some specific properties differ between the two motifs. FF inhibition is controlled by upstream excitatory neurons, allowing for complete blocking of action potentials and creating relatively fast inhibition, which is suitable for precise temporal processing. FB inhibition, on the other hand, is well-suited to synchronize firing in populations of excitatory principal neurons.Sparse stimulus representations can arise through either FF or FB inhibitory motifs. Both motifs co-exist in the honeybee and mammal MB, with FF inhibition producing transient early-onset inhibition in the cortex and FB inhibition producing late-onset inhibition in the olfactory cortex. In the vertebrate olfactory pathway, FF inhibition in the cortex and FB inhibition in the olfactory cortex have distinct properties.Recent evidence suggests that the influence of GGN is consistent with the disparity in activity seen between the MB and lateral horn (LH). In the FB model, excitatory input from KCs drives GGN, which in turn sends inhibition back to KCs. In the FF model, PNs from the antennal lobe (AL) drive GGN, which then inhibits the KCs. While the FB model is supported by recent anatomical evidence from the locust, both FB and FF mechanisms may exist in insect olfactory systems.Both FF and FB models show oscillatory behavior, as the pacemaker for the whole circuit resides in the AL and consists of interactions between PNs and LNs. GGN responds to odors with non-spiking but oscillatory synchronized responses, as shown empirically. GGN provides inhibitory input to both KCs and LHNs and is the focal point for both inhibitory motifs.In both models, GGN increases its activity as odor concentration increases. At low odor concentrations, the FF model produces a more responsive GGN, while the FB model produces a more active GGN at high odor concentrations. Overall, the FB model generates responses that span a broader range of responses compared to the FF model.Despite significant differences in synaptic inhibition for each specific concentration, there is not a significant difference between FF and FB models across the entire range of odor concentrations. However, the inhibitory input from GGN follows a different profile in the two models, with main differences emerging at very low concentrations where the FF model delivers significantly stronger inhibition than the FB model.Inhibition from GGN regulates action potentials produced by KCs, decreasing the number of overall action potentials and the number of cells responding to the odor. Population sparseness is much greater when inhibition is included in the models, and responsive KCs typically fire a single action potential. Both FF and FB models limit the number of action potentials elicited by all concentrations of odor presentations but allow for different increases in the total number of action potentials as odor concentration increases.In summary, both FF and FB inhibitory motifs can maintain the MB to respond sparsely to odors, fulfilling a requirement for efficient formatting for memory storage. However, they exhibit distinct properties, such as the timing and extent of inhibition, which can impact downstream processing and communication between neurons. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these differences and how they contribute to the overall function of the olfactory system.
 The BRCA Challenge is an initiative within the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) aimed at aggregating BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support collaborative research on the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk. The project, which includes the BRCA Exchange website, has amassed over 20,000 unique BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, with approximately 3,700 of those variants having expert classifications from the ENIGMA Consortium. The data is drawn from various sources, including ClinVar, BIC, ExAC, 1000 Genomes, and the ENIGMA consortium, and is publicly accessible through the BRCA Exchange website. The goal is to reduce uncertainty in variant interpretation and improve clinical decision-making by enabling easy access to expert-curated variant classifications and supporting evidence. However, challenges include the willingness of data holders to share, the need to ensure data quality, and the aggregation of individual-level data. Ongoing work includes engagement with patient and advocacy groups, the development of tools to make the database meaningful and useful to patients and advocates, and the integration of new data and further annotation of variants of uncertain clinical significance.
 The RAS/MAPK pathway is a crucial signaling cascade that transmits cellular responses to various developmental and oncogenic stimuli. RAS, a small GTPase, activates the RAF-MEK-MAPK module, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified several factors regulating RAS/MAPK signaling, primarily focusing on RAF activation. However, the regulatory network surrounding the core MAPK module remains incompletely understood.To gain a comprehensive view of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling, a genome-wide RNAi screen was conducted in Drosophila S2 cells. The screen identified 101 validated hits, most of which were previously known factors associated with the pathway. Epistasis experiments revealed that most hits unexpectedly worked downstream of MEK and specifically influenced MAPK expression. These hits mainly consisted of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels.Two representative members of this group, mago and eIF4AIII, were further characterized and found to regulate mapk splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Additionally, it indicates that core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing.
 Recent studies have developed methods to reconstruct transmission trees of infectious disease outbreaks using densely sampled whole genome sequence (WGS) data. However, a fundamental limitation of these approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. This means that the position of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between the sampled pathogens. The concept of 'transmission divergence' is introduced to quantify and compare the useful genetic diversity expected from genetic data in different pathogen outbreaks. Transmission divergence is defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs.Through simulation studies using two models, the outbreaker model and the phybreak model, the transmission divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens was estimated. The results showed that transmission divergence was generally low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. Rapidly evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses had higher transmission divergence than bacterial pathogens, but even they had limited genetic diversity between transmission pairs. The impact of transmission divergence on the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using the R packages outbreaker and phybreak was demonstrated. Genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens provided valuable information on individual transmission events, while sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence provided little to no information.The findings highlight the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios and demonstrate the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data. The results also suggest that the analysis of WGS alone will struggle to reconstruct transmission trees accurately for a large number of pathogens, particularly bacterial ones. Integrating other types of outbreak data, such as locations of patients, community structure, or contact tracing data, represents a promising alternative strategy for outbreak reconstruction.
 This study aimed to identify immune profiles associated with the clinical outcome of subsequent DENV infection by analyzing cytokine production in response to DENV stimulation using PBMC collected prior to infection. The analysis revealed that stimulation of PBMC with all four types of DENV induced the production of cytokines, nine of which significantly differed according to the clinical outcome of DENV infection. Six cytokines/chemokines were more highly produced in PBMC of subjects who had subclinical infections, and three cytokines/chemokines were elevated in PBMC of subjects with symptomatic infections. Notable findings included higher production of IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα in PBMC of subjects with subclinical infections, while IL-6, IL-15, and MCP-1 were more highly produced in PBMC of subjects with symptomatic infections. These findings suggest that profiles of "protective" or "pathologic" cytokines might contribute to an individual having a subsequent subclinical or clinically apparent secondary DENV infection. However, limitations of the study include measuring cytokine levels at a single time point post-stimulation, using a single representative virus strain for each DENV type, and not identifying the cell types responsible for cytokine production. Future studies will attempt to address these limitations and clarify the immunological pathways responsible for the observed differences in cytokine production.
