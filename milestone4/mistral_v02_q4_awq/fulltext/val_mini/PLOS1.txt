 Arabidopsis thaliana's cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) interacts with bHLH transcription factors, specifically CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5, to mediate light control of flowering time. CRY2 interacts with these bHLH proteins in response to blue light, but not in darkness or other wavelengths. CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 act redundantly to activate the transcription of FT and are positive regulators of CRY2-mediated flowering. CRY2 and CIB1/2/4/5 form heterodimers with higher binding affinity to the non-canonical E-box in the in vitro DNA-binding assays, explaining why they bind to the canonical E-box in vitro but non-canonical E-boxes in vivo. The expression of CIBs is regulated specifically by blue light. Overexpression of CIBs results in early flowering, while their dominant repressor versions cause a delayed flowering phenotype. CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 promote flowering redundantly by activating FT mRNA expression and interact with CRY2 to regulate gene transcription. They also form heterodimers to regulate cell elongation. CIBs are degraded in the absence of blue light via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway, but their degradation is suppressed in blue light, resulting in the accumulation of CIBs.
 Enteric bacterial pathogens, including Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), cause foodborne diseases that result in significant economic and health burdens. EHEC is known to cause hemorrhagic colitis and pediatric renal failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome; HUS) through transmission via contaminated food, water, or contact with animals. EHEC utilizes a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells, disrupting the normal function of intestinal epithelial cells.The T3SS effectors NleH1 and NleH2 of EHEC bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of NF-κB transcriptional complexes. NleH1 and NleH2 co-localize with RPS3 in the cytoplasm but not in cell nuclei, and their N-terminal regions are required for binding to the N-terminus of RPS3. Both NleH1 and NleH2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr protein kinases, but their binding to RPS3 is independent of kinase activity.NleH1 reduces the nuclear abundance of RPS3 without altering the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits or affecting the phosphorylation state or abundance of the inhibitory NF-κB chaperone IκBα. NleH1 represses the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, but does not inhibit the transcription of RPS3-independent reporters. In contrast, NleH2 stimulates RPS3-dependent transcription and an AP-1-dependent reporter. A region of NleH1 (N40-K45) is at least partially responsible for the inhibitory activity of NleH1 toward RPS3.Deleting nleH1 from E. coli O157:H7 produced a hypervirulent phenotype in a gnotobiotic piglet model of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection. These findings suggest that NleH may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes.
 This study aimed to identify selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in two high-altitude human populations, Andeans and Tibetans, using high-density multilocus SNP genotype data. The analysis involved the use of four tests of natural selection: locus-specific branch length (LSBL), the log of the ratio of heterozygosities (lnRH), the standardized difference of D, and whole genome long range haplotype (WGLRH) tests. The results showed that several chromosomal regions exhibit evidence of positive directional selection, which are unique to either Andeans or Tibetans, suggesting a lack of evolutionary convergence between these two highland populations. However, convergent evolution between Andeans and Tibetans is suggested based on the signal detected for the HIF regulatory gene EGLN1. In addition to EGLN1, a second HIF regulatory gene, EPAS1, as well as two HIF targeted genes, PRKAA1 and NOS2A, have been identified as selection-nominated candidate genes in Tibetans (EPAS1) or Andeans (PRKAA1, NOS2A). PRKAA1 and NOS2A play major roles in physiological processes essential to human reproductive success. The findings of this study have the potential for elucidating key pathways responsible for major causes of human morbidity and mortality, and it will be important to confirm the results with genotype-phenotype association studies that link genotype to a specific high-altitude phenotype. The study also included the analysis of common copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) and rare copy number variants (CNVs) to identify patterns of genetic variation associated with directional selection in highlanders compared to lowlanders. The data was generated using the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 by Affymetrix Inc. and analyzed separately for Andeans and Tibetans, with the results compared. The study involved the use of two high-altitude human populations, Andeans and Tibetans, as well as closely related low-altitude control populations. All assayed samples were included in the SNP analysis, but for the CNV analysis, 16 samples were removed that did not pass the quality control filters. The EIGENSOFT package was used for principal component analysis, and admixture estimates were performed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in frappe. Related individuals were removed based on IBD PI_HAT values, and inter-population biases in missing data were avoided by defining a threshold of at least three genotypes called per population sample and cleaning the merged dataset of SNPs with global minor allele frequency <1%. The Mesoamerican sample and the East Asian sample were used as low-altitude control populations for the Andeans, while the European and East Asian samples were used as low-altitude control populations for the Tibetan population. Candidate positive selection loci were identified in Andean and Tibetan populations by applying four tests of natural selection: LSBL, lnRH, the standardized difference of D, and WGLRH tests. LSBL, lnRH, and the standardized difference of D were computed using Perl scripts written specifically for this data set, while the WGLRH test was computed using the algorithm developed by Zhang et al. Significance was assessed by comparing the relative extended haplotype homozygosity (REHH) of a specific core haplotype to the gamma distribution and applying the false discovery rate approach to correct for multiple tests. The study identified several statistically significant loci in Andeans and Tibetans, which are unique to each population and suggest a lack of evolutionary convergence. However, the study also identified convergent evolution between Andeans and Tibetans based on the signal detected for the HIF regulatory gene EGLN1. The study identified several key HIF regulatory and targeted genes as responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions were implicated in the putative response to selection. The findings of this study provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.
 Machupo virus (MACV) and Junin virus (JUNV), two New World arenaviruses in the Arenaviridae family, cause Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF) and Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), respectively. Previously, we reported that a recombinant, chimeric MACV (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) expressing the glycoprotein (GPC) from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of JUNV is attenuated and protects animals from lethal challenge with MACV. To investigate the role of different domains of Cd#1 GPC in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1-GPC, we rescued several rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of GPC from Cd#1 either alone (MCg1), along with the TMD F438I substitution (MCg2), or with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg3). All rMACVs exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells, but MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality as compared with rMACV in mice. MCg1 was detected in brains and spleens of MCg1-infected mice and was associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, all animals survived MCg2 and MCg3 infection without detectable levels of virus in various organs while producing neutralizing antibody against Cd#1. Overall, our data suggest the indispensable role of each GPC domain in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1-GPC.
 This study evaluates the performance of a new commercial dengue NS1 detection test, the Dengue Early Rapid, used alone and in combination with the Dengue Duo Cassette in retrospective studies at two Southeast Asian sites. The Dengue Early Rapid was developed using an equimolar combination of Ab2 and Ab1 MAbs immobilized onto nitrocellulose membrane and the cross-reactive Ab3 MAb conjugated to colloidal gold particles for detection of captured NS1. The test was found to have a sensitivity of 69.2% (95% CI: 62.8-75.6) and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 92.2-99.8) when compared to laboratory-confirmed dengue cases defined by the detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR or seroconversion in the IgM or IgG antigen-capture ELISA. The sensitivity was higher for samples positive by RT-PCR (71.1% vs. 61.5%) but lower for samples that demonstrated seroconversion with no viral RNA detected (61.5% vs. 46.2%). The combination of NS1 detection with anti-IgM detection resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to 89.0% (95% CI: 85.2-92.8) compared to detection of NS1 alone. The sensitivity was further improved to 93.0% by combining all three dengue markers (NS1, anti-IgM, and anti-IgG). The sensitivity of the antigen rapid test for each serotype was 78% for DENV-1, 62.5% for DENV-2, 61.3% for DENV-3, and 33.3% for DENV-4. The Dengue Early Rapid had a lower sensitivity than an NS1 capture ELISA but showed equivalent specificity. The study highlights the importance of combining NS1 detection with antibody detection for optimal diagnostic sensitivity for acute dengue.
 Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial for initiating and propagating the eukaryotic innate immune signaling cascade. This study investigates TirS, a Staphylococcus aureus TIR mimic that inhibits TLR signaling and downregulates the NF-κB pathway through inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9. The tirS gene is invariably located within the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance but not always carrying the mecA gene. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid increase tirS expression, and epidemiological studies show a selective advantage with a SCCmec element carrying SCC fusC/tirS. These findings suggest that TirS production may confer a selective advantage for S. aureus by evading the host immune system. TirS is a potent inhibitor of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, all of which depend on MyD88, a general adaptor protein in Toll/IL-1 receptor family signaling. In vitro results show that S. aureus carrying tirS induced no increased virulence in MyD88 knockout mice, suggesting that TirS interacts with MyD88. Overall, these results suggest that TirS modulates an inflammatory response at the site of infection through the MyD88 adaptor protein.
 Protein N-terminal acetylation is a common and irreversible modification that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. It occurs co-translationally during protein synthesis, and the N-terminus defines the acetylation status of a protein. The enzymes involved in this process are conserved in pro- and eukaryotes, but the biological functions of N-terminal acetylation are not well understood. In this study, researchers analyzed the amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells to identify common principles of N-terminal acetylation. They detected over 1,200 mature protein N-termini and showed that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. They also identified a rule, referred to as the (X) PX rule, that indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylation. The researchers applied this assay by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and in flies. The (X) PX rule seems to be conserved among organisms, suggesting that it can be used to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species.
 Exosomes are membrane-enclosed vesicles that play crucial roles in viral life cycles by mediating intercellular communication and immune responses. During viral infections, exosomes can transfer viral particles, genomes, and host genetic elements to neighboring cells, helping to establish productive infections and modulating host immune response. For instance, Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection results in upregulated exosome secretion and selective packaging of high-level miR-146a, which can be functionally transferred to and facilitate exosomal EV71 RNA to replicate in the recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response. The findings also suggest that EV71-induced exosomal miR-146a may partly affect the production of exosomes in recipient cells due to inhibition of type I interferons production. Additionally, EV71 infection upregulates the expression of BST-2/tetherin, which is involved in regulating EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. In vivo studies showed that exosome-containing viral RNA exhibited differential tissue accumulation compared to free virus particles. Overall, these findings provide evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high-level miR-146a that can be functionally transferred to and facilitate exosomal EV71 RNA to replicate in the recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.
 Recent experimental evidence suggests that chromatin loops, characterized by connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form, play a significant role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. To systematically understand how changes in these factors impact variability at the expression level, a modeling effect is needed. In this study, we develop a mechanistic model based on a 4–state model of stochastic transcription, which maps three fundamental patterns of two interacting DNA loops into this model.Our analysis reveals that in contrast to side-by-side loops, nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, while alternating loops have the opposite effect. We also compare the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression and find that the former performs better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise, but this control or tuning is distance-dependent and remarkable for moderate loop lengths. There is a limit loop length such that the difference in effect between two communication forms almost disappears. Our results support the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis.Regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, are essential for gene expression and can be divided into two families based on their proximity to the transcription start site. Complexity in gene expression arises from the ordered interactions among regulatory elements, leading to stochastic gene transcription and cell-to-cell variability. Enhancers, which can be several hundred kilobases away from the promoter they regulate, activate promoters by directly contacting binding sites for transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes via DNA looping. The exact composition of core promoter elements may be a key determinant of enhancer-promoter specificity.When various possible regulatory elements and the distances among them are considered, how the corresponding communication mechanisms affect gene expression remains poorly understood and requires further studies. Additionally, the nature of chromatin loop formation and its involvement in gene regulation is not fully understood, and relevant experimental tests are required to verify the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis.
 This paper focuses on the dynamic behavior of gene transcription networks, specifically addressing the issue of context-dependent behavior caused by retroactivity. Retroactivity is a phenomenon similar to loading that influences the performance of modules upon connection to other modules. The authors establish an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity, using three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity. These matrices quantify the effect of intramodular and intermodular connections on a module's dynamics.The internal retroactivity matrix describes how intramodular connections affect an isolated module's dynamics, while scaling and mixing retroactivity matrices establish how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules. By using these matrices and the dynamics of modules in isolation, the authors can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules.The implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity are illustrated on various recurrent network motifs, such as negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. The authors also provide a quantitative metric to determine the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be employed to evaluate the extent of modularity in natural networks and to establish design guidelines for minimizing retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.The authors begin by introducing a standard mechanistic model for gene transcription networks, which includes protein production, decay, and reversible binding reactions between transcription factors (TFs) and promoter sites. They then identify a transcriptional component with a node, and a transcription network as a set of interconnected nodes, where a node represents the transcriptional component producing a TF. The dynamics of a module are represented by equation (1), which can be partitioned into production/decay and binding/unbinding reactions.The authors then discuss retroactivity, which significantly alters the dynamic behavior of modules after interconnection. They provide a model for a single module without inputs and describe how retroactivity among nodes affects the module's dynamics. The authors obtain the first main result of the paper, which approximates the dynamics of a module in the isolated module with equations (5) and (6), where represents external perturbations to the module. The internal retroactivity of a module is described by equation (6), which quantifies how retroactivity among the nodes internal to the module affects the isolated module dynamics.The authors next consider the case when a module is inserted into its context and obtain equation (12), which describes the dynamics of a module connected to its context. They define the scaling and mixing retroactivity of the context, which account for the loading that the context applies on the module and the "mixing" of the dynamics of the module and its context, respectively. The authors illustrate the effects of retroactivity on the module's dynamics using a simple example and provide a metric for quantifying the difference between the isolated and connected module behavior.The authors conclude by discussing the implications of their findings for the analysis and design of gene regulatory networks and the potential applications in synthetic biology. They also mention some limitations of their framework, such as the lack of consideration of post-translational protein modifications and the dynamics of shared resources.
 The present work aims to develop a methodology for estimating the in vivo cell killing ability of chemotherapy using a mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment. The model takes into account cell repopulation between drug administrations and summarizes cancer biology through primary mechanisms such as uncontrolled cell proliferation, reversible dormancy, clonal heterogeneity, hypoxia, and attenuated apoptosis. The methodology is applied to NSCLC, specifically to cisplatin-based doublet regimens, and considers two types of tumor cell growth corresponding to the ADC and SCC histological subtypes. A comprehensive literature survey guides the selection of appropriate values for characteristic proliferation kinetics for the two subtypes. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the fraction of stem cells that perform symmetric divisions and the fraction of newborn cells that withdraw from the active cycle to a dormant phase have the most significant influence on the estimation of drug efficacy. The global sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the rate that a tumor grows in the absence of treatment (Td) and the GF at diagnosis are the most important determinants of the accuracy of CKR estimates. The model's robustness to the kinetics of apoptosis, necrosis, and stem cell resistance is also investigated. The methodology is applied to 13 real clinical cases of NSCLC, and the results demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed cancer model/methodology for personalized predictions of treatment response at diagnosis. Additionally, the study suggests that correlation studies between in vivo CKR estimates and the molecular profile of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
 The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a genetic neurological disorder characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, spastic paraplegia, lack of speech, and severe cognitive deficiency. AHDS is caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, which is an X-linked gene. MCT8 is a thyroid hormone (TH) transporter, and AHDS patients exhibit endocrine alterations in their TH parameters, with decreased plasma concentration of the prohormone T4 and increased concentration of the active form T3. TH is essential for development, neurogenesis, growth, and metabolism, and its uptake into cells requires efficient transport across the cell membrane because T3 regulates gene transcription by binding to nuclear TH receptors (TRs). The underlying mechanism of AHDS is thought to involve a defect in the MCT8-dependent neuronal entry of T3, leading to impaired neurological development. However, the location of altered neuronal circuits and the nature of deficiencies remain elusive, and adequate treatment is not available.To elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHDS, researchers have generated animal models, including MCT8 knockout (KO) mice and zebrafish. MCT8 KO mice replicate the endocrine and metabolic abnormalities found in human patients but do not display any neurological or behavioral phenotypes. This is likely due to the pronounced expression of the anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1), a specific T4 transporter, at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice but not in humans. Therefore, development of an alternative animal model that lacks MCT8 and demonstrates AHDS-like neurological phenotypes is essential.The zebrafish is an ideal model for studying AHDS due to its transparency, which allows the visualization of neural circuit dynamics in live animals, and its conserved hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and emerging use in therapeutic drug screening. Researchers have recently isolated the zebrafish mct8 gene and promoter and shown that, as in humans, zebrafish MCT8 mediates TH uptake in cell lines. Knock-down of MCT8 in zebrafish larvae resulted in neurological abnormalities.In a recent study, researchers used the zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) genome editing system to establish an MCT8 mutant (mct8−/−) zebrafish model. Using gene quantification and localization assays, as well as time-lapse imaging of single neuronal circuits and synapses in live animals and video-tracking of behavior, they found altered expression of myelin-related genes, circuit-specific deficiencies in axon branching and synaptic density, and altered locomotor activity and sleep in mct8−/− larvae. Comparative pharmacological assays demonstrated that TH analogs can restore a portion of the neurological phenotypes. These findings suggest a neurological mechanism and treatment for AHDS and potentially other related psychomotor retardation disorders.Deficiency in mobility and voluntary movements is a hallmark of AHDS, and includes the inability to sit, stand, or walk independently, as well as slow psychomotor reaction to sensory input. These symptoms, together with the myelin-related phenotype found in zebrafish, prompted researchers to test whether behavioral performance was altered in mct8−/− larvae. Using a video-tracking behavioral system, they found that mct8−/− larvae exhibited reduced overall activity during both day and night, as well as reduced maximum velocity and altered responses to day/night transitions. These findings suggest that MCT8 is involved in the mechanism that regulates locomotor activity and behavioral response to external stimuli.In summary, AHDS is a complex genetic neurological disorder characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, spastic paraplegia, lack of speech, and severe cognitive deficiency. The underlying mechanism is thought to involve a defect in the MCT8-dependent neuronal entry of TH, leading to impaired neurological development. However, the location of altered neuronal circuits and the nature of deficiencies remain elusive, and adequate treatment is not available. Research using animal models, such
 Natural selection drives populations towards higher fitness, but crossing fitness valleys or plateaus can be facilitated by population subdivision and migration. In this study, we investigate the effect of subdividing an asexual population on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau using a minimal model that includes only population subdivision into equivalent demes connected by global migration. We determine the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision, assuming the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest. We show that isolated demes must be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, we obtain analytical expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved, and verify our analytical predictions through stochastic simulations. Our results demonstrate that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus over a wide range of parameters, both with respect to a non-subdivided population and with respect to a single deme. We also discuss the effect of varying the degree of subdivision and the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. Finally, we extend our work to weakly beneficial mutations and to a population connected to smaller islands. Our results demonstrate that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus, and shed light onto the quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur.
 The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a crucial gateway for material transport across the nuclear envelope (NE) in eukaryotic cells. Its structure is composed of various proteins, including nucleoporins (nups), and is highly conserved from yeast to vertebrates. Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) occurs in a channel about 50 nm wide and in a millisecond time scale in vivo. The mechanism of NCT remains elusive, and current imaging techniques fail to capture the necessary time and spatial resolution. Coarse-grained simulations offer an alternative approach to study the NPC and NCT.In this study, a coarse-grained model of the unbiased functional state of the NPC was developed to investigate nucleocytoplasmic transport. The model considers the structural features of the NPC, including the three different groups of nups, and validates the transport of a common-size cargo-complex of 15 nm in diameter. The model predicts a mean first-passage time of 2.6±0.13 ms, with a radial probability distribution that suggests the cargo-complex is most likely found near the wall where it interacts with the FG-repeat layer. The kap-FG hydrophobic interactions were also examined, revealing a highly transient nature with an average lifetime of approximately 1.5 ns.The model also sheds light on the role of cytoplasmic filaments in the selectivity mechanism. In intact NPCs, only 7% of inert cargos could diffuse through the NPC and reach the nuclear basket, while in NPCs lacking cytoplasmic filaments, 46% of inert cargos could enter the central channel and diffuse to reach the nuclear basket. This indicates the defining role of cytoplasmic filaments in the selectivity barrier.The coarse-grained model can be used as a platform to examine transport hypotheses and suggest a plausible transport mechanism. It can also be used to study the mechanics of nups in NCT and related diseases, as protein mechanics have been suggested to have a role in disease conditions. A thorough understanding of NCT mechanism may allow for the development of new drugs that work by intervening in nucleocytoplasmic transport. However, limitations to the coarse-graining approach include poor information about the structural properties of the NPC and its building blocks, which can be addressed by experimental studies measuring material properties of the NPC under the same physiological conditions inside the cell.
 Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterial pathogen that forms persistent infections through biofilms. Biofilms are complex structures composed of bacteria encased in a matrix of proteins, polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and other environmental factors. The composition of the biofilm matrix can affect its resistance to disassembly, and this study investigated how growth media influences the matrix composition of S. aureus biofilms.The researchers grew S. aureus biofilms in two different media, tryptic soy broth supplemented with glucose (TSBg) and peptone-NaCl-glucose (PNG). They then used enzymes to test the biofilm resistance, including proteinase K, DNaseI, and dispersin B. Biofilms grown in TSBg rapidly disassembled after enzymatic treatment, while those grown in PNG did not. The researchers also assessed the ability of biofilms attached at the air-liquid interface of glass culture tubes to withstand exposure to an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Again, biofilms grown in TSBg were more sensitive to surfactant-mediated disassembly than those grown in PNG.The researchers hypothesized that growth in PNG alters the matrix composition, increasing the biofilm's resistance to enzymatic degradation and surfactant dispersal. They grew biofilms in drip bioreactors under sensitive (TSBg) or resistant (PNG) conditions for five days and found that enzyme-resistant biofilms contained extracellular fibers, but not in enzyme-sensitive biofilms. The fibers had a central diameter of approximately 12 nm and were closely associated with bacterial cells. The researchers also observed identical fibers associated with biofilm cells in several lab strains and six clinical isolates.To identify the protein composing these fibers, they used two approaches to take advantage of the biophysical characteristics of functional bacterial amyloids. They isolated large insoluble structures from biofilm samples using SDS-PAGE and observed protein enrichment in the FA-treated sample. MS analysis identified the same peptides in each sample, regardless of the band's migration through the gel matrix. These proteins were the alpha (αPSM) phenol soluble modulins and the S. aureus delta hemolysin (δ-toxin).The researchers also isolated fibers from biofilm cells using a tissue homogenizer, incubated fiber isolates for 48 hours at pH 2 with pepsin, and analyzed the sample with MS. They detected the same αPSM peptides present in the SDS-PAGE isolation, plus two beta PSMs (βPSM). αPSM3 was not identified in either preparation, but it likely would not be detected after extensive digestion due to its sequence containing several trypsin cleavage sites.The same fiber isolation procedure revealed no visible fibers by TEM when biofilms were grown in TSBg. They generated an ΔαβPSM double-knockout mutant and assessed fiber production. TEM analysis of biofilm cells revealed that this mutant did not produce fibers after five days of growth in PNG media compared to the wildtype parent strain grown under the same conditions. Fibers could be isolated from wildtype but not mutant biofilms, and fiber production was complemented by expression of the αpsm and βpsm operons in trans.The researchers assayed synthetic PSMs peptides for their capacity to form fibers in vitro. They observed a robust increase in normalized fluorescence and greater peptide concentration increased ThT fluorescence and showed rapid binding kinetics similar to an amyloid-nucleator system. PSM fibers exposed to ThT exhibited an emission spike near 490 nm that is also observed in other amyloid fibrils. Incubation of PSM fibers with the dye Congo red resulted in a characteristic absorbance “red shift,” indicative of cross β structure conserved in all amyloid fibers. Furthermore, PSM fibers isolated from solution through centrifugation displayed increased β-sheet content, which is consistent with data published from other bacterial amyloids.These in vitro observations complement the genetic and physiological data, further supporting the notion that PSMs can form amyloid fibrils. The researchers also challenged 
 The Type II Secretion System (T2SS) in bacteria is a molecular machine that drives the secretion of fully-folded protein substrates across the outer membrane. The machinery includes a secretin, an integral outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. Three distinct forms of T2SSs can be distinguished based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. The Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type T2SSs have been further analyzed, with the pilotin being a key difference between them. The pilotin mediates transport and assembly into the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae has been determined, demonstrating convergent evolution as it is functionally equivalent to pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria but structurally unrelated. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, enhances the kinetics of secretin assembly, and homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio as well as a few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS. Bacterial outer membranes incorporate proteins of at least three well-characterized architectures: β-barrel proteins, lipoproteins, and secretins. Secretins are integral proteins which assemble to form multimeric secretion channels in the outer membrane. The T2SS secretin is assembled into a functional multimer by EPEC using a distinct lipoprotein AspS as the pilotin, while YacC, a previously uncharacterized protein with the sequence characteristics of T2SS pilotins, does not function as a pilotin for the assembly of GspD secretin in EPEC. The PulS-OutS protein family was initially derived from conserved domain architecture statistics of four protein sequences, and the current version of Pfam lists 174 non-redundant PulS-OutS protein family members. The hidden Markov model analysis identified a protein called YacC in EPEC, which has limited sequence identity to the E. coli pilotin EtpO but conforms partly to the conserved domain architecture of the PulS-OutS protein family. However, YacC does not function as a pilotin for the assembly of GspD secretin in EPEC, and instead, a distinct lipoprotein AspS functions as the pilotin for GspD in EPEC. The crystal structure of AspS shows it to have no structural similarity whatsoever to the PulS-OutS family of proteins. The T2SS from EPEC and V. cholerae secrete similar substrates, but no PulS-OutS pilotin has been detected previously in genome sequences of V. cholerae, and no high-scoring sequences were detected with the HMM search of the genome of the type strain V. cholerae O1 biovar El Tor N16961. However, using a BLAST search with AspS as a query, the protein sequence VC1703 was detected in this V. cholerae genome and found to have very high sequence similarity to AspS from EPEC. AspS-related protein sequences were found in all strains of V. cholerae and other species of the genus Vibrio, and in Shigella boydii ATCC 9905 and Shigella sp. D9. The T2SS from EPEC and V. cholerae secrete similar substrates, and the expression of the genes encoding cholera toxin and AcfD is known to be co-regulated. In EPEC, SslE secretion is required for biofilm formation, and in V. cholerae, AcfD secretion is required for intestinal colonization. It is unclear how the T2SS secretin is assembled in organisms that secrete SslE/AcfD: EPEC does not encode the pilotin EtpO, and V. cholerae genomes have not been reported to encode any members of the PulS-OutS family of proteins. We sought to better understand how the T2SS secretin is assembled into a functional multimer by EPEC. Hidden Markov model analysis of the genome identified a protein called YacC, which, while having only 21% sequence identity to the E. coli pilotin EtpO, has the conserved features of the PulS-OutS family of proteins. However, YacC does not function as a pilotin
 Burkholderia pseudomallei is a bacterium that can cause the disease melioidosis in humans, despite producing the siderophore malleobactin, which is crucial for iron acquisition in many other bacteria. Surprisingly, a clinical isolate, 708a, lacking the complete malleobactin biosynthetic gene cluster remained fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. To understand the role of other iron acquisition systems in B. pseudomallei, the authors deleted the major siderophore malleobactin (mba) and pyochelin (pch) gene clusters and investigated their contribution to virulence.The results showed that while mba and pch deletions led to reduced siderophore production, the strains still produced halos on CAS plates, indicating the presence of other siderophores. The authors also found that B. pseudomallei can produce salicylate, a known siderophore, in the absence of PchA and PchB, the first two enzymes in the pyochelin biosynthetic pathway.Furthermore, the authors investigated the role of hemin uptake in B. pseudomallei by deleting the hmu and hem loci. They found that Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, while Hem cannot complement a Hmu deficiency. Prolonged incubation of a hmu hem mutant in hemoglobin-containing minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin, suggesting alternate pathways for utilization of these two host iron sources.Lactoferrin utilization was dependent on malleobactin but not pyochelin synthesis and/or uptake. A mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and upon intranasal infection was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. These data suggest that B. pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth. Overall, this study provides important insights into the iron acquisition mechanisms of B. pseudomallei and their role in virulence.
 This study investigated the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection during pregnancy and praziquantel treatment on the immune responses of offspring at age five years. The study found no evidence that maternal S. mansoni infection or praziquantel treatment during pregnancy influenced the prevalence of S. mansoni infection among the offspring. However, children of mothers with S. mansoni during pregnancy had lower IL-10 responses to SWA and higher IL-10 responses to SWA after praziquantel treatment. This suggests that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis, which could have implications for pathogenesis of the disease. The study also noted that children who were resident in peri-urban areas were more likely to be infected with S. mansoni, highlighting the importance of addressing preschool children in schistosomiasis control programs. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between maternal S. mansoni infection, praziquantel treatment, and immune responses in offspring. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings for childhood schistosomiasis.
 Hox proteins, which play fundamental roles in controlling morphogenetic diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals, regulate distinct sets of target genes through a combinatorial interaction with other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements (HREs). The regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. These findings suggest that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small HREs are responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of Hox target genes in vivo.To study the regulation of rpr by Dfd in detail, a minimal rpr-4S3/3′ enhancer able to recapitulate endogenous expression in the maxillary segment was isolated. The 3′ part of the enhancer, which contains all previously defined Dfd binding sites, was sufficient to drive lacZ expression in a few cells located in the anterior part of the maxillary segment. However, mutating all Dfd binding sites in the rpr-4S3/3′ enhancer led to an increase in lacZ expression in the anterior part of all segments, indicating that the Dfd binding sites are not exclusively used for activation but also for repression of rpr transcription.Using a co-expression strategy, seven transcription factors were identified that modulate Dfd-dependent rpr expression: Apt and Gcm activated reporter gene expression, while Brk, Disco, En, and Slp1 repressed lacZ expression. Two of these factors, En and Slp1, have recently been shown to assist Hox proteins in target gene regulation. The effects of these factors on the rpr-4S3/3′ enhancer are specific, as shown by a reduction of rpr transcripts in embryos mutant for the individual transcription factor genes and a loss of the maxillary-mandibular boundary in some mutants.In summary, the findings from this study demonstrate that proper spatio-temporal Hox target gene regulation is achieved by the combined action of multiple transcriptional regulators: the Hox proteins themselves and a large number of structurally diverse transcription factors. The interaction with additional transcription factors is essential for the precise modulation and fine-tuning of Hox target gene regulation, even on the level of the individual cell.
 The antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment involves complex responses in all cell cycle phases and subsequent generations, which is not fully captured by current methods. A proposed experimental/computational approach uses time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data to render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during and after treatment. The effects of treatments are modeled with modules describing the functional activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase. The framework enables the application of different types of modules in each phase and generation, and the models are tested with time-course measures taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy in X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells. The final model provides a complete rendering in silico of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, providing separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. The method enables a detailed study of the mechanisms concurring to build the response to anticancer treatment at the cell population level, providing a unifying view of the effects of radiation and disclosing the dynamics of checkpoint activities and their dose-dependence. The model is also used as a basis to explore the consequences of default or potentiation of specific checkpoints, which could become feasible with new, molecularly targeted co-treatments or may occur in tumors with particular genetic defects. The model works at a high complexity level, including details of the effects in each phase and generation at different treatment doses, and is used to simulate different experimental plans with maximum flexibility.
 The bacterial global regulator H-NS plays a crucial role in silencing horizontally acquired DNA (HGT) to maintain the stability of the bacterial genome and facilitate successful colonization of various niches, including the human host. H-NS interacts with both core genome and HGT genes, but its regulation of these two gene lineages differs. Plasmid R27-encoded H-NS protein selectively silences HGT genes without interfering with core genome regulation, while chromosomally-encoded H-NS targets both HGT and core genomic DNA but differentially modulates them using the Hha protein as a helper. The H-NS system in enteric bacteria presents unique evolutionary features, as the capacity to selectively discriminate between core and HGT DNA may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in silent form and provide a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments. Plasmid R27, a common conjugative plasmid in Salmonella enterica, encodes both hns and hha genes, and both chromosomal and plasmid-encoded H-NS and Hha proteins interact to modulate R27 transfer. The H-NS system's ability to selectively target HGT DNA may contribute to reducing the fitness cost of housing HGT DNA and maintaining the intrinsic regulation of housekeeping genes.
 This study examines the development of neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in 21 women who were superinfected with HIV-1 after an initial infection. Superinfection is defined as sequential infections from different source partners and has been shown to lead to broader and more potent Nab responses compared to single infections. However, it is unclear whether superinfection also impacts epitope specificity and if the epitopes targeted after superinfection differ from those targeted after single infection.Plasma samples were collected from the women at a median time point of 2.72 years post-superinfection and analyzed for Nab responses against four main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope: the membrane proximal external region (MPER) in gp41, the CD4-binding site, glycopeptide residues in the V1/V2 region, and the V3 loop. Using standard epitope mapping techniques and computational sera delineation analyses, the study found that none of the women developed a dominant Nab response to any one of these epitopes. Additionally, 20 of the 21 women's Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence.These data suggest that superinfection with diverse HIV-1 subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, which would provide support for vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs. The study is the first to examine the Nab specificities in a cohort of superinfected individuals and provides insight into the development of a broad and potent Nab response following superinfection. The study was approved by ethical review committees and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
 Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) have gained popularity for adjusting for population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Several LMM methods and software implementations, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, and MMM, have been developed. This study compared the performance of these approaches using a real GWAS dataset of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families and simulated data. The implementations differed in methodology and user-chosen options, such as the method and number of SNPs used to estimate the kinship matrix. The study found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches and high correlation with alternative approaches, except for transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. All LMM approaches were successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches when applied naively to longitudinal data with many repeated measures. The study concluded that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches, but the choice of precise LMM implementation cannot be based on power or type I error considerations but must instead be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use. The study also investigated the use of different SNP sets for estimating pairwise kinship measures and found that a pruned set of SNPs provided robust estimates. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from relevant institutions and informed consent was obtained from participants.
 This study investigated the phenomenon of transient associations among neurons and how they underlie memory and behavior. The researchers recorded ongoing local field potential (LFP) activity at multiple sites within the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex. They found that when the composite activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a threshold, its activity pattern, as reflected in the LFP, occurs without distortion at other cortex sites via fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, called coherence potentials, last up to hundreds of milliseconds and mark periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information. Coherence potentials have an additional degree of freedom in the diversity of their waveforms, which provides a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and allows identification of particular associations. The results suggest that the cortex forms transient associations through a nonlinear process that is analogous to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks. The study used arrays of monopolar tungsten electrodes chronically implanted into the cortex of two adult rhesus monkeys and organotypic cortex slice cultures prepared from postnatal day 1-2 old rats. The researchers analyzed the effects of changes in synaptic transmission by adding DNQX or picrotoxin directly into the medium of the cultures and recorded spontaneous LFP activity for up to 5 hours. They calculated correlations between the LFP triggers and periods of equal duration on each other electrode to evaluate the spatial spread of coherence potentials. The controls included random periods of similar duration, amplitude-matched nLFPs, and an overall greater similarity between large amplitude deflections. The study also performed time-shift analysis to identify the shift corresponding to the highest correlation and calculated intervals between successive correlated periods. Additionally, they quantified amplitude similarity as a function of nLFP trigger amplitude and calculated best-match correlations and peak-to-peak time differences for each pairwise combination of coherence potentials. The power spectrums of coherence potentials were calculated using the Fast Fourier transform, and the phase dependency of coherence potentials was studied by calculating the FFT of the original coherence potentials, shuffling phase angles, and obtaining a new LFP time course using the inverse FFT. The researchers made comparisons of the aggregate or summed unit activity at each electrode to ensure they were working with the maximal amount of unit data and used the dot product between two vectors to quantify the similarity in unit activity patterns between electrodes. They kept the duration of comparison constant and restricted the comparisons to cases where there were exactly two unit occurrences during the period of comparison. The study used the KS test for statistical significance between dissimilar distributions and regression analysis for curve fitting. Significance was established at p<0.05.
 In budding yeast, polarized exocytosis and endocytosis are coupled transport cycles that maintain membrane expansion and polarization. Polarized exocytosis delivers Sec4p, a Rab GTPase, to specific locations on the cell cortex, which in turn induces cortical actin polymerization and triggers compensatory endocytosis. Sec4p binds to Las17p (WASp homologue) in a complex with Sla1p and Sla2p during actin patch assembly. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its GEF Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, while the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays show that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation. This model suggests that Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis, promoting actin polymerization and triggering compensatory endocytosis. This mechanism prevents the escape of membrane proteins from the bud and reinforces the separation between mother and daughter cells provided by the septin barrier. While Cdc42 plays a central role in integrating exocytosis and endocytosis in metazoans, the inter-relationship between Cdc42 and transport cycles involving polarized exocytosis and endocytosis in yeast is unclear.
 Miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, has shown promising effects against Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium, targeting all life cycle stages of the parasite. In the current study, the effect of treating S. mansoni adult worms with miltefosine on exposure of worm surface antigens was examined. The results revealed that miltefosine treatment led to the exposure of four main proteins having molecular sizes of approximately 23, 33, 37, and 120–130 kDa. These proteins were detected in blots of S. mansoni worm homogenate extract reacted against by both the anti-SmI and the anti-SmWH antibodies that had been acid-eluted off the surface of treated worms. The protein bands at ~23 (pr23) and ~37 (pr37) kDa in the SmWH extract were purified by excision and elution from the gel films used for SDS-PAGE. The immunodominant band detected following treatment with miltefosine at ~33 kDa (pr37) was also purified from SDS-PAGE bearing the fractionated crude worm proteins. The purified protein bands at ~33 kDa, ~23, and 37 kDa from SmWH were subjected to MS/MS mass spectrometry, and the results identified them as S. mansoni fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (SmFBPA), S. mansoni tegument protein Sm22.6, and S. mansoni malate dehydrogenase (SmMLD), respectively. The rabbit anti-S. mansoni antibodies eluted from treated worms recognized these proteins, confirming that treatment induced antigen exposure. The protein exposed by miltefosine treatment at ~120–130 kDa was identified as the SmAP protein using indirect immunofluorescence assays and western blotting. Schistosomula that had agglutinated were also positive in indirect immunofluorescence labelling of their surfaces. Overall, the study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent and suggests that the exposed antigens could have potential as intervention targets and antibodies against these antigens may act to increase the drug’s anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection.
 This study investigates the role of Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. Previous research has shown that Myosin Va, a plus-end-motor, plays a critical role in targeting transmembrane proteins to dendrites. However, the function of myosin motors in axonal targeting is unknown. In this study, the authors show that Myosin VI plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that has been shown to underlie the localization of many axonal proteins. They also find that a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon in mice in vivo, suggesting it could be a useful tool for probing circuit structure and function. Overall, these results indicate that myosins help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins.After synthesis in the secretory pathway, axonal and dendritic transmembrane proteins follow distinct transport pathways to the plasma membrane. Axonal proteins enter both axons and dendrites, while dendritic proteins are transported directly to the somatodendritic domain without entering the distal axonal domain. Axonal proteins that are carried to the dendrites are unloaded onto the plasma membrane and subsequently reloaded into vesicles that travel to the axonal membrane. The net effect of these processes is that axonal transmembrane proteins are distributed roughly evenly to the intracellular regions of both the axon and dendrites, but are dramatically enriched on the axonal membrane. The transport of both axonal and dendritic proteins is mediated by kinesin motors. However, targeting of dendritic proteins cannot be explained by the intrinsic properties of dendritic kinesins, and recent work from the laboratory indicates that vesicles are targeted to dendrites through the actions of plus-end-directed myosin motors, which direct the vesicles away from the axon and towards the cell body. Of the 35 known classes of myosin motors, only one, Myosin VI, is known to move towards the pointed (or minus) end of actin filaments. The involvement of Myosin VI in endocytosis further suggests that it might contribute to the enrichment of proteins on the surface of the axon.The authors engineered non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myosin VI and found that they became highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Disruption of either Myosin VI function or expression led to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myosin VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface at least in part by enhancing dendrite-specific endocytosis. Additionally, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI was concentrated at the surface of the axon in mice in vivo, suggesting it could be a useful tool for probing circuit structure and function.In summary, this study provides evidence that Myosin VI plays a role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis. The findings suggest that myosin motors contribute to the enrichment of both axonal and dendritic proteins at the plasma membranes of the appropriate polar compartments, which is necessary for proper electrical signaling.
 The consensus that complexity leads to stability in ecological systems has been challenged since the 1970s, with studies showing that large, random ecosystems may be unstable. May's seminal work in the 1970s using random matrix theory assumed that systems were at equilibrium and derived a criterion for system stability. However, it remained silent on the feasibility of the equilibria. Later studies found that feasibility was vanishing in species-rich systems, leaving the existence of a feasible equilibrium in complex systems uncertain.The interplay between interaction strength and network architecture is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. In unstructured systems, feasibility is not guaranteed, and stability criteria are trivially satisfied with weak interactions. However, including realistic structure in trophic systems yields different results. For example, the niche and nested-hierarchy models generate structured food webs with negative growth rates and non-trivial equilibrium abundances.The feasibility of a system is essential for stability analysis, as it determines whether the community matrix used in the analysis is meaningful. Future work on dynamical stability should be preceded by a feasibility analysis, which involves knowledge of the structure and intensity of interactions and growth rates. The results indicate that sensible information on the dynamics of natural systems will be obtained by focusing on the interplay between ecological structure, interaction weights, and their distribution in the architecture.However, there are still many other aspects to consider, such as system size, the relationship between trophic position and interaction strength, and the estimation of demographic parameters. The choice of functional response models, the effects of ecosystem engineers, and non-linearities in species interactions are also important. The gap between theoretical and empirical investigations is likely to remain open, and more effort must be devoted to obtaining empirical and experimental time series as necessary benchmarks.
 Vibrio cholerae bacterium colonizes both marine environments and the human gastrointestinal tract, utilizing a multifunctional protein named GlcNAc binding protein A (GbpA) for attachment to different niches. GbpA possesses an unusual, elongated four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 exhibiting structural homology to chitin binding domains. Domain 1 interacts with chitin in vitro, while domain 1 is crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Domains 2 and 3 bind to the V. cholerae surface, and only the first three domains are required for colonization.GbpA's structure was determined using X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering, revealing three distinct domains rich in β-structure. Domain 1 consists of a four-stranded and a three-stranded β-sheet forming a β-sandwich, with a pseudo-domain between β-strands 1 and 3. Domain 2 shows distant structural similarities to the β-domain of the flagellin protein p5, while domain 3 has an immunoglobulin fold with significant structural similarity to over 200 structures in the PDB. The C-terminal domain 4, which shows 26% sequence identity with the C-terminal chitin-binding domain of S. marcescens chitinase B, was not crystallized but is likely to possess an all-β secondary structure.GbpA selectively binds chito-oligosaccharides of varying lengths and binds to α/β chitin, mucin, and intestinal epithelial cells. Domain 1 interacts with both mucin and certain types of chitin, while domains 2 and 3 are required for interaction with the bacterial surface. Competitive mucin binding assays and immunoblot analysis suggest that domain 1 is essential for mucin binding, while domain 4 is dispensable.In summary, GbpA is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in V. cholerae's ability to colonize various environments. Its unique structure and modular interaction properties enable it to bind to both mucin and chitin, providing V. cholerae with versatile binding properties.
 This study explores the impact of sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound found in cruciferous vegetables, on HIV infection in primary macrophages. Macrophages play a crucial role in HIV infection and pathogenesis, forming long-lived viral reservoirs and carrying virus into restricted compartments like the brain. SFN is a potent mobilizer of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is held in check by its constitutive degradation through CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complexes using the protein KEAP1 as a substrate adaptor. When Nrf2 accumulates, it translocates into the nucleus, partners with musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein (Maf), and initiates transcription from antioxidant response elements (ARE).The researchers found that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. This effect is mediated through Nrf2, as shown by a decrease in luciferase activity and an increase in the percentage of GFP (+) cells in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cultures. SFN blocks infection after entry but before the formation of 2-LTR circles, as evidenced by a decrease in viral capsid protein and 2-LTR circles in infected cultures.SFN's anti-viral action is not due to decreased cell viability, as indicated by sustained metabolic activity in primary hMDMs and T cells, HeLa, GHOST, HEK293T, U937, and THP1 cells. The anti-viral effect induced by SFN treatment is reversible, and the duration over which the anti-viral state is maintained depends on the SFN dose.The study also investigated the impact of SFN on HIV-2 infection and whether SFN action is reporter-dependent. The results demonstrated that SFN pretreatment blocks infection at or before reporter production from integrated proviruses, as shown by a decrease in luciferase activity and the percentage of GFP (+) cells in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cultures.Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanism by which SFN blocks HIV infection in macrophages and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition. The findings could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome the limitations of current HIV treatments and support prevention and cure strategies.
