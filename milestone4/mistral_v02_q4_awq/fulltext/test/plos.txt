 This study aimed to investigate the role of lung-resident mesenchymal stem and stromal cells (LR-MSCs) during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection using primary human LR-MSCs and a translational model of human RSV infection in lambs. The findings revealed that RSV infection led to a robust activation of LR-MSCs, characterized by a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory phenotype combined with cytokines modulating T cell function. Additionally, RSV-mediated lung injury stimulated the expansion of LR-MSCs, which mounted a dynamic transcriptional program related to mechanisms of repair and regeneration. The data also indicated a distinct life cycle of RSV in LR-MSCs with viral spread via cell-to-cell contact, which may improve virus dissemination and promote immune evasion. Overall, these findings demonstrate the involvement of LR-MSCs in virus-induced lung injury and have therapeutic implications.
 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala azar, is a parasitic disease endemic in South Sudan, where pregnant women are particularly vulnerable due to changes in the immune system during pregnancy. A retrospective analysis was conducted using routine programme data from a MSF health facility in Lankien, South Sudan, between October 2014 and April 2018. The study included 113 women with VL in pregnancy and 223 non-pregnant women with VL as a comparison group. Women with VL in pregnancy presented with more severe anaemia, were more likely to need blood transfusion, and were more often prescribed antibiotics than non-pregnant women. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage and premature delivery, were reported in 20% of pregnant women where VL was diagnosed in pregnancy and 50% where VL was diagnosed postpartum. Pregnant women were more likely to require extension of treatment to achieve cure. Overall, initial cure rates were high (96.5%) and mortality was low (1.8%) in this cohort of pregnant women with VL. The study highlights the importance of good maternal survival rates in resource-limited settings, despite the high incidence of complications. The largest cohort in the literature of VL in pregnancy, the data suggest that AmBisome is the safest therapeutic option for VL in pregnancy and is the recommended treatment in South Sudan. However, pregnant women with VL often required extension of treatment to achieve cure. Careful evaluation of patients is needed at the end of the standard treatment regimen to ensure proper cure before discharge. Follow-up data would be relevant to determine if women with VL in pregnancy have an increased risk for relapse of VL disease and to understand the risk of pregnancy-related complications after discharge. Commonly reported complications, such as suspected secondary infections, severe anaemia, and obstetric complications, emphasize the need for appropriate medical care in addition to VL treatment for this patient group.
 This study aimed to characterize Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) strains causing invasive disease in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya, over a 12-year period to understand their evolutionary history, relationship to global typhoid isolates, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. Of the 412 Salmonella isolates from Kibera, 310 were identified as S. Typhi and underwent further analysis. By whole genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST), four genetic clades were identified, with the predominant clade (n = 290, 93.4%) consisting of genotypes 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2. All MDR isolates belonged to this clade and were genotype 4.3.1.1. Resistance determinants were identified exclusively in the predominant clade, with the most common being aph(3")-Ib and aph(6) -Id, conferring aminoglycoside resistance, and blaTEM-1, conferring β-lactam resistance. The prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes was similar throughout the study period, but an increase in quinolone resistance determinants was observed. Plasmid markers were identified in the predominant clade, including IncHI1A, IncHI1B (R27), and IncQ1. Molecular clock analysis suggested that genotype 4.3.1 has been introduced multiple times in Kibera, with some isolates forming a clade with genomes from Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, and Tanzania, dating back to around 1997. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of monitoring circulating S. Typhi strains for early detection of antimicrobial resistance patterns to guide empiric antibiotic treatment and inform preventive measures.
 SARS-CoV-2, the third novel coronavirus in two decades to cause significant human mortality, has resulted in over 5 million deaths worldwide. Vaccines are available but global implementation has been slow, allowing for the evolution of new variants that can evade immune responses. To identify potential therapeutics, researchers screened plasma from convalescent subjects for IgG against a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domain, which is highly conserved among human beta-coronaviruses. From these subjects, several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were developed that neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with recognition of all variants of concern (VoC) tested (Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron). The most potent and broad hmAb, 1249A8, emerged as able to recognize all human beta-coronaviruses and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In animal models, 1249A8 demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and its delivery as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal dose protected hamsters from weight loss and significantly reduced upper and lower respiratory viral burden. The combination of 1249A8 with the S1-specific neutralizing hmAb 1213H7 further enhanced therapeutic activity. These results suggest that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential can be induced in humans and can guide universal coronavirus vaccine development. All procedures involving human samples were approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Use at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and informed consent was obtained from participants.
 In this study, the authors investigate the regulation and coordination of the 3-oxoadipate (3-OAP) and gentisate (GP) pathways in the yeast Candida parapsilosis, which metabolize hydroxyaromatic substrates via these pathways. They use the genome assembly of the CLIB214 strain to analyze gene expression and protein levels in response to different hydroxyaromatic substrates. The results show that both pathways are activated by hydroxyaromatic substrates, leading to the upregulation of genes involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, glyoxylate cycle, amino acid metabolism, and peroxisome biogenesis. The authors also identify putative transcription factors, Otf1p and Gtf1p, that function as transcriptional activators of the 3-OAP and GP genes, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of the transcription factors and FA metabolism genes highlights the evolutionary adaptations of yeast cells to assimilate hydroxyaromatic substrates. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of hydroxyaromatic substrate metabolism in C. parapsilosis and the role of transcriptional regulation in coordinating metabolic pathways.
 The paper introduces the Oracle-Supervised Neural Engineering Framework (osNEF), a method for training biologically-detailed spiking neural networks to realize cognitively-relevant dynamical systems. osNEF utilizes an online learning rule that combines insights from several theoretical frameworks, including the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), and can be applied to various neuron and synapse models. The framework demonstrates its utility by producing neural networks that form an appropriate function basis for dynamic computation, performing cognitively-useful operations with high accuracy, and combining these operations into a larger cognitive network that performs a simple working memory task. The cognitive network, built from biologically-detailed components such as Pyramidal cells, inhibitory interneurons, conductance-based GABA synapses, and voltage-gated NMDA synapses, exhibits mnemonic performance comparable to simple animals. The paper also discusses the biological realism, cognitive capacity, and usability of osNEF and compares it to similar methods in the literature. Future work includes applying osNEF to other cognitive systems in the brain and investigating how low-level biological features contribute to high-level cognitive capacity.
 Down syndrome (DS) is caused by the complete or partial trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), leading to a complex syndrome with intellectual disability and various phenotypes. While the dosage imbalance hypothesis suggests that triplication of HSA21 genes results in their overexpression, transcriptomic studies reveal a genome-wide deregulation that is not arbitrary but involves specific molecular cascades. A meta-analysis of all publicly available transcriptomic datasets in human and mouse was performed to identify consistently deregulated genes and pathways.The analysis revealed that genes mapping on HSA21 and their interactors were more consistently deregulated than non-HSA21 genes. Gene co-deregulation often involved genes belonging to the same molecular process or were associated with the same disease ontologies. The most consistent changes were enriched in interferon-related categories and neutrophil activation, reinforcing the concept that DS is an inflammatory disease.The meta-analysis also identified new genes, such as ETNPPL, that could be useful for generating or confirming hypotheses and supporting new putative therapeutic candidates. The results were summarized in a user-friendly web application and an R package called "metaDEA" was developed to integrate every kind of transcriptomic data. The method could be used with other complex disorders, such as cancer.
 This study explores the relationship between neuronal oscillations and evoked responses using a biologically plausible model of a population of neurons in the neocortex. The Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) model demonstrates that alpha frequency oscillations have a non-zero oscillatory mean (OM), which is driven by changes in currents and morphology. The simulations show that an increase in sodium channel densities on the soma leads to an increase in backpropagating currents and a subsequent increase in OM, while extending the apical dendrite of pyramidal neurons causes OM to drop below zero. The model also shows that the strength of currents in the apical dendrite contributes primarily to the current dipole change, and that extending the length of the apical dendrite of pyramidal neurons in layer V decreases the strength of the upward current, causing OM to decrease. The results support the hypothesis that currents in pyramidal neurons are asymmetric and that elongating apical dendrites produces even more asymmetry. The study also investigates the effect of synaptic weights on OM, finding that a bigger stimulation from proximal sources induced an increase in OM, while a bigger stimulation from distal sources is associated with a decrease in OM. The simulations with isolated proximal and isolated distal input represent an exceptional case and serve to demonstrate the effect of proximal and distal drives on dendritic currents and consequently on OM. The other presented results can be conceptualised as intermediate stages between these two extremes. The study also extracts the amplitude envelope of the alpha rhythm from real exemplary EEG data and modulates the number of neurons in the model with the extracted envelope, estimating the baseline-shift index (BSI) to detect baseline shifts associated with a non-zero OM in empirical electrophysiological data. The results show that there is a straightforward dependence between the amplitude of alpha rhythm and low-frequency amplitude that can be measured with BSI. The study also compares the performance of BSI in simulations and real data, showing that simulated data provide robust and stable oscillations that possess little variation in amplitude and frequency, while real oscillations tend to occur with highly varying amplitude including periods of no oscillations. The study also investigates the presence of non-zero mean alpha oscillations in a large data set containing resting-state EEG data, finding that more than 30% of obtained BSIs demonstrated a strong correlation with the amplitude envelope of the alpha rhythm, and around 30% showed a moderate correlation. The study also observes differences in BSI absolute values in young and old participants, with absolute BSI values being larger in the young group. The study also applies ANOVA to test the difference between age groups and conditions, finding that the difference between age groups was significant, while the difference between eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions failed to reach a significance threshold. The study also investigates the effect of power on the difference between groups, finding that power ratio in the alpha band was higher in the young group and in the eyes-closed condition, while power ratio in the low-frequency band was higher in the elderly group and in the eyes-open condition. The study also investigates the effect of spatial synchronisation on the amplitude of macroscopic alpha oscillations and the generation of the baseline shifts, finding that the degree of spatial synchronisation has a strong impact on the amplitude of macroscopic alpha oscillations while not having a considerable influence on the generation of the baseline shifts. The study also discusses the implications of the results for data analysis of EEG/MEG signals and for the interpretation of diverse experimental results.
 Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus that causes a hemorrhagic fever in humans with a case fatality rate of up to 40%. CCHFV has been reported in Africa, Asia, and southern Europe, and recently in Spain due to the expanding range of its tick vector. Although discovered over 70 years ago, our understanding of CCHFV pathogenesis remains limited. In this study, RNA-Seq was used to examine kinetic changes in host expression and viral replication simultaneously in two human liver cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) infected with CCHFV. Through this, numerous host pathways were identified that were modulated by the virus, including antiviral response and endothelial cell leakage. Notably, the genes encoding DDX60, a cytosolic component of the RIG-I signalling pathway, and OAS2 were both shown to be dysregulated. PTPRR was induced in Huh7 cells but not HepG2 cells, and has been associated with the TLR9 signalling cascade and poor outcomes in patients. Additionally, whole-genome sequencing was performed on CCHFV to assess viral diversity over time and its relationship to the host response. This demonstrated that next-generation mRNA deep-sequencing can not only examine mRNA gene expression but also examine viral evolution and typing of the infecting strain. This provides a proof-of-principle that CCHFV specimens can be analyzed to identify both the virus and host biomarkers that may have implications for prognosis. The liver plays an important role in CCHFV infection, as it is an early target organ and involvement following infection is associated with elevated AST and ALT, correlating with poor prognosis. Understanding the host response in liver cells could provide insight into CCHFV pathogenesis. Dual RNA-Seq was used to study both pathogen evolution and host response simultaneously, allowing for examination of host response and viral adaptation over the course of infection. This approach may identify RNA species that would not present on a microarray chip, allowing for characterization of the host mRNAs that undergo a change in expression, leading to the identification of potential biomarkers. Simultaneously, sequencing the virus over time may also lead to the identification of novel variants, which could be of particular clinical importance in outbreak settings. Overall, this study demonstrates that next-generation mRNA sequencing is a powerful method to evaluate the interplay between the host and virus, and sequencing the virus over time may also lead to the identification of novel strains or variants.
 Working memory (WM) deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia (SZ), and previous research has primarily attributed these deficits to decreased capacity compared to healthy control (HC) subjects. However, recent developments in WM research suggest that precision is another important determinant of WM performance. In this study, the authors measured the performance of 60 SZ and 61 HC participants in a classical delay-estimation visual working memory (VWM) task and evaluated several influential computational models to disentangle the effect of various memory components.The results showed that the model assuming variable precision (VP) across items and trials was the best model to explain the performance of both groups. SZ exhibited abnormally larger variability of allocating memory resources rather than resources or capacity per se. Furthermore, individual differences in resource allocation variability predicted variation of symptom severity in SZ, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenic pathology.These findings provide an alternative view to the widely accepted decreased-capacity theory and shed new light on the utility of Bayesian observer models to characterize mechanisms of mental deficits in clinical neuroscience. The study also demonstrates the importance of performing systematic model comparisons before analyzing group differences on model parameters.
 This study identified a primary HIV-1 Env variant, Env E1, which consistently supports over 300% increased viral infectivity in the presence of autologous or heterologous HIV-positive plasma. The Env E1 variant, however, exhibited reduced infectivity in the absence of HIV-positive plasma, which was not due to decreased CD4 binding. Through the use of Env chimeras and sequence analysis, the study mapped this phenotype to a change in the gp41 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region, specifically a change from glutamine (Q) to arginine (R) at position 563. This change, Q563R, disrupts the formation of the gp41 six-helix bundle required for virus-cell membrane fusion. However, antibodies that bind cluster I epitopes on gp41 overcome this inhibitory effect, restoring infectivity to wild-type levels. Additionally, the Q563R change increases HIV-1 sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER). Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of gp41 residues involved in membrane fusion and identifies a mechanism by which host factors can alleviate a viral defect.
 The COnsensus Molecular SUbtype of Cancer (COMSUC) web server was developed to address the challenges of identifying consensus molecular subtypes of cancer from extensive amounts of multi-omics data and discrepant clustering results. COMSUC provides a user-friendly tool for the integration of discrepant cancer clustering results generated by multiple methods and multi-omics data from multiple platforms. It uses eight typical clustering methods and three consensus clustering approaches to identify consensus molecular subtypes of more than 30 cancers. COMSUC is freely available at http://comsuc.bioinforai.tech/ (IP address: http://59.110.25.27/) and can be accessed with most web browsers. It provides interactive and modifiable visualization and publishable output of analysis results, and allows users to exchange consensus subtype results with collaborators via project IDs. COMSUC uses R for algorithms and MySQL for data management and storage. It can be used to identify consensus molecular subtypes using publicly available datasets from TCGA, ICGC, and TARGET, or users' private datasets. COMSUC uses the same feature selection algorithm for preprocessed public data and users' private data before clustering. It uses the "ComBat" function in the "sva" R package for batch effect correction and then performs feature selection before clustering. COMSUC integrates eight typical clustering methods and three consensus clustering algorithms to identify consensus molecular subtypes. It uses the Kaplan-Meier method for survival analysis and the "pamr" R package for subtype signatures. COMSUC provides intuitive analysis of publicly available datasets and allows users to upload their own data for analysis. It provides seven result types, which can be modified interactively for better presentation. COMSUC identifies cancer consensus molecular subtypes by dividing samples into clusters using eight typical clustering methods, integrating these clustering results using one of three consensus clustering methods, and then further integrating the clustering results based on omics data. COMSUC provides a powerful tool for users' efforts to decipher cancer consensus molecular subtypes and for the development of a consensus classification system integrating different clustering results.
 The study aimed to investigate the virome composition, host-virus co-divergence, and long-distance dispersal of tick-borne viruses in the seabird tick Ixodes uriae, which is distributed across both circumpolar regions. The researchers identified 16 RNA viruses, seven of which were novel. They found evidence of viral dispersal within and between the northern and southern circumpolar regions, suggesting that migratory birds play a role in transporting viruses between the poles. The study highlights the importance of the millions of birds that migrate across the globe and have the capacity to transfer viruses to and from adjacent and distant geographical areas.The researchers collected adult female Ixodes uriae ticks from Bonden island in northern Sweden and from a Gentoo penguin colony at Neko harbour in Antarctica. They extracted total RNA from 16 tick pools and performed ribosomal RNA depletion, library preparation, and paired-end sequencing. They identified viruses by screening against non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases and assessing potential endogenous viral elements. They determined the relative abundance of identified viruses by comparing the mapping results of the Ixodes uriae mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene against all RdRp containing contigs.The results showed that several previously discovered and novel viruses were identified, some of which have been shown to have pathogenic properties to birds and/or humans. The researchers found evidence of historic movement of viruses between the northern and southern circumpolar regions, suggesting that they have moved between the poles after the Ixodes uriae population diverged into two sub-populations. They also found that it is likely that virus-infected migratory birds transport viruses between the poles.The study suggests that the avian host likely functions as the dispersal agent of viruses among the circumpolar regions, while tick behavior and presence play a key role in the establishment and maintenance of viruses in circumpolar environments. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of migratory birds in the dispersal of tick-borne viruses and the potential impact on global health.
 RecombineX is a Linux-based computational framework designed for automated high-throughput tetrad analysis. It is a self-contained system that can be installed and configured via a pre-shipped installer script. RecombineX consists of a series of task-specific modules handling different workflow phases: genome and read preparation, parental marker identification, gamete read mapping and genotyping, and tetrad-based recombination event profiling. RecombineX supports both reference-based and parent-based modes. In the reference-based mode, a reference genome assembly and the short reads of the two crossing parents are required. In the parent-based mode, the native genome assemblies of both crossing parents and their short reads are needed. RecombineX identifies markers by aligning parental reads to the reference genome or parental genomes and filters out markers falling in repetitive or CNV regions. It then maps gamete reads to the reference genome or parental genome coordinate systems and performs genotyping. RecombineX uses a genotype purity filter to cull out markers with ambiguous genotype signals and infers missing genotypes by assuming a tetrad-wide 2:2 segregation ratio between the two parental genotypes. It further identifies and classifies recombination events into different categories. RecombineX's marker identification performance was evaluated using simulated data and was found to be highly reliable, recovering over 90% of valid marker targets with 30X parent reads. RecombineX's genotyping accuracy was also assessed using simulated data and was found to be consistent across different sequencing depths and Qnet cutoff values. RecombineX's recombination profiling performance was demonstrated to be accurate and robust using real budding yeast and green alga tetrads. RecombineX's parent-based mode enables analyzing recombination events in their native parental genome contexts, which is valuable for understanding the functional implications of recombination events. RecombineX's simulation module enables fine-tuned simulation-based hypothesis testing, revealing its power and accuracy even when analyzing tetrads with very low sequencing depths. Overall, RecombineX is a comprehensive platform for high-performance tetrad analysis, unifying different functional modules under an integrated framework and providing a generalized one-stop solution for tetrad analysis.
 The APOBEC3 (A3) genes encode cytidine deaminase proteins with antiviral and anti-retroelement activity. The human genome encodes seven A3 paralogs, including three single deaminase domain A3s (A3A, A3C, and A3H) and four double deaminase domain A3s (A3B, A3D, A3F, and A3G). The most potent A3 protein against HIV-1 is A3G, but it is unclear if double deaminase domain A3s have a generalized functional advantage to restrict HIV-1. To test if superior restriction factors could be created by genetically linking single A3 domains into synthetic double domains, researchers linked A3C and A3H single domains in novel combinations. They found that A3C/A3H double domains acquired enhanced antiviral activity that is at least as potent, if not better than, A3G. This gain of antiviral potency is conferred both by cytidine-deaminase dependent and independent mechanisms, with the latter correlating to an increase in RNA binding affinity. T cell lines expressing this A3C-A3H super restriction factor are able to control replicating HIV-1ΔVif infection to similar levels as A3G. These findings suggest that novel combinations of A3 domains are capable of gaining potent antiviral activity to levels similar to the most potent genome-encoded A3s, via a primarily non-catalytic mechanism.The human A3 proteins vary in their ability to restrict HIV-1, with human A3A and A3B having no antiviral activity against HIV-1, while human A3G is the most potent naturally found A3 against HIV-1 and other retroviruses. The human A3 locus has also diversified through polymorphisms that encode proteins with different antiviral activities. For example, the common form of A3C encodes a serine at position 188 and weakly inhibits HIV-1, but a natural variant that encodes for an isoleucine at position 188 has greater antiviral activity. Additionally, A3H has over four major haplotypes circulating in the human population with varying ability to restrict HIV-1.Lentiviruses, including HIV-1, have evolved to encode an antagonist, Vif, that abrogates restriction by inducing A3 degradation. Strain-dependent mutations in Vif affect its ability to degrade different A3H variants, indicating that viral polymorphisms also affect A3 activity. Despite the A3 gene variation in their potency, domain composition, and susceptibility to antagonism by Vif, there are combinations of human A3 proteins that remain unsampled. Novel combinations of human A3 proteins, such as A3C/A3H double domains, may prove to be more effective inhibitors of HIV-1 and are referred to as "super restriction factors."By creating novel double domains from poorly-restrictive single domain A3s, researchers have created a super restriction factor that is at least as potent as A3G even at the lowest end of protein expression. Previous studies have found a direct correlation of increase in packaging to potency of A3s. Therefore, researchers evaluated the packaging of A3C/A3H double domains to get packaged into virions. They found that A3C/A3H double domains have an increase in packaging relative to their single domain counterparts, with A3C-A3H being packaged 4.6-fold more than A3C and A3H-A3C being packaged 9.0-fold more than A3C. However, the increase in packaging alone does not fully explain the increase in antiviral activity, as A3C/A3H double domains have stronger affinity for binding RNA and inhibit reverse transcriptase formation through a deaminase-independent mechanism.In summary, by exploring the evolutionary space of the APOBEC3 locus in humans, researchers have discovered that novel combinations of poorly active antiviral A3 proteins can be created that are as potent as the most active A3 proteins. These super restriction factors function primarily through a deaminase-independent mechanism, which accounts for their greater antiviral activity relative to A3G.
 This study introduces TumE, a synthetic supervised learning approach for inferring ongoing selection and subclonal dynamics in bulk-sequenced tumor biopsies using variant allele frequency (VAF) information. TumE integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks to accurately and efficiently detect positive selection, deconvolute selected subclonal populations, and estimate subclone frequency. The method significantly improves accuracy and inference time compared to existing methods and allows for transfer learning to be used for related evolutionary inference tasks, reducing data and computational time for further model development. The extensible framework provides a foundation for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and the cancer patient.The study generates synthetic data using two complementary approaches for tumors subject to positive selection and neutral evolution. For tumors simulated under positive selection, a well-established framework of cancer evolution is used, modeling exponential tumor growth under a stochastic branching process and allowing for a fully stochastic arrival of driver mutations with multiplicative fitness. For tumors evolving neutrally, a generative sampling process is used based on the observation that VAF distributions from tumors without positively selected subclones can be described by a power-law or Pareto distribution in conjunction with a dispersed clonal peak.TumE models are trained using synthetic VAF distributions and optimized using a neural network. The synthetic data generation framework is designed to generate neutral and positive synthetic tumors in pairs, ensuring that they are not out of distribution with each other. The method is shown to significantly improve accuracy and inference time compared to existing methods for detecting positive selection, deconvoluting selected subclonal populations, and estimating subclone frequency.Transfer learning is employed to leverage stored knowledge within TumE models for related evolutionary inference tasks, substantially reducing data and computational time for further model development. The method is validated in millions of synthetic tumors and applied to 88 copy-number and purity-corrected whole-genome and whole-exome sequenced tumor biopsies. The results demonstrate that TumE significantly outperforms frequency-based summary statistics and mixture models for inferring ongoing selection and subclonal dynamics in bulk-sequenced tumor biopsies.
 This study investigates the diversity and distribution of trypanosomes, the causative agents of African trypanosomiasis in humans (HAT) and animals (AAT), in the Southern Chad regions of Mandoul and Maro. The study collected 1,164 human and 640 cattle blood samples and 177 tsetse flies. Trypanosomal DNA was detected in 159 (34.4%) of 462 cattle from Maro, and 64 (82.1%) of 78 cattle from Mandoul. T. congolense was the most frequently detected species in Maro, while T. theileri was the most frequent in Mandoul. T. vivax was the most frequent in both human and tsetse samples. The study also identified an unknown Trypanosoma sp. in a human sample from Maro, and T. grayi and T. godfreyi in tsetse flies. The results suggest a higher diversity of Trypanosoma species in the Maro area than in Mandoul. The study highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling tsetse flies and other vectors to prevent the resurgence of HAT and AAT infections. The findings also emphasize the need to investigate the infectivity of the unknown trypanosome species regarding their zoonotic potential. The study should be widened to other trypanosome hosts to capture the whole diversity of circulating trypanosomes. The study was approved by the national bioethics committee and all participants gave written consent.
 Schistosoma hybridization is a significant evolutionary phenomenon that raises questions about species integrity. Inter-species hybridization occurs between Schistosoma haematobium and S. bovis, which can cause public health and veterinary issues. Recent genomic evidence suggests that some S. haematobium populations show signatures of genomic introgression from S. bovis. In this study, 19 isolates from a wide geographical range across Africa were analyzed, including 11 S. haematobium, 6 S. bovis, and 2 hybrids.Using whole genome sequencing, 56,181 biallelic SNPs were developed, which allowed clear differentiation between S. haematobium and S. bovis isolates. All S. haematobium isolates except the one from Madagascar displayed signatures of genomic introgression from S. bovis. The Invadolysin gene, an introgressed tract previously detected in some introgressed S. haematobium populations, was identified in isolates from Egypt, Corsica, and Mali.The results suggest that introgression from S. bovis is widespread across S. haematobium and that the observed introgression is unidirectional. The low genetic diversity in the S. haematobium cluster compared to the S. bovis cluster and the absence of geographic structure in S. haematobium at the African continent scale confirm previous findings that S. haematobium is a genetically depauperate species compared to other Schistosoma species. The SNPs developed in this study will be a valuable tool for future studies to better understand the evolutionary history of S. haematobium, S. bovis, and S. haematobium-bovis hybrids, and facilitate deeper insights into the epidemiology of schistosomiasis across Africa.
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines have not been successful in clinical trials. Secretory IgA (sIgA) in the form of dimeric IgA (dIgA) is a prime candidate for potential HIV vaccines due to its abundance in mucosal tissues, including the colon, a primary site for HIV transmission. To investigate the role of dIgA in HIV interaction with mucosal barriers and viral penetration in colorectal tissue, researchers used PET imaging and fluorescent microscopy to determine the distribution and localization of 64Cu-labeled, photoactivatable-GFP HIV (PA-GFP-BaL) and fluorescently labeled dIgA.The results showed that HIV virions rapidly disseminate throughout the colon two hours after exposure. The presence of dIgA resulted in an increase in virions and penetration depth in the transverse colon. Moreover, virions were found in the mesenteric lymph nodes two hours after viral exposure, and the presence of dIgA led to an increase in virions in mesenteric lymph nodes. These findings enable in vivo and in situ visualization of antibody-virus interactions and detailed investigations of early events in HIV infection.dIgA antibodies play an important immunological role in the mucosa, primarily preventing further infection by immune exclusion. In the gut, IgA has two subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, which differ structurally from each other in their hinge region. Both IgA1 and IgA2 have the ability to bind and sequester pathogens, creating the need to study the role of both in potential protection from HIV rectal transmission. IgA plays an important immunological role in the mucosa by preventing further infection through immune exclusion. In this process, dIgA binds pathogens while associating with mucus, cell-associated mucins, and other factors in the glycocalyx, thus trapping and excluding the pathogen's ability to enter underlying tissues.Vaccines can protect hosts from infection by directing the production of antibodies that form immune complexes with antigens. While there is currently no effective vaccine for HIV, one that elicits a response in the IgA class might be a strong candidate given the high concentration of IgA in colorectal tissue. IgA plays an important immunological role in the mucosa, primarily preventing further infection through immune exclusion. In the gut, IgA has two subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, which differ structurally from each other in their hinge region. Both IgA1 and IgA2 have the ability to bind and sequester pathogens, creating the need to study the role of both in potential protection from HIV rectal transmission.To gain insights into the ability of dIgA antibodies to mediate protection from mucosal challenge, researchers previously developed a non-human primate (NHP) model to examine the potential role mucosal IgA has in protection against rectal challenge with SHIV-1157-ipEL-p, a clade C, tier 1 CCR5-tropic virus. Through investigating the role of IgG1, dIgA1, and dIgA2 isotypes of the HIV-specific HGN194 monoclonal antibody specificity in SHIV-1157-ipEL-p rectal acquisition in rhesus macaques (RMs), they found that HGN194 dIgA1, rectally applied 30 minutes before rectal challenge, provided 83% protection (5 out of 6 animals), whereas HGN194 dIgA2 only protected 17% of the RMs (1/6). Intravenous HGN194 IgG1 given at a low dose provided 0% protection (0/6), but giving both intravenous low-dose HGN194 IgG1 and rectally applied HGN194 dIgA2 treatments afforded 100% protection (6/6).Despite the promise provided by these observations of IgA function to prevent rectal transmission in a RM model, mechanistic insights to the role mucosal dIgA could play in mediating the prevention of HIV acquisition when combined with an IgG that cannot block infection but instead causes a slight delay in the peak vir
 Iliski is an open-source software dedicated to the computation of Transfer Functions (TFs) between two signals, designed to address the complex relationships between biological signals. It offers various pre-treatment routines and TF computation processes, including deconvolution and optimization algorithms. Iliski was applied to neurovascular coupling (NVC) data, highlighting its benefits and caveats in TF computation and evaluation. The software is available on GitHub and can be used on common operating systems, either within the MATLAB environment or as a standalone application.Iliski's features include two input file formats, smoothing functions, and interpolation options. It offers two main types of TF computation: deconvolution and function optimization. Deconvolution is straightforward and does not require specific settings, while function optimization requires further settings depending on the chosen algorithm. Users can input their own function or add it to the default ones. The TF dimension is user-defined, with settings for TF duration and 'Sampling Time' parameters.Iliski uses the Pearson coefficient and residual sum of squares as evaluation metrics. The Pearson coefficient focuses on the dynamic, allowing for inter-subject comparisons, while the residual sum of squares evaluates the overall fit, considering the amplitude of the prediction. The optimization algorithms tested in the study all use the residual sum of squares as the cost function.Iliski allows for loading previously computed results structures and saving results as XLS files, MAT-files, or in the Matlab workspace. It is accessible both as a GUI and as a set of functions to be used in scripts. It was developed using Matlab R2018a and has dependencies on the Optimization Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, and Global Optimization Toolbox. Common user errors are prevented by various messages and fail safes, and all errors are treated and saved in a log file for efficient bug-fixing.The software was initially developed for data analysis in Biology but has features suitable for diverse applications. It was used in a study on multi-modal recordings of neurovascular coupling using two-photon microscopy and ultra-fast functional ultrasound. The study tested many deconvolution and optimization algorithms to choose the best-suited approach for the required task. Iliski is a valuable tool for understanding complex relationships between biological signals and can be used to extract TFs from time series data in various fields.
 The Zika virus, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, can cause Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) if a mother contracts it before or during pregnancy. CZS can lead to feeding difficulties due to physical and developmental consequences such as microcephaly, dysphagia, and an increased likelihood of choking. A qualitative evidence synthesis was conducted to inform WHO infant feeding guidelines, focusing on the values and preferences of stakeholders regarding infant feeding in the presence of CZS and severe disability and nonprogressive, chronic encephalopathies. Six CZS studies and eight indirect studies were included, highlighting the preference for breastfeeding, the importance of support and advice from healthcare professionals, and the desire for individual maternal autonomy in feeding decisions. Confidence in most findings ranged from low to moderate. The evidence base has limitations, but consistently reported that parents of children with feeding difficulties due to CZS or similar conditions need information, advice, and counselling, as well as substantial emotional support. However, optimal feeding and support strategies for this population have not yet been identified. Practical and economic concerns around having a child with CZS or other neurodevelopmental disorders that impair infant feeding add to the stress and anxiety experienced by mothers and infants. Indirect evidence from mothers of infants with cerebral palsy suggests that group workshops for women with affected infants may be helpful in addressing deficiencies in the wider health system. Further research is needed to determine the most effective and feasible ways to provide information and support to mothers and infants in the context of CZS and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
 This study describes the detailed characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. The nanoparticles were engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations and presented twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. The results showed that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties and elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component when compared to soluble proteins. However, neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. The findings suggest that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens, but the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined. The study also highlights the importance of multivalent particulate antigen presentation for HIV vaccine development, as it can lead to strong avidity-enhanced interactions with B-cell receptors, efficient crosslinking and opsonization by mannose-binding lectin, and improved trafficking through the lymphatic system.
 Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a member of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily, which infects a broad range of vertebrates including swine and humans. PRV infection can lead to devastating disease and economic losses, and recent studies have shown that variant PRV can infect humans, causing severe damage to the nervous and respiratory systems. PRV has a large linear double-stranded DNA genome that encodes over 70 functional proteins, some of which have been shown to inhibit host innate antiviral responses.One such protein is PRV tegument protein UL13, which has been identified as a suppressor of STING-mediated signaling to inhibit IFN production and antiviral response during PRV infection. UL13 interacts with STING in the cytosol and impairs STING protein stability, while knockdown or deficiency of UL13 enhances the protein stability of STING. UL13 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 5 (RNF5) to promote K27-/K29-linked ubiquitination and degradation of STING, thereby impairing STING-mediated production of type I IFNs and expression of other downstream antiviral factors.The findings suggest that PRV UL13 functions as an antagonist of IFN signaling via a novel mechanism by targeting STING to persistently evade host antiviral responses. This study provides new insights into the strategies used by PRV to evade the host immune response and highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms of viral immune evasion for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics.
 Arthropod-borne viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), require replication across a wide range of temperatures to perpetuate. Mosquito vectors are subject to ambient temperatures, which can have daily fluctuations of over 10°C. Temperature impacts vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival unimodally, with optimal conditions occurring at some intermediate temperature. However, the impact of temperature on arbovirus genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection is poorly understood.To investigate how constant extrinsic incubation temperatures (EITs) of 25°C, 28°C, 32°C, and 35°C control ZIKV vector competence and population dynamics within Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, the authors conducted experiments using a Puerto Rican isolate of ZIKV. They found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures, peaking between 28°C and 32°C for both Aedes species. Transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days for Aedes albopictus. However, fluctuating temperature decreased vector competence.Using RNA-seq to characterize ZIKV population structure, the authors identified that temperature alters the selective environment in unexpected ways. During mosquito infection, constant temperatures more often elicited positive selection, whereas fluctuating temperatures led to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species. These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology, including major effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes.
 In the study, the authors investigated the neural basis of olfactory integration in Caenorhabditis elegans by characterizing the circuit mechanisms underlying the response to a repulsive odorant, 2-nonanone, and an attractive odorant, isoamyl alcohol (IAA). They found that the presence of 2-nonanone strongly blocks the attraction of IAA, and this effect is regulated by genes known to regulate the structure and function of sensory neurons, osm-5 and osm-1. The authors also identified redundant neural circuits that regulate the robust effect of a repulsive odorant to block responses to attractive odorants. The results provide insights into the neuronal and cellular basis of complex olfactory tasks.Caenorhabditis elegans is attracted to various odorants, including IAA, which signals food. However, the chemotactic response to IAA can be disrupted by the presence of a repellent, such as DEET, or a hyperosmotic solution. The authors used a behavior paradigm to study the integration of attractive and repulsive odorants, specifically 2-nonanone and IAA. They found that the presence of 2-nonanone completely blocks the attraction of IAA in behavior and alters the responses of AWB sensory neurons and downstream interneurons evoked by IAA.The authors conducted a forward genetic screen to identify genes involved in olfactory integration and identified three mutants, yx51, yx50, and yx49, which were defective in olfactory chemotaxis and olfactory integration. They also found that these mutants showed dramatically increased portions of animals that made incorrect choices when tested in chemotaxis and olfactory integration assays.The authors sequenced the genomes of all three mutant strains and identified causal mutations in each strain. They found that the phenotype of yx51 was rescued by expressing wild-type osm-5 cDNA sequence driven by an osm-5 promoter, and the phenotype of yx50 was rescued by expressing fosmid WRM0638dE09 that contains the genomic region of osm-1. The results suggest that the mutations in osm-5 and osm-1 disrupt olfactory integration by altering the function of sensory neurons.The authors also found that yx49, yx50, and yx51 were all defective in dye-filling, revealing impaired cilia in these mutant animals. They identified a C to T mutation that changed proline 208 of DYF-7 to serine in yx49. dyf-7 encodes an extracellular matrix protein that regulates the anchoring of dendrite tip during the development of sensory neurons.The authors propose that IAA signals are blocked by 2-nonanone signals in both the sensory neurons and interneurons and that olfactory integration is achieved through reducing IAA-related responses at multiple steps of signal transmission. They also suggest that 2-nonanone evoked signaling silences AVA to abolish IAA-induced suppression. Overall, the study provides insights into the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory integration in Caenorhabditis elegans.
 The study explores the potential of Schistosoma mansoni egg-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a vaccine candidate against murine schistosomiasis. EVs were isolated from cultured S. mansoni eggs using ultracentrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and Lowry's protein quantification. Mice were immunized with three doses of EVs, either with or without alum adjuvant, and challenged with S. mansoni cercariae two weeks after the last immunizing dose. Results showed a significant reduction in tegumentally deranged adult worms, hepatic and intestinal egg counts, and hepatic granuloma sizes, accompanied by remarkable amelioration of their histopathology. Western immunoblotting identified two protein bands of ~14 KDa and ~21 KDa in the sera from vaccinated mice, suggesting that EVs are able to stimulate a specific antibody response. The study highlights the potential of S. mansoni egg-derived EVs as a promising vaccine candidate against murine schistosomiasis.
 Mycetoma, a chronic, inflammatory subcutaneous infection caused by fungi or filamentous bacteria, is a neglected tropical disease with limited data on its burden and complications in Uganda. A retrospective study was conducted to estimate the burden of mycetoma in Uganda by reviewing biopsy reports and published literature. Over a 70-year period (1950-2019), 279 cases were identified, with 30 cases from literature review and 249 cases from biopsy reports. The average incidence was estimated at 0.32/100,000 persons per decade, and the prevalence was 8.32/100,000 persons. Males aged 21-30 were the most affected, and the foot was the most commonly affected body part. Fungi were the most common causative agents, followed by Nocardia species and Actinomycetes. The index of clinical suspicion was low, and diagnosis relied on the presence of multiple nodules and numerous sinuses discharging grains. The study highlights the need for more systematic studies to define the true burden of mycetoma in Uganda. The limitations of the study include the lack of data on treatment and missing data from biopsy reports. Mycetoma is a rare disease in Uganda, and there is a significant gap in data and epidemiological studies. Further studies, including active community-based case findings, are warranted.
 Malaysia's goal to eliminate malaria nationwide by 2020 needs to be extended due to the emergence of simian malaria caused by Plasmodium parasites in humans. While human malaria transmission has been eliminated, simian malaria parasites such as P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, P. inui, and P. fieldi are the new causes of malaria in humans. These parasites are primarily found in macaques, which are the reservoir hosts.Several studies have been conducted in Malaysia to assess the prevalence and diversity of Plasmodium infection among macaques. However, there is no detailed systematic review on the simian malaria prevalence in Malaysia over the past 20 years. Therefore, this study aimed to collect relevant published studies related to the prevalence of Plasmodium species in macaques and the prevalence of infection types through a systematic review from years 2000–2021.The search was conducted using the search term ["Plasmodium" AND "Simian Malaria" AND "Malaysia"] in six databases: Google Scholar, PubMed, CrossRef, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science. Seven articles were selected for data extraction, and all studies showed positive detection of Plasmodium parasites in macaques. The most prevalent Plasmodium species in macaques was P. inui (49.27%), followed by P. knowlesi (26.86%), P. cynomolgi (33.05%), and P. fieldi (4.76%). The prevalence of simian malaria infection type was mono-infection (9.00%), dual-infection (10.00%), triple-infection (10.50%), and quadruple-infection (23.00%).The prevalence of simian malaria was higher in East Malaysia (97.00%) compared to Peninsular Malaysia (45.18%). The forest cover has played an essential role in the prevalence of the disease, as macaques in rural/forested areas were more infected by Plasmodium compared to macaques that live in urban/city areas. East Malaysia has more forest cover compared to Peninsular Malaysia, which is more developed.To reduce simian plasmodium transmission to humans, present malaria prevention initiatives may need to be revised or new approaches created. The authorities, such as The Wildlife Department, might screen macaques for malaria parasites and restrict their population, while public health policies should focus on raising awareness of knowlesi malaria and zoonotic malaria as a whole and ensuring that procedures are in place for timely accurate diagnosis and treatment, particularly in high-risk areas. The use of mosquito repellents, patches, and nets should be encouraged for people living or entering high-risk areas.In conclusion, simian malaria caused by Plasmodium parasites in macaques is an emerging cause of malaria in humans in Malaysia. More simian malaria epidemiology studies among macaques and Anopheles vectors should be carried out to assess the risk of macaques-human infection.
 Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is strongly associated with various malignancies, including B-cell lymphomas and epithelial tumors. EBNA1, a key antigen expressed in all EBV-associated tumors during latency, is required for maintaining the EBV episome DNA and regulating viral gene transcription. However, the mechanism used by EBV to maintain latent infection at the post-translational level remains unclear. In this study, researchers report that EBNA1 contains two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIM2 and SIM3) and that mutation of SIM2 disrupts EBNA1 dimerization, while SIM3 contributes to the polySUMO2 modification of EBNA1 at lysine 477 in vitro. Furthermore, SIM3 is required for the EBNA1-mediated inhibitory effects on SUMO2-modified STUB1, SUMO2-mediated degradation of USP7, and SUMO1-modified KAP1. Deletion of the EBNASIM motif leads to functional loss of both EBNA1-mediated viral episome maintenance and lytic gene silencing. Importantly, hypoxic stress induces the SUMO2 modification of EBNA1, leading to the dissociation of EBNA1 with STUB1, KAP1, and USP7 to increase the SUMO1 modification of both STUB1 and KAP1 for reactivation of lytic replication. The EBNA1SIM motif plays an essential role in EBV latency and is a potential therapeutic target against EBV-associated cancers. EBNA1, as a homolog of LANA encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is involved in maintaining the stability of the EBV episome and regulating host and viral gene transcriptions. The findings from this study provide new insights into the regulation of EBV latency and lytic replication, which could lead to potential therapeutic targets against EBV-associated cancers.
 This study aimed to improve our understanding of the genes regulating grain yield in wheat by focusing on the genes affecting spikelet number per spike (SNS). Previously, a highly significant QTL for SNS was identified on chromosome arm 7AL in multiple genome-wide association studies. Using a high-resolution genetic map, the researchers identified the A-genome homeolog of WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 (WAPO-A1) as a leading candidate gene for this QTL.Through mutant and transgenic plant analysis, the researchers demonstrated that WAPO-A1 is the causal gene underpinning the SNS QTL. Loss-of-function mutants wapo-A1 and wapo-B1 showed reduced SNS, and transgenic wheat plants carrying extra copies of WAPO-A1 had higher SNS, a more compact spike apical region, and a smaller terminal spikelet than the wild type. The results suggest that WAPO1 affects SNS by regulating the timing of terminal spikelet formation.Both transgenic and wapo1 mutant plants showed a wide range of floral abnormalities, indicating additional roles of WAPO1 on wheat floral development. The researchers also identified three widespread haplotypes in the QTL region, each associated with particular WAPO-A1 alleles. The WAPO-A1 allele in the H1 haplotype, which is expressed at significantly lower levels in the developing spikes than the alleles in the H2 and H3 haplotypes, is responsible for reduced SNS. Field experiments showed that the H2 haplotype is associated with the strongest effects in increasing SNS and grain number per spike (GNS) (H2>H3>H1). The H2 haplotype is already present in most modern common wheat varieties but is rare in durum wheat, where it might be particularly useful to improve grain yield.In summary, this study identified WAPO1 as the causal gene for the 7AL SNS QTL and demonstrated its positive effects on spikelet and grain number per spike in wheat. The findings provide wheat breeders with a new tool to improve sink traits with limited effects on heading time. The introgression of the H2 haplotype into varieties that are not limited in source traits can potentially result in increases in total grain yield in favorable environments.
 Scrub typhus is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Orientia, which has recently expanded beyond the Asia-Pacific region, including Chile. The disease is transmitted by larvae of trombiculid mites, known as chiggers, which are also the reservoir of the orientiae through transovarial and transstadial transmission. Rodents serve as the main hosts of chiggers and are crucial to understanding the distribution and emergence of scrub typhus.On Chiloé Island in southern Chile, six sites were identified as probable hot spots of scrub typhus based on previous studies. During the austral summer of 2018, small mammals were live-trapped at these sites, and a total of 244 rodents belonging to seven species were captured. Chiggers were detected on all seven rodent species, with a 55% prevalence rate. The most abundant rodent species, Abrothrix olivacea, represented 77% of all infected animals.Three morphotypes of trombiculid mites were identified: Herpetacarus sp., Quadraseta sp., and Paratrombicula sp. Herpetacarus sp. was the most abundant (93% of infested rodents) and occurred on all rodent species and in all sites except Site 3. The other two species co-parasitized on a few rodents only in Site 3. The overall prevalence of chiggers in different sites showed significant variations, ranging from 25% to 78%. Orientia DNA was detected in 15.8% of mite pools, all of which belonged to the genus Herpetacarus. The three most abundant rodent species, Abrothrix olivacea, Abrothrix sanborni, and Geoxus valdivianus, harbored all Orientia-positive mites.This study is the first to document the presence of rodent-associated trombiculid mites infected with Orientia sp. on Chiloé Island, providing crucial information for understanding the distribution and emergence of scrub typhus in South America.
 During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya, two other viral diseases transmitted by the same mosquito vector, were also circulating. The clinical presentation of these diseases can vary, making it challenging to differentially diagnose them. To quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic, we applied a method using empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to revise reported case estimates.Using data from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for 43 countries in the Americas, we differentiated between confirmed and suspected cases based on laboratory diagnosis versus clinical diagnosis. We assumed that confirmed cases were identified using either reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or IgM assays against ZIKV. We assumed that PRNT90, a confirmatory test for ZIKV, was not used extensively due to its cost and logistical complexity.We estimated that during the fourth quarter of 2015, before widespread reporting of Zika cases, there were approximately 74,200 (95% CrI: 35,400-109,500) disease episodes caused by ZIKV that were misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya cases under the molecular diagnostic scenario. Similarly, under the serological diagnostic scenario, there were approximately 3,100 (-39,100-67,100) disease episodes misdiagnosed during the same period.As reported Zika cases increased and peaked in 2016, the intensity of misdiagnosis also increased, but the direction of misdiagnosis differed by country and laboratory testing method. The differences between the molecular and serological diagnostic scenarios were most notable at the peak of the epidemic, reflecting the much lower sensitivities and specificities associated with serological diagnostics.Our revised estimates of the Zika epidemic under the molecular diagnostic scenario suggest that the epidemic was nearly 40% larger than case report data alone would suggest. These results were driven by the relative numbers of reported cases of Zika and the two other diseases and varied over time, across countries, and with respect to level of data aggregation.However, our estimates substantially underestimate the true number of ZIKV infections that likely occurred, as they do not account for unreported infections. Additionally, our approach had some limitations, including the inability to explore differences in the extent of misdiagnosis between Zika and dengue or chikungunya, the reliance on a limited set of empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, and the lack of information about where and when molecular versus serological approaches were used.Despite these limitations, our findings underscore the importance of considering the observation process through which passive surveillance data is collated and the need to develop methods that disentangle which pathogen is circulating at a given time and place. This could help make it more feasible to implement pathogen-specific response measures, such as proactively testing pregnant women for ZIKV during a Zika epidemic.
 Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a partially double-stranded DNA virus that replicates through reverse transcription of a pregenomic (pg) RNA intermediate in hepatocytes. HBV RNA can be detected in virus-like particles (VLPs) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patient serum and has been utilized as a biomarker for intrahepatic cccDNA activity in treated patients. However, the biogenesis and molecular characteristics of serum HBV RNA remain unclear. In this study, researchers found that encapsidated serum HBV RNA predominantly consists of pgRNA, which are detergent- and ribonuclease-resistant. They demonstrated that pgRNA-containing nonenveloped capsids and a minor population of pgRNA-containing virions are present in cell culture supernatant. The formation of pgRNA-virion requires both capsid assembly and viral envelope proteins, which can be inhibited by capsid assembly modulators and an envelope–knockout mutant, respectively. Furthermore, pgRNA-virion utilizes the multivesicular body pathway for egress in a similar way as DNA-virion morphogenesis. Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and 3’ RACE assays revealed that serum/supernatant HBV pgRNA are mainly spliced and devoid of the 3’-terminal sequences. pgRNA-virion collected from cells treated with a reversible HBV priming inhibitor L-FMAU was unable to establish infection in HepG2-NTCP cells. In summary, serum HBV RNA is secreted in noninfectious virion-like particle as spliced and poly (A)–free pgRNA. This study sheds light on the molecular biology of serum HBV RNA in HBV life cycle and aids the development of serum HBV RNA as a novel biomarker for CHB diagnosis and treatment prognosis.
 Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major public health concern, with the emergence of drug-resistant strains exacerbating the issue. Mtb encodes multiple DNA repair pathways, including base excision repair (BER), which plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity. Mtb possesses a GC-rich genome, making it susceptible to cytosine deaminations and resulting in uracils in the DNA. UDGs encoded by ung and udgB initiate the repair process, and their deletion was investigated for its impact on the pathogen's adaptation.Gene replacement mutants of uracil DNA glycosylases were generated, and the double KO mutant, RvΔdKO, exhibited a remarkably higher spontaneous mutation rate and higher survival rates in guinea pigs. Competition assays revealed the superior fitness of RvΔdKO over Rv in both ex vivo and in vivo conditions. The accumulation of mutations in RvΔdKO led to the identification of drug targets, allowing for the facile identification of resistance mechanisms.The findings suggest that compromised DNA repair results in the accumulation of mutations, and a subset of these mutations drives adaptation in the host. This property can be utilized to better understand the evolution of drug resistance in Mtb and potentially identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.
 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in rats and mice is composed of approximately 10,000 heterogeneous clock cells, yet it maintains a high degree of circadian phase coherence. This coherence is believed to be achieved through multiple cell-to-cell coupling mechanisms, including action potential (AP)-mediated connectivity. However, little is known about the morphology of AP-mediated connectivity at a cellular scale. In this study, researchers explored various network morphologies to identify plausible features of SCN networks.They considered network models reflecting an experimentally obtained 'indegree distribution' and a 'physical range distribution of afferent clock cells.' They then evaluated the models based on several criteria, including level of phase dispersal and direction of wave propagation, phase-resetting ability, and decay rate of perturbation-induced "phase-singularities."Successful, realistic networks shared several features: 1) a positive correlation between 'indegree' and 'outdegree'; 2) cells in the SCN ventrolateral region (core) having a much larger total degree than those in the dorsal medial region (shell); 3) the number of intra-core edges being about 7.5 times that of intra-shell edges; and 4) the distance probability density function for afferent connections fitting well to a beta function.The researchers simulated various network morphologies, covering nine different types of indegree-outdegree relations and different levels of clustering and assortativity coefficients. They required that the shell's phase be ahead of the core's phase by at least one hour and that the core recover its phase coherence faster than the shell after regional cell-to-cell phase coherence is disrupted.The chosen network morphologies had two properties: 1) indegree and outdegree were positively correlated; and 2) the nodes in the core had many more edges than those in the shell. These findings could guide future explorations on the AP-mediated clock cell connectome within the SCN.
 The Lexical Categorization Model (LCM) is a hypothesis that explains the functional role of the left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lvOT) during reading. The LCM assumes that lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filtering out orthographic strings without meaning. The model successfully simulates benchmark results from functional brain imaging studies and outperforms alternative models in predicting lvOT activation across three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies.The LCM is based on the assumption that word recognition in the ventral visual stream involves word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization before one can access word meaning. Word-likeness is estimated using the orthographic Levenshtein distance (OLD20), which measures the similarity of any two strings of letters based on the number of insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions of two adjacent letters. The LCM assumes that for words with high word-likeness, one can implement lexical categorizations with high certainty, while for words with intermediate word-likeness, the lexical categorization uncertainty is higher.The LCM rests on the assumption that lvOT implements lexical categorization to filter out perceived letter strings that are not known, and the uncertainty associated with this filter function in the face of overlapping distributions at intermediate levels of word-likeness reflects the difficulty to implement the lexical categorization. The information-theoretical concept of entropy is used to describe the non-linear response profile of lvOT, as it reflects the uncertainty of the lexical categorization given the word-likeness of the letter string.The LCM was evaluated using three fMRI studies and one behavioral training study. The results showed that the LCM successfully simulates published fMRI results and is supported by empirical evaluations using tailored stimulus sets that differentiate between alternative models. The word-likeness representation is estimated in brain regions posterior to word-sensitive lvOT cortex, and after non-words are filtered out by the categorization process, familiar words are passed through to higher-level cognitive processes such as lexical access and the extraction of word meaning, which are postulated to occur in downstream temporal and possibly inferior frontal areas.
 The circadian clock significantly influences the immune system, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to inflammatory pathologies. Shift work, which disrupts the natural light-dark cycle, can cause serious health problems, including impairment in immune function. To better understand the mechanisms behind the weakened immune system in shift workers, researchers have developed a mathematical model of the mammalian pulmonary circadian clock coupled to an acute inflammation model in male and female rats.The model reproduces the clock gene expression in the lung and the immune response to various doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Under normal conditions, the model predicts that a host is more sensitive to LPS at circadian time (CT) CT12 due to a dynamic change of Interleukin 10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The key modulator of IL-10 activity throughout the circadian day is REV-ERB. The model also predicts a reversal of the times of lowest and highest sensitivity to LPS, with males and females exhibiting an exaggerated response to LPS at CT0, which is countered by a blunted immune response at CT12.Females produce fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines than males, but the extent of sequelae experienced by males and females varies across the circadian day. The model can serve as an essential component in an integrative model that will yield mechanistic understanding of how shift work-mediated circadian disruptions affect the inflammatory and other physiological responses.
 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces a significant risk of introducing vector-borne tropical diseases, including dengue fever virus (DENV), due to rapid urbanization, global trade, and large numbers of visitors during Hajj and Umrah. This study estimated the cost of illness (COI) of DENV in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 2017, using data from referral centers in the western region, which is the endemic region of the country.The study used a bottom-up approach to estimate direct costs based on actual costs calculated from a representative sample of patients treated in various hospitals. Indirect costs, which include productivity loss, were estimated using the human capital model based on gross domestic product adjusted for invalidity duration. The study observed the highest estimated costs in 2016, with over US$168.5 million total costs, including direct (US$29 million) and indirect (US$139.5 million) costs for 4415 confirmed cases. The total DENV COI for the five-year period was estimated as US$551 million for 15,369 patients.Productivity years loss accounted for 63.3% to 83.8% of the estimated total costs, depending on the year. The economic burden of dengue in Saudi Arabia is substantial, costing US$110.2 million per year, emphasizing the urgent need for an effective national prevention strategy to reduce morbidity and perform cost-savings.The study's limitations include the potential under-reporting of cases, which was adjusted by using an expansion factor of 3. The study also did not consider the costs of preventive measures, vector control, or surveillance programs, which may increase the overall costs. Future studies should assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination campaigns and other preventive and surveillance programs in Saudi Arabia.Dengue fever is a significant global problem, causing a significant health economic burden, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of the World Health Organization. The economic burden of dengue is likely to be higher than other major infectious diseases, and the main outline indicates that the burden is remarkably enormous in low-income and middle-income countries. Costing methods, such as cost-consequence analysis, cost minimization analysis, and cost-of-illness analysis, can be used to investigate disease costs. COI studies evaluate the direct and/or indirect costs of a disease or its risk factors. The diagnostic and management approaches represent the main costly processes in dengue, and treatment remains symptomatic, with hospital admission required for severe cases, which may entail high costs. Indirect costs related to loss of productivity can emerge from decreased working days of patients or their families, travel, absence from schools or activities, etc., which may account for up to 60% to 70% of the total dengue costs. However, such indirect costs may be partly underestimated or difficult to estimate because they are often incurred by the patients or their families while other direct costs are readily available.In conclusion, the economic burden of dengue fever in Saudi Arabia is substantial, costing US$110.17 million per year, with productivity years loss accounting for approximately 80% of the total costs. Future studies should employ a multiregional approach, using standardized monetary units, quantifying cyclical patterns of the vector and health burden, and investigating the cost-effectiveness of a dengue vaccine to overcome potential biases and limitations. Intensified vector control should also be a critical component of health sector planning in Saudi Arabia, particularly during Hajj and Umrah, to prevent the transmission of dengue and other vector-borne neglected tropical diseases.
 This study investigates the presence and potential impact of nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) in Caenorhabditis elegans intestinal and germ cells. The authors found that nLDs occur normally in intestinal and germ cells, but their distribution and potential effects differ between the two tissues. In intestinal cells, nLDs are associated with damage, including nuclear ruptures and the formation of large nuclear cysts. In contrast, germ cell nuclei appear relatively unchanged during the self-fertile period, and nearly all germ cells produce normal embryos when the apoptosis pathway is blocked. The authors propose that the lack of ER and the presence of a dense concentration of ribosomes in pachytene germ cells might contribute to the differences in nLD formation and impact between the two tissues. The study also identifies mutations in the COPI proteins COPA-1 and COPB-2 that result in an increase in nLDs in germ cells, suggesting a role for COPI in nLD formation. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the role and potential consequences of nLDs in different cellular contexts.
 The study investigates the mechanisms of neuronal damage caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a leading cause of bacterial meningitis. The researchers found that pneumococci interact with neurons through the pilus-1 adhesin RrgA and the cytotoxin pneumolysin (Ply), promoting adhesion, invasion, and neuronal death. Ply interacts with the neuronal plasma membrane, increasing the exposure of β-actin filaments and providing more binding sites for RrgA, leading to enhanced pneumococcal interactions with neurons. Ply also induces neuronal cell death possibly through β-actin filament disruption and cytoskeleton instability, and aggregate formation. The findings suggest that both RrgA and Ply contribute to neuronal cell damage and potentially explain why pneumococci frequently cause neurological sequelae.
 In the study of Conspecific male animals, such as the fighting fish Betta splendens, they typically engage in contests for resources and mates but stop fighting after assessing their relative abilities to avoid serious injuries. The behavioral synchronization during fighting in B. splendens pairs is a unique phenomenon, with each male attempting to increase its chance of winning by imposing aggressive behaviors upon its opponent, leading to tightly synchronized behaviors.To understand the molecular basis of this behavioral synchronization, researchers examined the brain-transcriptomic changes in B. splendens during fighting. They found that brain-transcriptomic synchronization was observable to a lesser extent after a 20-minute fight and was strengthened after a 60-minute fight. The study demonstrated that brain-transcriptomic synchronization is a phenomenon that has been widely known at the behavioral level but has rarely been observed at the molecular level and could occur widely among animals.The researchers used RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression profiles of five non-fighting individuals (B), 10 samples from 20-minute fights (D20), and 10 samples from 60-minute fights (D60). They found that the DEGs were obtained from comparisons of gene expression between the non-fighting group (B) with the D20 and D60 groups. The Pearson correlation coefficients of log2-transformed TMM values were calculated separately between two random fish from each group of the D20 and D60. The results showed that the paired fish had higher correlation coefficients than unpaired fish, indicating the presence of brain-transcriptomic synchronization.The researchers also identified synchronized genes using a two-step method. In the first step, they obtained DEGs from the B vs. D20 and B vs. D60 comparisons. In the second step, they determined whether a gene was synchronized or not by calculating the expression distance between two random fish and comparing it to the expression distance between unpaired fish. They found that synchronized genes were defined as genes with a lower expression distance in paired fish compared to unpaired fish.To gain insight into the biological functions of synchronized genes, the researchers performed Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses on the chosen gene modules in WGCNA. They found that the synchronized gene set was mainly enriched in terms related to neurotransmitter secretion, ion transport, and synapse function.Overall, this study provides a framework for understanding synchronization at the behavioral and molecular levels that occurs during a contest or collaboration in higher animals through social interactions. The findings suggest that brain-transcriptomic synchronization may underlie the behavior synchronization between two interacting partners in vertebrates and may occur with collaborative behaviors due to the universality of behavioral synchronization under both competitive and collaborative circumstances.
 Mosquito viruses, both mosquito-specific and mosquito-borne, can cause unpredictable outbreaks of disease. Recently, several unassigned viruses isolated from mosquitoes, including the Omono River virus (OmRV), were identified as totivirus-like viruses with features similar to those of the Totiviridae family. OmRV is a mosquito-specific virus, and its structures, determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, revealed an unexpected protrusion at the five-fold vertex of the capsid. This protrusion is composed of a small protein cleaved from the polypeptide precursor encoded by ORF1. The protrusion might associate with the extracellular transmission of OmRV.OmRV shares high homology in both sequence and structure with the previously reported OmRV-AK4, except for the unexpected protrusion. The protrusion occupies the outermost capsid in OmRV and is most probably the first part attached to the cell during invasion. The mechanism of extracellular transmission of OmRV needs to be further studied, but it may involve the inner core of the protrusion interacting with positively charged substrates and the protrusions inducing conformation changes on the protrusions, causing breakage or disassociation.OmRV and other members of the Totiviridae family, such as IMNV, have a non-segmented double-stranded RNA genome containing two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2, which encode the major capsid protein (MCP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), respectively. However, in both cases of IMNV and OmRV, which have shown to be capable of extracellular transmission, ORF1 encodes a poly-protein precursor. The N-termini of the IMNV and OmRV MCPs are generated by cleavage after a conserved oligopeptide sequence motif, and both viruses have a major capsid with icosahedral symmetry and a T = 1 lattice comprising 60 dimers composed of MCP-A and MCP-B.The structures of five assigned members of the fungus and protozoan virus family Totiviridae have been determined, showing that these viruses lack a fibre-like protrusion on the capsid and are incapable of extracellular transmission, except for GLV. IMNV and OmRV may face a more complex environment when invading metazoan hosts, and the protrusion is probably an adaptation to that environment. The β-jelly roll structure in the OmRV-LZ protrusion may also play roles in cell invasion. However, more evidence and further investigations are needed to understand the mechanism of extracellular transmission of OmRV-LZ.
 This study investigates the role of Ric-8B, a highly conserved protein that interacts with Gαs class subunits from heterotrimeric G proteins, during mouse embryogenesis. Ric-8B acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for both Gαs and Gαolf, and its expression is predominant in the same tissues where Gαolf is expressed. Ric-8B is essential for embryonic development, as shown by the fact that complete knockout of the Ric-8B gene results in mice that are not viable and die early during embryogenesis.The researchers generated mice that are deficient for Ric-8B using two ES cell lines, RRH188 and RRA103, which contain a gene trap vector in the Ric-8B gene. They found that homozygous embryos die around embryonic day 10.5, and that expression from the Ric-8B gene promoter is restricted to the cephalic neural folds and neural tube regions. The levels of β-galactosidase expression are significantly higher in the Ric-8Bbgeo/bgeo embryos when compared to heterozygote embryos, due to the fact that the Ric-8Bbgeo/bgeo embryos carry two copies of the β-geo reporter gene while the Ric-8Bwt/bgeo embryos have only one copy.The researchers also found that mTORC2 activity, but not mTORC1 activity, is impaired in Ric-8Bbgeo/bgeo embryos. This is significant because mTORC2 has been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization, cell survival, and cell migration, and both complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, have been linked to the control of protein synthesis. The results suggest that Ric-8B is required for normal mTORC2 activity during mouse embryogenesis.To further investigate the role of Ric-8B in mTORC2 activity, the researchers generated conditional shRNA-mediated Ric-8B knockdown HEK293T cell lines and analyzed mTOR signaling in these cells. They found that the levels of phospho-Akt (Ser473) are markedly reduced in the shRNA 17 knockdown cells, and that the levels of phospho-S6 and NDRG1, downstream targets of mTORC2, are also reduced in the Ric-8B shRNA17 knockdown cells. These results indicate that not only in the mouse embryo, but also in the HEK293T cells, Ric-8B is required for mTORC2 activity.In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the signals that regulate mTORC2 and reveals a crucial role for Ric-8B in development. The findings may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate mTORC2 activity, which are still little understood. All procedures undertaken in this study were approved by the University of São Paulo Chemistry Institute’s Animal Care and Use Committee.
 Dengue fever, a common vector-borne disease and a neglected tropical disease, poses a significant public health threat, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. The epidemic size of dengue outbreaks varies dramatically across seasons due to factors such as population susceptibility, mosquito density, meteorological conditions, geographical factors, and human mobility. An ensemble forecast system for dengue fever is proposed to address the challenge of predicting outbreaks with drastically different scales.The ensemble forecast system is based on a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type of compartmental model informed by meteorological and mosquito density information, coupled with a data assimilation method called the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (EAKF). The model simulates the transmission of dengue virus between mosquitoes and humans and generates predictions. To account for the dramatic variations of outbreak size in different seasons, an effective population size parameter is introduced and sequentially updated to adjust the predicted outbreak scale.The proposed forecast model generates accurate projections of peak timing, peak intensity, and total incidence in Guangzhou, China, during the 2011-2017 seasons, outperforming a generalized additive model approach. The ensemble forecast system can be operated in real-time and inform control planning to reduce the burden of dengue fever.The study demonstrates the importance of considering population susceptibility, mosquito density, meteorological conditions, and geographical factors in dengue forecasting. The proposed ensemble forecast system provides a promising approach to accurately predict dengue outbreaks and inform public health interventions. However, further research is needed to consider the influence of other factors, such as human mobility and different serotypes of dengue virus, on dengue transmission dynamics.
 The study aimed to develop and pilot an intervention to strengthen the resilience of individuals and families affected by leprosy against discrimination. The intervention was designed as a 10-week family-based program, with sessions focusing on knowledge, thoughts and behavior, rights, and spirituality, and relationships and social support. The study was conducted in urban and rural areas in India and included 80 participants, mostly from low-income backgrounds. The results showed a significant increase in resilience scores for persons affected and family members from Odisha state, but not for participants from Telangana state. The intervention also significantly improved the quality of life of persons affected and family members from Odisha state, which was maintained six months after the intervention. The study highlights the importance of social support, accurate knowledge about leprosy, and acknowledging spiritual beliefs in fostering resilience. However, the study was limited by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of validation of the CD-RISC in Odia language. Future studies should assess the impact of the intervention on internalized stigma, mental wellbeing, physical health, and stressor exposure, as well as explore the relationship between resilience and religion. Overall, the study suggests that the 10-week family-based intervention has the potential to improve resilience and quality of life among persons affected by leprosy and their families, but a large-scale efficacy trial is necessary to determine its effectiveness and long-term sustainability.
 In budding yeast, the shugoshin protein Sgo1 plays a crucial role in establishing biorientation during mitosis by recruiting the protein phosphatase PP2A-Rts1 and the condensin complex to centromeres. The interaction between Sgo1 and condensin is mediated by a Serine-Rich Motif (SRM) within Sgo1, which is essential for centromeric condensin recruitment and the establishment of biorientation. This interaction is regulated via phosphorylation within the SRM, and Mps1, a central kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates Sgo1 within the SRM to regulate the interaction with condensin and thereby condensin localization to centromeres. The findings identify novel mechanisms controlling shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast.
 This study aimed to evaluate the performance of computational T cell epitope prediction tools using a comprehensive dataset of T cell epitopes identified in Vaccinia virus (VACV) infected C57BL/6 mice expressing H-2Db and H-2Kb. The dataset included peptides predicted to bind MHC or experimentally eluted from infected cells, making it the most comprehensive dataset of T cell epitopes mapped in a complex pathogen.The study found that all currently available computational T cell epitope prediction tools were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). These methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top predictions.The performance metrics provide guidance for immunologists as to which prediction methods to use and what success rates are possible for epitope predictions. The benchmark was implemented in an open and easy-to-replicate format, providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools.The study used a dataset of 767,788 peptide/allele combinations and evaluated the performance of 17 distinct prediction approaches. The results showed that NetMHCpan-4.0-L ranked first with an overall AUC of 0.977, followed by NetMHCpan-4.0-B and MHCflurry-L. The ROC curves showed that the performance of the prediction methods varied widely, with some methods having better performance for certain peptide lengths or alleles.The study also examined the effect of excluding 'minor' epitopes from the analysis and found that the number of peptides required to capture 50%, 75%, and 90% of the epitopes varied widely among the methods. The number of epitopes captured in the top 172 peptides predicted by each method also varied widely.The study also compared the performance of the prediction methods based on the T cell response generated by the peptides and found that the performance was slightly higher when measuring the performance based on the magnitude of the T cell response covered systematically.The study also compared the speed with which the different methods could provide their answers and found that matrix-based methods were significantly faster than artificial neural network-based methods on average.Overall, the study found that most of the latest methods perform at a very high level, especially the methods developed on artificial neural-network based architectures. The study also found that methods that integrated MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data performed better than those trained on MHC binding data alone. The IEDB will be updating the default recommended prediction method to NetMHCPan-4.0-L based on the results of this study.
 This study aimed to investigate the relationship between paternal obesity and small for gestational age offspring by examining DNA methylation changes in spermatozoa. Previous research in non-human mammals suggested that such associations could be mediated by DNA methylation changes in sperm. The study profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in matched human blood and sperm samples using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array.The results showed that DNA methylation signatures of human blood and spermatozoa are highly discordant, and methylation levels are correlated at only a minority of CpG sites (~1%). Obesity-associated DNA methylation in blood was not generally reflected in spermatozoa, and obesity was not associated with altered covariation patterns or accelerated epigenetic aging in the two tissues. However, one cross-tissue obesity-specific hypermethylated site was identified, warranting further investigation.The study also compared spermatozoal DNA methylation to that of nearly 6,000 somatic tissue samples, allowing the identification of sperm-specific DNA methylation signatures. Overall, human sperm displays a unique DNA methylation profile that is highly discordant to, and practically uncorrelated with, that of matched peripheral blood. The findings suggest that spermatozoal DNA methylation is an unlikely mediator of intergenerational effects of metabolic traits.
 Reovirus, a nonenveloped virus with two concentric protein shells, exhibits serotype-dependent patterns of infection in the central nervous system (CNS). While reovirus rarely causes serious disease outcomes in humans, it can lead to loss of oral tolerance to dietary antigens and cause age-restricted disease. Reovirus infection of the CNS is influenced by the serotype and the capacity to bind sialic acid.To study mechanisms of reovirus neuronal entry and transport, primary rat cortical and sensory neuron cultures were used in combination with microfluidic devices and small molecule inhibitors of endocytosis. Reovirus endocytosis in neurons was found to differ from that in other cell types, as it primarily uses macropinocytosis instead of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Reovirus spreads retrograde but not anterograde in cultured neurons, and its transport occurs primarily in non-acidic vesicles.Reovirus neuronal entry and transport are dependent on microtubules and dynein, and reovirus-containing vesicles acidify after reaching the neuronal soma, where viral cores enter the cytoplasm and establish replication organelles. These findings provide insights into neuron-specific mechanisms used by reovirus to enter and traverse through the highly polarized structure of neurons. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of interventions that block early steps in reovirus infection.
 This study aimed to characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the C-terminal domain (ctCSP) of Plasmodium falciparum's circumsporozoite protein (CSP) in volunteers immunized with the RTS, S/AS01 vaccine. The researchers identified seven mAbs targeting two distinct sites on opposite faces of ctCSP, one site containing a polymorphic region (α-ctCSP) and another a previously undescribed site on the conserved β-sheet face (β-ctCSP). Antibodies to the β-site exhibited broad reactivity with a diverse panel of ctCSP peptides and demonstrated inhibition activity against malaria infection in a murine model. These findings suggest that the β-site could be targeted for prophylactic antibodies and structure-based vaccine design.The RTS, S/AS01 vaccine, which is the most advanced malaria vaccine and has recently been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in Africa, is composed of a virus-like particle containing 19 NANP repeats and the C-terminal region of the strain 3D7 PfCSP linked to the hepatitis B surface antigen protein (HBsAg) and unmodified HBsAg along with adjuvant AS01E. The vaccine showed an efficacy of approximately 50% within the first 14 months of administration in phase 3 clinical trials in Africa, but its efficacy declined over time due to waning titers of anti-CSP antibodies.The study's findings highlight the importance of understanding the spectrum of epitopes in the CSP antigens recognized by protective antibodies and their role in protection, which could contribute to the design of improved next-generation PfCSP vaccines. While potent antibodies against the NANP repeats, minor repeats, and junctional region have been extensively characterized, the roles of PfCSP C-terminal and N-terminal antibodies remain understudied. The researchers isolated and characterized seven C-terminal-specific mAbs from volunteers immunized with the RTS, S/AS01 vaccine, grouped them into distinct epitope bins by competition assay, and characterized their affinity and breadth to further elucidate their potential role in protection against P. falciparum. They obtained crystal structures of the Fab fragments for five of these antibodies in complex with ctCSP, revealing a new epitope region consisting of one face of ctCSP comprised of β-strands in the conserved αTSR homology region. One member of this new class of anti-ctCSP mAbs had anti-parasite activity by conducting an in vivo protection study in mice using transgenic P. berghei that express PfCSP. Overall, this study reveals a conserved ctCSP epitope region that binds antibodies with wide breadth, high affinity, and protective ability, which could be utilized in the design of antibodies as medical countermeasures and next-generation malaria vaccines.
 This study aimed to investigate the differences in lysine malonylation between three Toxoplasma gondii strains (RH, PRU, and VEG) with distinct pathogenicity in mice. LC-MS/MS and immuno-affinity purification were used to profile lysine malonylation in these strains. A total of 1,812 malonylated peptides from 775 proteins were identified, with 111 proteins and 152 sites upregulated and 17 proteins and sites downregulated in RH versus PRU strains; 50 proteins and 59 sites upregulated and 50 proteins and 53 sites downregulated in RH versus VEG strains; and 72 proteins and 90 sites upregulated and 7 proteins and 8 sites downregulated in VEG versus PRU strains. Differentially malonylated proteins were involved in key processes, such as protein metabolism, stress response, glycolysis, and actin cytoskeleton. These findings provide new insights into the role of lysine malonylation in the genotypic differences in T. gondii virulence and offer a resource for elucidating the contribution of lysine malonylation to energy metabolism and virulence in T. gondii.
 Nematode parasites infect approximately 1.5 billion people globally and are a significant public health concern. There is a need for new, more effective anthelmintic drugs. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in nematodes, particularly those in the pharynx, are potential drug targets due to their distinct pharmacology from somatic muscle receptors and insensitivity to many current cholinergic anthelmintics. A novel homomeric nAChR composed of five non-Î± EAT-2 subunits and an essential auxiliary subunit protein EAT-18 was identified in Caenorhabditis elegans and Ascaris suum. This receptor is not sensitive to existing cholinomimetic anthelmintics and has different pharmacological properties than previously characterized nAChRs. The functional expression of this receptor is dependent on co-expression with EAT-18. The discovery of this novel nAChR and its auxiliary protein provides a new potential drug target and a new type of obligate auxiliary protein for nAChRs.Nematodes, including parasitic species, have a complex neuromuscular system that relies on a large repertoire of highly regulated transporters, neurotransmitters, peptides, and ion channels for homeostatic cell-cell communication. nAChRs are pore-forming membrane proteins belonging to the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and are conserved throughout metazoan evolution. They facilitate rapid ionotropic neurotransmission and control various physiological behaviors, including reproduction, navigation, feeding, and locomotion. Nematode nAChRs have a greater number of subunits than vertebrates, and variation in stoichiometry and subunit composition leads to diverse pharmacological sensitivities, making them attractive anthelmintic targets.The pharynx is a neuromuscular organ in nematodes that undergoes rhythmic peristalsis to ingest food and is crucial for survival. Pharyngeal peristalsis is under the control of rhythmic activation by excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (glutamatergic) motor neurons innervating the pharyngeal muscle. Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) in the nematode pharynx are one of the primary targets for avermectins, but little is known about the cholinergic receptors in this tissue.Through genetic screening, Raizen et al. identified eat-2 (encoding a non-Î± nAChR subunit) and eat-18 (encoding a single-pass transmembrane domain protein) as essential components of pharyngeal cholinergic transmission in C. elegans. The functional expression of EAT-2 and EAT-18 from free-living C. elegans and parasitic A. suum was described for the first time. For the first time, a non-Î± nicotinic subunit (EAT-2) was found to form a homomeric ligand-gated cation selective ion-channel. The functional expression of this noncanonical receptor is dependent on co-expression with EAT-18. All previously characterized cation selective nAChRs have at least two Î± subunits with the ligand binding sites located at the interface between each Î± and its adjacent subunit. However, EAT-18 forms part of the mature receptor and functions as an obligate auxiliary protein.EAT-2 has the typical functional domains of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel subunit, including a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a cys-loop, four transmembrane domains, a cytoplasmic domain, and a short extracellular C-terminus. EAT-2 is a non-Î± subunit as it lacks the pair of adjacent cysteine residues in loop-C required for agonist binding. Cel-EAT-18 is a small, single-pass transmembrane protein expressed in pharyngeal muscle and neurons with no vertebrate homologs. There are two splice variants of the gene in C. elegans, encoding EAT-18c (71 aa) and EAT-18d (78 aa), which differ mainly in their C-terminal regions. The coding sequence of EAT-18
 HIV-1 infects CD4 T lymphocytes (CD4TL) through binding the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. CXCR4-using viruses are considered more pathogenic and linked to accelerated depletion of CD4TL and progression to AIDS. However, there are counterexamples to this paradigm, suggesting heterogeneity in the virulence of CXCR4-using viruses. In this study, the role of the CXCR4 chemokine CXCL12 in driving virus virulence was investigated.Through analysis of thirty envelope glycoproteins (Envs) from patients at different stages of infection, it was found that CXCL12-resistant (RES) Envs are frequent in patients with low CD4TL levels, mostly late in infection. RES Envs adopt a more closed conformation with distinct antigenicity compared to CXCL12-sensitive (SENS) Envs. At the level of the host cell, resistance is not due to improved fusion or binding to CD4, but owes to viruses using particular CXCR4 molecules weakly accessible to CXCL12.RES viruses seem more likely to deregulate CD4TL homeostasis, as they have an enhanced capacity to enter naive CD4TL when surrounded by CXCL12, mirroring their situation in lymphoid organs. This work improves our understanding of the pathophysiology and transmission of HIV-1 and suggests that RES viruses’ receptors could represent new therapeutic targets to help prevent CD4TL depletion in HIV+ patients on cART.
 Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is endemic in Palestine and transmitted by Phlebotomus sand flies, which inhabit hyrax dens. Despite control measures implemented since 1996, ZCL cases continue to occur. A study was conducted in Tayasir, Tubas district, to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal fogging with pyrethroids in rock hyrax dens to reduce sand fly density and Leishmania spp. infection.During the study, 13,969 Phlebotomine sand flies were collected, of which 12,203 were from inside hyrax dens and 1,766 from outside. Among all sand flies, 11,846 were identified as Sergentomyia spp., and 1,121 as Phlebotomus spp. from four subgenera and ten species, including P. sergenti, P. major s.l., and P. arabicus. Among Phlebotomus spp., 638 were females.The highest Phlebotomus spp. density was in a natural deep cave designated as the intervention site, with an average density of 164 sand flies/trap/night pre-intervention and 42 sand flies/trap/night post-intervention (-75%). In the control site, the average density was 18 sand flies/trap/night pre-intervention and 11 sand flies/trap/night post-intervention (-40%).Using Mulla's formula, a 19% abundance increase was observed in the intervention site during the whole post-intervention period and especially during the first week of fogging (78% increase). Thermal fogging inside hyrax dens effectively reduced the density of all sand flies and especially of Leishmania infected P. sergenti and P. major (-80% and -74%, respectively).The study highlights the importance of hyrax dens as a source of ZCL infection due to the presence of P. sergenti, which is the most abundant Phlebotomus species and the most infected by L. tropica. Insecticide thermal fogging inside hyrax dens appears to be a promising complementary strategy in controlling ZCL foci in limited-resource settings, especially when applied every two to five weeks. Further studies using a randomized clinical trial design are needed to better explore the impact of fogging as a vector control tool for ZCL.
 The non-coding regions of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA genomes, specifically pseudoknot (PK) structures in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR), play crucial roles in gene expression regulation. The FMDV 5′ UTR is longer than in other picornaviruses and contains multiple PK structures, which are linked in tandem. The functions of these PKs in FMDV infection are not fully understood, but studies using bioinformatics, sub-genomic replicons, and recombinant viruses have investigated their structural conservation and importance in the FMDV lifecycle.Results from these studies show that despite the conservation of two or more PKs across all FMDVs, a replicon lacking PKs was replication competent, albeit at reduced levels. In competition experiments, GFP FMDV replicons with less than two PK structures were outcompeted by a mCherry FMDV wt replicon that had 4 PKs, whereas GFP replicons with 2 or 4 PKs were not. This apparent replicative advantage offered by the additional PKs correlates with the maintenance of at least two PKs in the genomes of FMDV field isolates.Furthermore, a replicon lacking any PKs was not viable, and at least one PK was essential for recovery of infections virus, suggesting roles for the PKs in both vRNA replication and virion assembly. Overall, these findings improve our understanding of the molecular biology of FMDV replication and the wider roles of PK in RNA functions.
 This study assessed the palatability of two new orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulations of Praziquantel (PZQ) in comparison with the currently available PZQ tablet (PZQ-Cesol) in African children aged 6-11 years old. The trial was conducted in a single school in Tanzania and involved 48 children who were stratified by age group and gender and then randomized to one of 12 sequences. The children assessed the palatability of each formulation by tasting it without water on Day 1 and with water on Day 2.The results showed that both L-PZQ ODT and Rac-PZQ ODT had higher palatability scores than PZQ-Cesol when dispersed in water. However, the superiority of L-PZQ ODT over Rac-PZQ ODT without water could not be confirmed. L-PZQ ODT dispersed in water was more palatable than Rac-PZQ ODT dispersed in water for boys but not for girls. Some evidence of an age effect and gender effect on palatability was also observed.The trial was a randomized, single-blind, five-period crossover clinical trial designed to evaluate the palatability of the two new ODT formulations of PZQ and the currently available PZQ tablet. The study was carried out in a single school in Rufiji district, Tanzania, where schistosomiasis is endemic. Children aged 6-11 years were recruited and stratified by age group and gender. Each participant tasted each preparation only once in each of the five periods, with 2 hours between each assessment.The primary outcome was the difference in VAS score taken at 0 minutes immediately after spitting out (VASt = 0) for L-PZQ ODT disintegrated in the mouth without water versus Rac-PZQ ODT disintegrated in the mouth without water on Day 1. The secondary outcome was the difference in VAS score taken at 0 minutes immediately after spitting out (VASt = 0) for L-PZQ ODT (150 mg) dispersed in water or Rac-PZQ ODT (150 mg) dispersed in water versus the current PZQ-Cesol tablet (150 mg, 1/4 of a 600 mg tablet) crushed and dispersed in water on Day 2. Other secondary outcomes included the VAS scores taken at 2 to 5 minutes (VASt2–5) after spitting out the IMP on Day 1 and Day 2, as well as the recording of any discomfort or other observations throughout the study duration.The study was designed to provide at least 89.2% power to detect a mean difference in palatability of 10 points in VAS score between Rac-PZQ ODT and L-PZQ ODT without water, assuming a within-subject standard deviation of 15 points and a two-sided Type 1 error of 5.0%. Similarly, it was designed to provide at least 89.5% power to detect a mean difference in palatability of 11 points in VAS score between one of the new formulations and the current PZQ formulation crushed in water, assuming a within-subject standard deviation of 15 points and a two-sided Type 1 error of 2.5%.The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ifakara Health Institute review board, the National Medical Research Council Committee, and the ethical committee of North-Western and Central Switzerland. The trial protocol and medicinal products were approved by the Tanzanian food and drug authority. The data safety monitoring committee was established by the sponsor.Children and their parents were informed about the trial through community-based meetings and written consent forms were obtained from all parents and children. Eligible participants were enrolled in one of the four stratification groups and then randomized to one of the 12 sequences. Participants were instructed to hold an investigational medicinal product (IMP) for 10 seconds in the mouth and then spit it out immediately. All recruited children were able to hold the IMP for 10 seconds without swallowing or spitting out before 10 seconds as instructed.The study was carried out within the school premises during weekends in April and May 2015. The IMP was prepared by a pharmacist in a separate room,
 This study discovered a novel mechanism of action (MOA) and specific compounds to treat all nine human herpesviruses and animal herpesviruses by targeting the pressurized genome state in a viral capsid and "turning off" capsid pressure, preventing viral genome ejection into a cell nucleus and viral replication. The MOA serves as a proof-of-concept for a new antiviral target that is likely impervious to drug resistance. The findings present a platform for the development of a new class of broad-spectrum treatments for herpesviruses and other viral infections with genome-pressure-dependent replication. The biophysical approach to antiviral treatment is also a vital strategy to prevent the spread of emerging viruses where vaccine development is challenged by high mutation rates or other evasion mechanisms.Herpesviruses are a leading cause of human viral disease, second only to influenza and cold viruses. Among the nine human herpesviruses, latent herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) frequently reactivate to result in recurrent acute oral and genital lesions, as well as encephalitis. Other herpesviruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can reactivate decades after the initial infection and may result in painful and debilitating recurrences of shingles. Infections with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are associated with oncogenic transformation. There is a large unmet need for anti-herpes drugs that can reduce the frequency and severity of recurring outbreaks and control viral replication in the immunocompromised.Currently approved herpetic antiviral agents target and disrupt multiple aspects of the viral life cycle, except for DNA release into the cell nucleus. Resistance can quickly evolve from even a single amino acid substitution in the targeted protein, which has been the scourge of most antiviral therapeutics. This has led researchers to search for antiviral targets that do not involve viral proteins. In this work, researchers discovered that the mechanically stressed and pressurized state of strongly confined viral DNA packaged in a herpesvirus capsid presents an evolutionarily static target for antiviral therapies that is independent of nucleotide sequences.The study used a reconstituted isolated nucleus system to demonstrate that the compounds prevent pressure-driven DNA ejection during the herpesvirus infectious cycle. The compounds are small polyamine molecules that permeate the viral capsid and bind to intracapsid DNA, condensing the packaged genome and removing capsid genome pressure. The compounds are polyamines that have been previously shown to strongly condense dsDNA. The condensation of DNA in a herpes capsid occurs through screening of DNA-DNA net repulsive interactions and introduction of net attractive interactions between the neighboring DNA strands, acting as an electrostatic and steric DNA-DNA “zipper.” The selected compounds have low cytotoxicity, making them promising lead compounds for further anti-herpes drug development and presenting a new class of broad-spectrum treatments for all nine human herpesviruses as well as animal herpesviruses.
 The Nancowry Islands in the Nicobar district of India, with a population of 7674, are the sole focus of diurnally sub-periodic Wuchereria bancrofti (DspWB) transmission by Aedes niveus mosquitoes. Despite nine rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) with DEC and albendazole, microfilaria (Mf) prevalence remained above 1%, indicating continued transmission. Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) was conducted to assess the impact of MDA and identify appropriate vector sampling methods.BioGents Sentinel traps, gravid traps, and human baited double bed net traps were used to collect Aedes niveus female mosquitoes. Subsequently, daytime man landing collections (MLCs) were carried out in all 25 villages. The average prevalence of W. bancrofti DNA in Ae. niveus was 0.43%, and the estimated upper 95% CI exceeded the provisional prevalence threshold of 0.1% in all villages, indicating continued transmission. MLCs were the most productive method for collecting Ae. niveus mosquitoes.MX, which includes vector mosquito collection and molecular assay, can be used to evaluate interventions in this area after further standardization of the protocol. The vector-parasite MX can be used to observe the impact of MDA on LF transmission. The PCR assay used in MX for nocturnally periodic bancroftian filariasis can be adopted for DspWB. However, the lack of parallel data on vector infection assessed by dissection and microscopy limits the ability to comment on false positives. The cheaper DNA extraction method used in this study should be technically and operationally feasible.MX has been observed to be an indicator of human filarial infection transmitted by different mosquito vectors in various ecological situations. In American Samoa, MX results showed evidence of ongoing transmission of W. bancrofti by Ae. polynesiensis after two successful TASs, which was confirmed by TAS3. In view of the ongoing transmission, MDA was continued in Nicobar district, including the four Islands, with additional inputs as per the national accelerated plan of LF elimination. A pilot study with mass distribution of DEC fortified salt as a supplementary measure to the ongoing MDA was implemented in two islands, and after one year of intervention, total interruption of transmission was achieved. MX can be a useful supplementary surveillance tool to TAS for evaluation of the impact as well as post-MDA monitoring. Exploring an alternative method of mosquito sampling to MLC will make MX operationally more feasible.
 This study discovered that USP12, a deubiquitinase, interacts with and inhibits the acetyltransferase activity of CBP, a critical regulator of transcription events through protein acetylation. USP12 positively regulates interferon (IFN) antiviral signaling independently of its deubiquitinase activity. In IFN signaling, USP12 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which facilitates CBP-induced acetylation and activation of IFN signaling proteins in the cytoplasm and blocks CBP-induced acetylation of phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1) in the nucleus, maintaining nuclear p-STAT1 levels and IFN antiviral efficacy. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of CBP acetyltransferase activity and potential strategies for improving IFN-based antiviral therapy.
 This study identified the presence of two orthobunyaviruses, Melao virus (MELV) and Oropouche virus (OROV), in plasma specimens from Haitian children with acute febrile illness during outbreaks caused by alpha- and flaviviruses in 2014. MELV was isolated from five case patients and was previously not known to cause human illness. OROV RNA was detected in one additional child. Abdominal pain was reported in four case patients with MELV infections, with lymphadenopathy noted in two cases. The findings highlight the importance of surveillance and viral genome sequence analyses to identify outbreaks caused by emerging viruses within the Caribbean region.Orthobunyaviruses are enveloped viruses with a genome composed of three segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNAs. MELV was first isolated from Aedes and Psorophora spp. mosquitoes in Trinidad and has been reported to cause infections leading to antibody production in horses and humans. OROV causes Oropouche febrile illness, which is a common arbovirus-associated febrile illness in Brazil, and is known to cause meningoencephalitis.Plasma samples were collected from children with acute febrile illness in a school cohort in Haiti and were screened for CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV, and malaria parasites using RT-PCR and rapid diagnostic tests, respectively. Virus isolation attempts were made in two cell lines, and vRNA was extracted and sequenced from cell culture media using a duplex RT-PCR for other alphaviruses and flaviviruses.The isolates were deemed safe to work with in a BSL2 facility and were transferred for further analysis. Two approaches were used to attempt to determine the genome sequences of the virus isolates: Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results showed that MELV was present in five of the 25 plasma samples, and OROV was present in one of the samples. The isolates were designated Haiti-1/2014 for MELV and Oropouche virus/Homo sapiens/Haiti-1/2014 for OROV.The findings document the occurrence and spread of these orthobunyaviruses within the Caribbean region and highlight the critical importance of surveillance (with unbiased sequencing approaches) to identify outbreaks/epidemics caused by these and other emerging viruses. The study also emphasizes the need for further research to understand the human pathogenic potential of these viruses and to develop diagnostic tools for their identification.
 The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had significant impacts on global health and economies. Spike protein, a major target for COVID-19 vaccines, is the dominant antigen that induces neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation was developed and tested in hamsters. The results showed that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2, but only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. The immune responses were biased toward Th1, and pSARS2-S immunization in hamsters could induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. These findings suggest that DNA vaccination could be a promising approach for protecting against COVID-19. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the NHRI and conducted in a BSL-3 laboratory. The DNA sequences encoding the full-length SARS-Spike and SARS-CoV-2 spike genes were optimized for mouse codon usage and synthesized. Different fragments of S were constructed and amplified individually by PCR and subcloned into the clinically used vector pVAX1. The plasmids were transformed into DH5α E. coli for plasmid amplification and extracted and purified using an endotoxin-free Qiagen column system. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated DNA plasmids using PolyJet reagent, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. BALB/c, C57BL/6 mice, and Syrian hamsters were used for immunization and challenge studies. The data showed that pSARS2-S immunization induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and protected hamsters from body weight loss and viral load reduction after challenge. The study also investigated the immunogenicity of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the ability of serum antibodies to interfere with the ACE2-RBD interaction. The results suggested that pSARS2-S immunization could induce competitive antibodies that efficiently block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to the ACE2 receptor. The study also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different vaccine platforms and the importance of further studies to investigate the efficacy of the DNA vaccine delivered using intradermal injection and in aged mice. The study concluded that the COVID-19 DNA vaccine may play a major role in controlling the pandemic in the near future.
 This study explores health beliefs and health seeking behavior towards Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP) services for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Luangwa District, Zambia. LF is a neglected tropical disease causing permanent disability through chronic manifestations of lymphedema, elephantiasis, and hydrocele. While MDA programs have delivered over 8.2 billion treatments to people in endemic areas since 2000, fewer LF patients have accessed MMDP services.The study was conducted through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with community members, including LF patients, community health workers, and healthcare providers. Participants identified various causes of LF, including contact with animal faeces, use of traditional herbal aphrodisiacs, witchcraft, and sexual contact with menstruating or miscarrying women. LF patients often visited traditional healers before seeking care from health facilities. Hydrocele patients were afraid of hydrocelectomies due to perceived infertility or death. Few community members were aware of home and facility-based care strategies for lymphedema.Barriers to seeking healthcare included long distances to health facilities, lack of awareness of existing MMDP services, perceived costs, gender and social norms, and fear of stigmatization. Health seeking behavior for LF in the district was driven by negative beliefs about the causes of the disease and lack of awareness of available MMDP services and homecare strategies.To improve access to MMDP services, strategies should empower patients and community members with information, promote awareness of existing services, and address cultural beliefs. Health education campaigns should address patients' concerns, create awareness of free-of-charge MMDP services, and strengthen referral systems. MMDP programs should also embrace strategies that motivate and empower LF patients and their families to overcome health systems and cultural barriers to accessing care.
 In this study, researchers identified vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) as a novel interaction partner of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) accessory protein p8. VASP is crucial for the transfer of p8 to other cells and also plays a role in the transfer of the HTLV-1 Gag protein between cells, potentially contributing to HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission. The researchers used bioinformatics analysis to predict the interaction between p8 and the EVH1 domain of VASP, which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence in different cell types. The VASP:p8 interaction was also shown to be specific, as it was detected in the presence of the detergent N-octyl-β-D-glucoside, which solubilizes membrane proteins. Mutational studies revealed that the EVH1 domain of VASP is necessary but not sufficient for the interaction with p8, and both the EVH1 and EVH2 domains of VASP are required for VASP localization to focal adhesions, which may be a prerequisite for the interaction with p8. The G- and F-actin binding domains located in the EVH2 domain of VASP are also required for the interaction with p8, suggesting that actin may be involved in the VASP:p8 interaction. The researchers also found that repression of VASP leads to a significant reduction of HTLV-1 Gag transfer between cells, suggesting that HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission depends on VASP. However, the mechanism of VASP-dependent Gag transfer remains to be elucidated. Overall, this study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of p8 transport between cells and uncovers VASP as a potential target to counteract HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission.
 This study explores the emergence of tinnitus-like "hallucinations" in a recurrent neural network trained using the entropy maximization (EM) approach. For typical inputs, the network developed connectivity patterns and exhibited output responses similar to biological findings regarding the auditory system, specifically the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). However, sensory deprivation elicited tinnitus-like hallucinations in the network, which resembled the characteristics of common types of tinnitus. The results suggest that the emergence of tinnitus depends on the interplay between the computational objective and the homeostatic regularization, in contrast to models driven by a single phenomenological homeostatic mechanism. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying other types of phantom sensations.The researchers trained a recurrent neural network using the EM approach to represent simulated auditory stimuli. For typical inputs, the network developed connectivity patterns and exhibited output responses similar to biological findings regarding the auditory system and the DCN. However, when the network was subjected to sensory deprivation by attenuating a part of the frequency domain, it exhibited tinnitus-like hallucinations. The results suggest that the emergence of tinnitus depends on the interplay between the computational objective and the homeostatic regularization, rather than a single phenomenological homeostatic mechanism.The study also discusses the implications of these findings for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying other types of phantom sensations. The researchers note that the findings are independent of the input modality and can be used to explain how other kinds of phantom sensations are caused by neural plasticity and involve the specific region in the sensory input space which was deprived of input. The DCN is known to receive various non-auditory inputs, including somatosensory projections, which are known to be upregulated in tinnitus and modulate the perceived tinnitus. The study suggests that the proposed computational framework can naturally account for the effect of non-auditory projections on the perceived tinnitus.The researchers also note that the emergence of tinnitus is likely to rely on changes in recurrent circuitry, although it may also involve additional changes in feed-forward interactions. They suggest that future work can generalize the current model to also include different non-auditory inputs and model their effect on the perceived tinnitus.In summary, this study demonstrates how the EM approach can be used as a model of early auditory processing and the phenomenon of tinnitus. The findings suggest that the emergence of tinnitus depends on the interplay between the computational objective and the homeostatic regularization, rather than a single phenomenological homeostatic mechanism. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying other types of phantom sensations and the role of non-auditory inputs in the perception of tinnitus.
 Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a neurotropic coronavirus belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus that primarily infects pigs through respiratory droplets and close contact, leading to neurological manifestations. The neuroinvasion route of PHEV is poorly understood, but it is known to target neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and cause significant smell and taste dysfunction. In this study, BALB/c mice were found to be susceptible to intranasal PHEV infection, and the behavioral and histopathological examinations revealed that PHEV attacks neurons in the CNS and causes olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. The virus was found to invade the CNS via the olfactory nerve and trigeminal nerve located in the nasal cavity, and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) were susceptible to viral infection. Immunofluorescence staining and ultrastructural observations suggested that axonal transport may engage in rapid viral transmission in the CNS. Moreover, viral replication in the olfactory system and CNS is associated with inflammatory and immune responses, tissue disorganization, and dysfunction. Overall, PHEV may serve as a potential prototype for elucidating the pathogenesis of coronavirus-associated neurological complications and olfactory and taste disorders.
 The regulation of glycometabolism homeostasis is crucial for animal and human health and development. The molecular mechanisms by which organisms regulate glucose metabolism homeostasis from a feeding state to a non-feeding state are not fully understood. Using the holometabolous lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera as a model, researchers revealed that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) upregulated the expression of transcription factor Krüppel-like factor (Klf15) to promote macroautophagy/autophagy, apoptosis, and gluconeogenesis during metamorphosis. 20E, via its nuclear receptor EcR, upregulated Klf15 transcription in the fat body during metamorphosis. Knockdown of Klf15 using RNA interference delayed pupation and repressed autophagy and apoptosis of larval fat body during metamorphosis. KLF15 promoted autophagic flux and transited to apoptosis. KLF15 bound to the KLF binding site (KLF bs) in the promoter of Atg8 to upregulate Atg8 expression. Knockdown Atg8 reduced free fatty acids (FFAs), glycerol, free amino acids (FAAs), and glucose levels. However, knockdown of Klf15 accumulated FFAs, glycerol, and FAAs.Glycolysis was switched to gluconeogenesis, trehalose and glycogen synthesis were changed to degradation during metamorphosis, which were accompanied by the variation of the related genes' expression. KLF15 upregulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) expression by binding to KLF bs in the Pepck promoter for gluconeogenesis, which utilized FFAs, glycerol, and FAAs directly or indirectly to increase glucose in the hemolymph.In summary, 20E, via KLF15, integrated autophagy and gluconeogenesis by promoting autophagy-related and gluconeogenesis-related genes' expression. Autophagy and apoptosis supplied substrates for gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis was changed to gluconeogenesis from feeding to non-feeding during metamorphosis. The elevation of hemolymph glucose levels was the result of blocking of glycolysis, enhancing of degradation of glycogen and trehalose, and increased gluconeogenesis.
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has prompted the scientific community to identify potential vaccine targets. The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates viral entry into host cells. To identify possible antibody binding sites, a 10 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted on a full-length atomistic model of four S trimers in the prefusion conformation. The model included the transmembrane domain (TMD) embedded in a complex lipid bilayer, along with realistic post-translational modification patterns, such as glycosylation of the ectodomain and palmitoylation of the TMD. The simulations revealed that the glycan shield, while extensive, does not hinder antibody accessibility as much as expected due to its flexibility. The study identified epitope candidates on the S protein by combining information on steric accessibility, structural flexibility, sequence conservation, and epitope characteristics. Nine distinct epitope sites were predicted, and five of these overlapped with experimentally characterized epitopes. The findings suggest that a fragment-based epitope presentation approach could be used to engineer stable immunogenic constructs that robustly elicit the production of antibodies. The methodology used in this study is general and can be extended to predict epitopes for other viral proteins.
 This study investigated the effects of type I interferon (IFN) treatment on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. The researchers observed that early administration of IFN, either one day before or one day after infection, protected against weight loss and decreased viral lung titers. However, IFN treatment initiated at the onset of symptoms three days post-infection had no impact on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study provides evidence that early type I IFN treatment is beneficial, while late interventions are ineffective. The researchers suggest that the timing of type I IFN treatment may be critical for its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and that further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this observation. The study was conducted in accordance with European Parliament and council regulations on animal use in scientific research.
 This study aimed to evaluate the use of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the identification of freshwater snail species involved in schistosomiasis transmission, using protein extracts from both frozen and ethanol-stored snails. The study used a total of 619 snail specimens, including 530 field-collected and 89 laboratory-reared specimens. The results showed that MALDI-TOF MS spectra obtained from the snail foot, head, and foot-head protein extracts were adequate to accurately identify freshwater snails. The optimized protocol was validated using only the foot, as it is the primary site for Schistosoma infection and a good protein source. The findings showed that MALDI-TOF MS spectra obtained from the snail foot, head, and foot-head protein extracts were adequate to accurately identify freshwater snails. The protocol validation was confirmed using only the foot. The study also showed that the use of ethanol for snail preservation did not affect the quality of the MS spectra, as long as the ethanol was properly removed before analysis. The database created using MALDI-Biotyper 3.0 and upgraded with MS spectra of high-quality, unambiguously identified specimens, showed 100% correct identification of six species in a blind test. However, there were not enough C. bulimoides specimens available for a blind test, and its identification was only confirmed morphologically. The study concluded that MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable tool for the identification of different frozen snail species and can be used to circumvent molecular limitations such as long sample preparation time, high-cost reagents, and the lack of reference data. The study also demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS can be used for the identification of snails stored in alcohol, but that requires the creation of a specific database with a large number of specimens preserved in ethanol to circumvent the bias of heterogeneity.
 This study describes the development and optimization of a smartphone microscope system for the detection and quantification of Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo) cysts in vegetable and water samples. The system uses a ball lens of 1 mm diameter, white LED illumination, and Lugol's iodine staining to provide magnification and contrast capable of distinguishing (oo) cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The analytical performance of the method was tested through spike recovery experiments, which resulted in comparable recovery percentages to those obtained using commercial brightfield and fluorescence microscope methods. The smartphone microscope system was then used to screen 7 types of vegetable and 18 water samples, revealing that 42% of vegetable and 33% of water samples were contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocysts, and 31% of vegetable and 30% of water samples were contaminated with Giardia cysts. The new method can be a low-cost and easy-to-implement alternative for simultaneous detection of (oo) cysts in vegetable and water samples in resource-limited settings. The approximate cost of the microscope (excluding the cost of the smartphone) is around $15. The future work involves the development of an automated smartphone program that could take images, process the images to identify and count the (oo) cysts, and provide reports to the user. This automated system may minimize errors and shorten analysis time. Overall, the smartphone microscope system offers a promising solution for rapid and affordable detection and quantification of (oo) cysts in various samples.
 Echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by larval stages of cestodes belonging to the genus Echinococcus, with two forms, cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), affecting humans in China. The disease is a major public health burden in western China, particularly in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where both CE and AE are prevalent. In 2018, a total of 47,278 cases of human echinococcosis were recorded in 370 endemic counties, with a prevalence rate of 10.57 per 10,000 people. Spatial autocorrelation and spatial scan statistics were used to analyze the distribution and prevalence of human echinococcosis in each county.The results showed that the spatial distribution of human echinococcosis in China displays a non-random spatial clustering pattern, with "hot spots" concentrated in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, mainly in northern Tibet, southwestern Qinghai, and Ganzi, and Sichuan. The transmission of E. granulosus senso lato occurs between dogs and livestock, while E. multilocularis transmission occurs between stray dogs or foxes as definitive hosts and rodents as intermediate hosts. Humans are aberrant intermediate hosts and are infected by ingesting E. multilocularis eggs.The study also identified several risk factors for human CE and AE in Tibetan communities, including the involvement of wildlife in E. multilocularis transmission cycle, unrestricted disposal of animal viscera, and the presence of large numbers of stray dogs. Prevention and control measures, such as strengthening the control of stray dogs in epidemic areas of AE, carrying out control measures of intermediate host animal density, monitoring the infection status, health education, and people awareness, should be considered.The findings of this study provide a basis for preventive actions and management policy to reduce the impact of human echinococcosis and improve its control in China. The study identified counties at high-risk of human echinococcosis and showed the presence of "hot spots" which need to be rationally addressed as a priority. Collectively, this study provides a basis for preventive actions and management policy to reduce the impact of human echinococcosis and improve its control in China.
 This paper investigates the effectiveness of different immunization strategies for controlling outbreaks in networks with missing data. The study compares degree, betweenness, and stochastic immunization strategies, specifically acquaintance immunization, under various levels of missing data. The results suggest that targeted immunization strategies, such as degree and betweenness, outperform random immunization even at high levels of missing data. However, stochastic strategies, like acquaintance immunization, become more effective than global strategies as missing data increases. The study also introduces a variant of acquaintance immunization that uses ongoing survey-intervention processes to improve data recovery and performance with increasing levels of missing data. The findings support the effectiveness of targeted immunization strategies and highlight the importance of considering the impact of missing data on network analysis and intervention strategies.
 Extracellular recording is a technique used to study brain physiology and pathology by measuring ionic currents and potential gradients in the extracellular space. The number of recording channels and their density have led to questions about the improvement brought by additional channels and optimal usage. This study demonstrates that for any given distribution of electrodes, there is exactly what information about current sources in the brain can be recovered and what information is strictly unobservable.The authors show that the current source density (CSD) can be recovered using the kernel Current Source Density (kCSD) method, which separates the estimation space from the experimental setup. They illustrate this using simplified examples and evoked potentials from the barrel cortex obtained with a Neuropixels probe and compatible model data. The results show that with careful consideration of the meaning of CSD and derivation of its relations to the potential, one can recover sources not accessible to standard methods.The authors explain that the extracellular potential is a consequence of ion motion driven by ionic currents and capacitive currents. The distribution of current sources is called CSD, and its relation to the potential is given by the Poisson equation. They demonstrate that with a conceptual separation of the estimation space from the experimental setup, one can recover sources not accessible to standard methods.The kCSD method is a two-step procedure that first estimates the potential using kernel interpolation and then moves the obtained solution to the CSD space. The authors introduce a large basis of CSD sources and corresponding basis sources in the potential space and construct their kernels from these basis sources. They show that the CSD and potential are represented as linear combinations of these basis sources.The authors also discuss the limitations of the metaphor brain model and the importance of source placement in the analysis. They illustrate the concepts using simulated and experimental examples of cortical responses to rat vibrissae stimulation and show how the analysis can be applied to data from modern probes such as Neuroseeker or Neuropixels. They conclude that the proposed decomposition is general and can be applied to other inverse problems.The experimental procedures followed the 2010/63/EU directive and were accepted by the 1st Warsaw Local Ethics Committee. An electrophysiological experiment was performed on an adult male Wistar rat using a Neuropixels probe inserted into the brain to study the somatosensory thalamus. The data was acquired from all 384 electrodes in bank 0, arranged on a four-column checkerboard configuration, and analyzed using offline filtering and downsampling.
 This study aimed to investigate the effects of co-infection on parasite density and gametocyte carriage for all possible combinations of the four major human Plasmodium species using molecular diagnostics. The study was conducted in Papua New Guinea, where all four Plasmodium species co-exist, and used a unique dataset of nucleic acid samples collected from the Albinama cohort study.The study found that the observed frequency of Pf-Pv co-infection for asexual parasites (14.7%) was higher than expected (11.3%), and the observed frequency of co-infection with Pf and Pv gametocytes (4.6%) was also higher than expected (3.7%). The excess risk of co-infection was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.67) for all parasites and 1.37 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.79) for gametocytes. The excess co-infection risk was partially attributable to malaria infections clustering in some villages. Pf-Pv-Pm triple infections were four times more frequent than expected by chance alone, which could not be fully explained by infections clustering in highly exposed individuals.The study also found that Pm density increased with any additional co-infection, with a significant 6.57-fold increase in Pm asexual parasite density when co-infected with Pf asexual parasites. In co-infection with Pm, the mean asexual and gametocyte densities of any other co-infecting species were reduced compared to those in single-species infections, although these effects were not statistically significant. These data suggest that Pm thrives on the cost of co-infections and outcompetes these.The study also found that Pm prevalence increased very slowly over time, consistent with a low force of infection combined with a long duration of infection. This is consistent with Pm causing chronic infections that can last for years. The Pm and Po gametocyte detection assays were designed based on the assumption of functional similarity because of sequence similarity to the highly expressed pfs25 orthologue, i.e., pms25 and pos25 show similar high expression to pfs25.The study had some limitations, including the use of blood for RNA extraction on filter paper and later storage in TRIzol for several years, which could have led to RNA degradation and underestimation or undetected gametocyte densities. Another limitation was the narrow age range of study participants, which may not be representative of the total population. The study did not analyze morbidity or account for individual-level heterogeneity in exposure, which could have reduced some of the remaining heterogeneity. The study also did not analyze the sub-species of P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri due to limited sample numbers. The analyses presented did not account for individual-level heterogeneity in exposure, which could have reduced some of the remaining heterogeneity. Overall, the study provides important insights into the complex interactions between Plasmodium species within the human host and highlights the need for further research to fully understand these interactions.
 IUSMMT is a novel statistical approach for examining high-dimensional mediation effects in survival models with multiple exposures and one mediator. It was applied to ten TCGA cancers to identify genes that likely exhibited mediation effects of gene expression on the signaling pathway from DNA methylation CpG sites to the survival risk of cancers. The results showed that only a few of DNA methylation CpG sites showed a total impact on the survival risk of cancers, but DNA methylation CpG sites can influence expression level directly for a wide range of genes, and most of these methylation-regulated genes were shared across distinct cancers. Many genes were related to the survival risk of cancers, but most of them were cancer type-specific, and the majority of the mediations associations were also cancer type-specific. Almost all the associations were full mediations, with only few partial mediations. However, it is important to note that the regulation assumption from DNA methylations to gene expression may not fully hold, and altered DNA methylation may simply represent a passenger event rather than a mediation event. To distinguish passenger methylation events from mediation methylation events, a reverse regression analysis was performed, which found statistically supportive evidence that a small fraction of mediation associations may be passenger methylation events. However, this reverse analysis strategy is an ad-hoc approach which has no clear theoretical basis and only considered the cis influence of gene expression regulation on methylation. IUSMMT may be sub-optimal if the effect sizes of DNA methylation CpG sites located within the gene have the same direction, and it may be desirable to construct a feasible omnibus mediation effect test that can aggregate all these strengths. The power in the first stage where the relationship between a set of DNA methylation CpG sites and gene expression level was examined with the variance-component test with a linear kernel function can be further enhanced by using other more complicated kernels or a composite optimal kernel. IUSMMT is freely available at https://github.com/biostatpzeng/IUSMMT.
 This study investigates the gene regulatory network controlling predatory and non-predatory mouth form development in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. The researchers found that the network consists of genes of different age classes, and identified mutants in the conserved nuclear hormone receptors nhr-1 and nhr-40 with previously unseen phenotypic effects. Nhr-1 mutants disrupt mouth-form determination and result in animals combining features of both wild-type morphs, while nhr-40 mutants display altered morph ratios but no intermediate morphology. Both NHR-1 and NHR-40 share transcriptional targets, which encode extracellular proteins with no orthologs in Caenorhabditis elegans and result from lineage-specific expansions. The major morphological changes in the pharyngeal gland cell, where these targets are expressed, are linked with the evolution of teeth and predation. This study enhances our understanding of the genetic basis of developmental plasticity and the evolution of novel traits.
 Mitochondria play a crucial role in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamics in cardiac myocytes through calcium exchange, ATP generation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Abnormal mitochondrial depolarization can lead to Ca2+ alternans, a phenomenon linked to cardiac arrhythmias. However, the complex signaling pathways and Ca2+ cycling between mitochondria and the cytosol make it challenging to investigate the underlying mechanisms of Ca2+ alternans under abnormal mitochondrial depolarization.In this study, researchers used a newly developed spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte computer model to investigate the mechanisms of Ca2+ alternans during mitochondrial depolarization. They found that elevated ROS in response to mitochondrial depolarization plays a critical role in promoting Ca2+ alternans. The redox effect of ROS on ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase synergistically promotes alternans. Upregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter promotes Ca2+ alternans via Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening.Oxidized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation and ATP do not play significant roles acutely in the genesis of Ca2+ alternans after mitochondrial depolarization but can be significant in the long term, mainly through their effects on sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity. In conclusion, mitochondrial depolarization promotes Ca2+ alternans acutely via the redox effect of ROS and chronically by ATP reduction, while suppressing Ca2+ alternans chronically through oxidized signaling, mainly via their effects on SERCA activity.
 This study investigates the spatiotemporal association between urbanization, distribution of water bodies, and the incidence of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in Xi’an City, China, from 2005 to 2018. The results revealed an overall clustered pattern of HFRS incidence across Xi’an, with most districts having high incidence located in the middle region and significant high-high clusters in the south-central region. The temporal distribution of HFRS incidence showed two peak periods: June–July and November–January, with a continually increasing and then decreasing trend in the number of cases from 2005 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018, respectively.Rapid urbanization significantly affected the HFRS incidence in two different time phases. In the first phase, urbanization increased the rate of HFRS infection, while in the second phase, which began six years after urbanization, the HFRS incidence gradually decreased to approach the average incidence rate of previously urbanized areas. This phenomenon was primarily attributed to the destruction of natural habitats and activity rules of animal reservoirs, leading to increased rodent host populations and densities, particularly in Zhouzhi, Huyi, Lantian, and Yanta districts.The distribution of water bodies was also found to be an important driver of HFRS incidence in Xi’an. Two significant thresholds of 696.15 m and 1575.39 m were observed, where the association of water bodies with the HFRS incidence rate in the surrounding areas peaked, especially at a distance of approximately 600 m away from the water bodies.The study used both traditional statistical and geospatial methods, including global and local autocorrelation, circular buffer analysis, and KDE analysis, to investigate the dynamic patterns, variations, and influential determinants of HFRS incidence. The findings may help in understanding how water-body distribution influences human exposure to rodents or their body fluids/excreta from a spatiotemporal perspective. The methods used in this research may also yield the same findings, suggesting that regions at approximately 600 m from the water bodies may have a high risk of Hantavirus infection and are almost unaffected by the sex or age of patients.The study has some limitations, including the lack of data on the complex mechanism of HFRS transmission, the difficulty of investigating the comprehensive relationships between urbanization, distribution of water bodies, rainfall, and vegetation on HFRS incidence from a spatiotemporal perspective, and the difficulty of determining the exact location where patients were infected due to limited information available from the acquired data.Despite these limitations, the study provides a practical example of how to apply geostatistical approaches to quantitatively explore the dynamic patterns, variations, and influential determinants of an epidemic, which not only demonstrates a potential way to address some research gaps in the existing literature but also presents several opportunities to support public health decision-makers in implementing effective strategies for preventing epidemics.
 Helicobacter pylori, a bacterial pathogen that chronically infects approximately half of the world's population, exhibits significant genetic diversity within and between individuals. In a study of a single individual's H. pylori isolates collected over a six-year period, researchers identified 1,767 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 485 indels across 39 isolates. The average genetic distance between isolates from the same time point was 6.75 x 10-5, while the average genetic distance between isolates from different time points was 8.23 x 10-4, indicating within-host evolution with an average molecular clock rate of 1.3 x 10-4 substitutions/site/year. Recent antral isolates had increased diversity compared to ancestral isolates, demonstrating accumulation of genetic diversity during chronic infection. Cell envelope genes, including outer membrane proteins (OMPs), accumulated a disproportionate number of nonsynonymous SNPs, suggesting a selective advantage in both the acute phase of infection as a mechanism of adaptation to a specific host and in the chronic phase of infection as a mechanism to persist in changing host environments. Recent isolates had 7 unique nSNPs in cagY and several nSNPs within the middle repeat region of cagY, which can undergo recombination resulting in expansion or contraction of repeats and attenuate or enhance Cag T4SS-dependent IL-8 secretion. All recent isolates and ancestral isolate SC4 shared the same RFLP pattern, but the SC4 cagY allele carried two unique nSNPs not found in any other isolates in the collection. The study also found that recent isolates within the same cell shape phenotype category were more genetically similar than recent isolates from different cell shape categories and that genetic divergence positively correlates with phenotypic divergence in wavenumber and size curvature per unit axis length, indicating a signature of selection for loss in helical shape within this sub-population of recent isolates. The findings suggest that subgroup differentiation within a population of isolates collected from a single time point may have phenotypic consequences for infection.
 Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infections, including Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Necator americanus, cause significant morbidity in children and women of reproductive age. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive chemotherapy (PC) using anthelminthic medicines to control STH infections in at-risk populations. Historically, STH have been intensively transmitted in Pemba Island, Zanzibar, with prevalence near 100% in 1994. PC was introduced in the island but was not regularly administered due to drug procurement difficulties. In 2011, a survey estimated a prevalence of STH of 89%, and PC was regularly administered until 2018. A 2021 survey found a prevalence of 80% (95% CI 78.1-81.5), with most infections due to Trichuris trichiura. Over 32% (95% CI 30.3-34.0) of children had infections of moderate or heavy intensity. PC has been conducted in Pemba for over 25 years, but despite its beneficial impact, the prevalence and intensity of STH infections remain high. This is likely due to a combination of irregular PC, climatic conditions favorable to STH transmission, the low sensitivity of T. trichiura to benzimidazoles, high population density, and poor sanitation. Improvement of sanitation coverage remains a key measure to permanently reduce the prevalence and intensity of STH. Possible changes to PC approaches in Pemba include assuring high coverage and compliance in all schools, using mebendazole instead of albendazole, and co-administering ivermectin with mebendazole.
 Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes millions of infections globally. CHIKV enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and undergoes membrane fusion primarily from Rab5-positive early endosomes. The intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry was examined, revealing two distinct patterns: half of the particles remained static during cell entry and predominantly fused in the cell periphery, while the other half showed fast-directed microtubule-dependent movement prior to delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells and impaired the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol, suggesting that microtubules may direct the particle to a cellular location beneficial for establishing infection or aid in nucleocapsid uncoating.
 Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is an essential nucleotide second messenger in many bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis. Its essentiality is due to its global impact on different aspects of cellular physiology, particularly in controlling potassium and osmolyte homeostasis. In B. subtilis, c-di-AMP binds to two signal transduction proteins, DarA and DarB, and several potassium, osmolyte, and magnesium transporters, as well as the riboswitch that controls the expression of high-affinity potassium transporters KtrAB and KimA.To gain further insights into the critical functions of c-di-AMP in B. subtilis, suppressor mutants were isolated from a c-di-AMP-free strain (GP2222) that had adapted to tolerate the presence of glutamate or to grow on complex medium. The suppressor analysis was complemented by a transcriptome analysis to understand the roles of glutamate and potassium as well as of c-di-AMP for global gene expression in B. subtilis.The results indicated that the adaptation to either glutamate or complex medium usually requires the simultaneous presence of multiple suppressor mutations that often affect potassium uptake, osmolyte uptake, or glutamate metabolism. Moreover, a mechanosensitive channel and phospholipid biosynthesis play an important role in the sensitivity of a strain lacking c-di-AMP to glutamate.The major glutamate transporter in B. subtilis was identified as the amino acid transporter YbeC (renamed AimA), which is the major serine transporter in the organism. The c-di-AMP-binding signal transduction proteins DarA and DarB seem to be toxic in the absence of c-di-AMP, and only in their absence could suppressor mutants be isolated.The obtained results shed light on the complexity of c-di-AMP essentiality and open new directions of research.
 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widely prevalent human herpesvirus that can cause lymphomas and epithelial cell cancers. In immunocompromised hosts, EBV can cause endemic Burkitt lymphoma and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphomas. EBV breaches cellular barriers to cell proliferation by preventing phosphorylation of Chk1, which suppresses the intra-S phase cell-cycle checkpoint and impairs homologous recombination repair (HR). This defect in HR makes EBV-transformed cells susceptible to PARP inhibition and reliance on error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) repair.Our study demonstrates that EBV-transformed cells with constitutively active STAT3, though deficient in HR, competently repair DSBs via MMEJ, rapidly accrue genome-wide scars from MMEJ-mediated deletions and insertions, and succumb to PARP inhibition. We also identified a STAT3-gene signature that predicts susceptibility of EBV-unrelated cancer cell lines, including blood cancer lines, to PARP inhibition. Our findings provide insights into the role of constitutively active STAT3 in HR impairment and BRCAness in EBV-transformed cells and open the possibility of personalizing synthetic lethal therapy for patients with STAT3hi cancers.We found that EBV-transformed cells utilize MMEJ to repair DSBs and rapidly accrue genome-wide scars from MMEJ-mediated deletions and insertions. These findings should apply to EBV-LPD, BL, and DLBCL harboring EBV in type III latency. The existence of MMEJ-signatures in pre-existing deletions and insertions in primary B cells hints at roles for MMEJ-mediated repair in physiologic contexts. Our findings indicate that EBV-lymphomas may be effectively treated with Olaparib, a strategy that has not been previously considered.We used primary antibodies for immunologic applications, including rabbit anti-human STAT3, rabbit anti-human pSTAT3 (Y705), mouse anti-human RAD51, rabbit anti-human pATR (S428), mouse anti-human β-actin, rat anti- (EBV) EBNA2 (clone R3), HRP-anti-mouse Ab, HRP-anti-rabbit Ab, FITC-anti-mouse IgG, PE-anti-rabbit IgG, and PE-anti-rat IgG. We assessed cell-cycle distribution using anti-EBNA2 antibody and propidium iodide, and performed DR-GFP and EJ2-GFP assays. Data were acquired using a FACS Calibur and analyzed using FlowJo software. Cells were stained as for flow cytometry, washed, cytospun onto glass slides, air dried, and mounted with DAPI Prolong Gold Anti-fade. Images were acquired at 40× magnification on an AxioScope A1 microscope with SPOT v4.0 software. When counting cells with nuclear foci, images were blinded and counted by two individuals; only nuclei with ≥5 foci were considered positive. Total extracts from 1x106 per mL cells were analyzed by immunoblotting. Plasmids DR-GFP, pCBASce (encoding I-Sce1 enzyme), and pCAGGS were gifts from Dr. Maria Jasin, and EJ2-GFP-puro was a gift from Dr. Jeremy Stark. Plasmids bearing wild-type and phosphorylation site Chk1 mutant S345A were gifts from Dr. Kum Kum Khanna. BL cells and EBV-LCL were transfected using an Amaxa II nucleofector with plasmids or siRNA. Sample sequencing was outsourced to BGI, who used a standard bioinformatics pipeline for indel detection. Custom R scripts were used to implement the analysis. Any indels previously identified by the 1000 genomes, ESP6500, or dbSNP141 were removed, as were any that were shared between the two human samples. For analysis of deletions with microhomology, the sequence adjacent to each deletion was extracted based on the human genome, and for analysis of "small" delet
 Buruli ulcer is a chronic, debilitating disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, which has been reported in over 33 countries, primarily in Africa, South America, and the Western Pacific. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimize morbidity, costs, and prevent long-term disability. The gold standard for clinical diagnostic confirmation is the quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the insertion sequence IS2404 of M. ulcerans in cutaneous samples. However, the confirmation rate of this test in endemic countries is low, with only around 30% in 2018. In response, 11 laboratories in 9 African countries formed the Buruli Ulcer Laboratories Network (BU-LABNET) in 2019 to harmonize procedures and improve diagnostic quality.The network compared and validated various DNA extraction and qPCR methods to ensure consistency and efficiency. The alkaline lysis procedure, which is known to be a robust, rapid, and inexpensive method, was chosen for DNA extraction from swabs and FNA samples. The HOT FIREPol Probe Universal qPCR Mix was selected as the standard qPCR master mix due to its stability at room temperature, cost-effectiveness, and guaranteed availability in Africa.The harmonized procedures were disseminated to all laboratories, and all 11 laboratories have since switched to the new DNA extraction and qPCR methods for routine diagnosis. The first EQA program round was completed by 10 participating laboratories, with 7 laboratories achieving 100% concordant results. The false negatives could be attributed to problems originating from the extraction procedure and/or pipetting techniques.The BU-LABNET aims to improve diagnostic performance, increase the qPCR confirmation rate, and eventually integrate other neglected tropical diseases, such as yaws, onto the molecular platform. The network's vision is to enhance the continued high performance of the network laboratories through onsite assessments, online troubleshooting, and mentoring. National programs and NGOs must invest in communication between hospitals and laboratories and ensure the delivery of samples becomes frequent and reliable. Laboratories have a maximum of 7 days to deliver results upon receipt of samples. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases diagnosed by the laboratories has significantly increased in 2021. The importance of testing for the bacillus before starting treatment is evident, as the PCR positivity rate of suspected cases is less than 50% in all laboratories.
 In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the mechanism of CD44 translocation in membranes, mediated by palmitoylations and the presence of PIP2 lipids. CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in connecting various cellular activities. Its translocation inside cell membranes is determined by the composition of membrane microenvironments and specific modifications on the TM proteins.The results of the simulations revealed a delicate balance between protein modifications and membrane composition that influences both the distribution of CD44 and its ability to bind the cytoskeletal adaptor FERM. CD44-WT prefers to reside in non-raft domains, while attachment of palmitoyl groups increases its raft affinity. In a plasma membrane model, CD44-WT accumulates PIP2 and unsaturated lipids in its vicinity, while the introduction of palmitoylations enhances its ability to sequester more saturated lipids. The co-localization of CD44 and the cytoskeleton adaptor is found to promote in invasive cancer cells, and it is speculated that the ERMs sequester CD44 in the non-raft domain to accelerate cellular migration. Palmitoylations can suppress the spread of tumor cells by keeping CD44 and the ERM adaptors in separate micro- or nano-domains of the membrane.The palmitoylation site at Cys-286 is located in the TM and thus buried in the membrane, while Cys-295 is located at the disordered CT. Cys-295 is likely to be easier palmitoylated by palmitoyl acetyltransferases that reside in the raft domain, which cannot be readily entered by the TM of CD44 without palmitoyl moieties. Furthermore, CD44 can form homodimers or dimers with other growth factors, and this contact can act as another barrier for the palmitoylation of the TM site.The association of CD44 and the FERM domain can be accelerated in the presence of multivalent PIP2 lipids. PIP2 allows FERM to bind to the surface of the membrane, which in turn enhances the binding affinity of the FERM to the membrane. Since PIP2 prefers to reside in the non-raft domain due to its unsaturated bonds in the sn-2 hydrocarbon tail, FERM will be localized at the non-raft domain as well. PIP2 lipids enable single palmitoylated CD44 to migrate to the non-raft domain, thus allowing CD44 and FERM to be co-localized. The change of the raft affinity is achieved by a clustering of PIP2 around the basic residues at the surface between CT and TM that effectively shields the moieties from interacting with the raft lipids.The clustering of PIP2 around CD44 allows the CT to stretch and detach from the membrane surface, thus allowing an easier binding to the FERM. The degree of palmitoylations of CD44 and the amount of PIP2 in the membrane critically depend on the binding of CD44 and FERM, like dimerization of several CD44 units, subsequent palmitoylations of CD44 via PAT, and depalmitoylations with corresponding enzymes. PIP2 clustering recruited by membrane proteins is often stable in CG simulations, and even small concentrations of PIP2 can greatly enhance the adsorption of FERM.The membrane type and the localization within the cell are of crucial importance, as raft domains cover typically only a small amount of the membrane surface, and PIP2 lipids are especially enriched in certain cellular junctions like lamellipodia of migrating cells. Therefore, there are several different pathways with which the binding of CD44 and the membrane adaptor can be regulated.The study revealed the competitive relationship of acylation modifications on the one hand and lipid-mediated regulation on the other hand at near-to-atomistic resolution. The information of the membrane translocation, structural transformation of CD44, and the binding to membrane adaptors, mediated by PIP2 and different palmitoylations, can significantly enhance our comprehension of membrane protein regulation pathways.
 Fire ant rafts are collective living systems that exhibit cooperative emergent functions, such as the ability to form tether-like protrusions that facilitate exploration and escape from flooded environments. These protrusions emerge spontaneously due to local interactions between ants, as demonstrated by an ant-inspired agent-based numerical model. The model consists of a structural layer of interconnected worker ants that floats on the water and gives ant rafts their form, and a dispersed layer of motile ants that walk on top of the floating network. Local interactions occur between neighboring free ants, and the persistence length of freely active agents is tuned to match experimental trajectories. The treadmilling of the raft occurs as agents transition between the structural and free layers. The model demonstrates that phases of exploratory protrusion growth may be induced by increased ant activity, as characterized by a dimensionless parameter A. These results provide an example of how functional morphogenesis of a living system may emerge purely from local interactions at the constituent length scale, and inspire the development of decentralized, autonomous active matter and swarm robotics.
 This study aimed to investigate the olfactory gene repertoires of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus (Cq) and Culex pipiens molestus (Cm), two subspecies of the Culex pipiens complex with distinct blood-feeding behaviors. The researchers conducted transcriptome sequencing on antennae of both subspecies before and after blood feeding, followed by bioinformatics analysis and qPCR validation. The results showed that 22,293 transcripts were obtained, with significant differences in gene expression between the two subspecies before and after blood feeding. Prior to blood feeding, 1,923 transcripts differed significantly between the two subspecies, while 3,979 transcripts differed after blood feeding. Among these, 123/51 transcripts had significantly higher/lower expression in Cq than in Cm, regardless of whether the mosquitoes had fed on blood.The researchers identified 640 upregulated and 1,382 downregulated transcripts expressed in both Cq and Cm. They also identified 5 and 7 Cq-specific and Cm-specific OBPs, respectively. The expression levels of some OBPs and ORs were significantly different between the two subspecies, suggesting their potential role in the blood-feeding behavior differences. For example, OR5 was expressed only in Cq, and OR65 was the only gene upregulated in Cm after blood feeding. The RNAi of OR5 and OR78 in Cq significantly inhibited its blood-feeding behavior, providing new targets for screening effective repellent compounds.The study also highlighted the importance of further research on the functional characterization of entire receptor repertoires to explain the relationships between certain odorants and receptors in guiding blood-feeding behaviors. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the differences in blood-feeding behaviors between Cq and Cm, and lays the foundation for the development of targeted interventions to control mosquito-borne diseases.
 The hippocampus encodes spatial information through place cells, which are formed and stabilized through a combination of somatic disinhibition, dendritic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity. During exploration of novel environments, place cells are rapidly formed and their firing rate increases, but they return to baseline levels in familiar environments. Place fields in familiar environments are more stable than in novel environments due to stronger excitatory synaptic weights and strong dendritic inhibition. The model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity. Silent cells can be transiently turned into place cells through a combination of somatic depolarization and dendritic inputs. The reduction in dendrite-targeting inhibition and increase in soma-targeting inhibition during exploration of novel environments open a window for plasticity, leading to the formation and stabilization of receptive fields. The model predicts that small induction areas and induction in novel environments are more effective at inducing place field shift. The increase in soma-targeting interneuron activity can also control plasticity at CA1 pyramidal neurons. The model provides several predictions that could be tested experimentally, such as the development of place fields in the absence of a novelty signal, the effect of the persistent sodium current on place field amplitude, and the efficiency of perturbation protocols to shift place field location. The model complements previous models by introducing interneuron diversity and the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory plasticity. The novelty signal could be responsible for the global emergence of place fields, while the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory plasticity could be responsible for their refinement. The model offers a possible mechanism for place field stabilization and highlights the importance of interneuron diversity and the balance between strong excitatory and inhibitory inputs for this stabilization.
 Molecular xenomonitoring (MX), the detection of Onchocerca volvulus DNA in Simulium spp. black fly vectors, is recommended for onchocerciasis surveillance in elimination settings. However, the sensitivity of MX for detecting onchocerciasis-positive communities and the relationship between MX rates and human microfilaria (mf) prevalence is poorly understood. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MX methods for characterizing the community burden of onchocerciasis. The primary objective was to assess the sensitivity of MX for detecting onchocerciasis-positive areas and explore the factors that affect this sensitivity. A secondary objective was to evaluate the relationship between mf prevalence and MX rates.Fifteen relevant studies were identified, with 13 studies comprising 34 study communities included in the quantitative analyses. Most communities were at advanced stages towards elimination and had no or extremely low human mf prevalence. MX detected positive flies in every study area with >1% mf prevalence, except for one study conducted in the Venezuelan Amazonian focus. A significant relationship was found between mf prevalence and MX rate, with mf prevalence accounting for half of the variation in MX rate (R2 0.50, p<0.001).MX is sensitive to communities with ongoing onchocerciasis transmission and has potential to predict human mf prevalence. However, further data is required to understand this relationship, particularly from MX surveys conducted earlier in control programmes before transmission has been interrupted. MX overcomes many of the challenges associated with parasitological and serological surveillance as it measures current infections and does not require invasive sampling. It may also become a valuable surveillance tool at earlier stages of control programmes.The sensitivity of MX for detecting onchocerciasis-positive communities is currently restricted by an inability to interpret MX results in the context of disease indicators that guide programme decisions. To expand the utility of MX, valuable information will come from control programmes that utilize MX methods earlier in their progress towards elimination. Data comparing MX surveys with concurrent parasitological surveys across a greater range of transmission levels would strengthen our certainty in the existing recommendations and help inform our interpretation of MX results for other programmatic goals. Collection of such data could be facilitated by control programmes utilizing MX methods earlier in the elimination pathway. Other areas for future research include improving the sustainability of MX, for example through the development of a sampling strategy that does not depend on human landing catches.
 This study investigates the association between MASP1 gene variants and susceptibility to leprosy and the different clinical forms of the disease. Leprosy patients presented lower MASP-3 and MAp44 levels compared to controls, and individuals with higher levels of these proteins were more frequent among controls and non-lepromatous patients. The results suggest that MASP-3 and MAp44 may play a role in the establishment of infections and in leprosy progression, and their availability in serum may be regulated by polymorphisms. The study also found associations between CR1 gene polymorphisms and leprosy and a negative correlation between anti-inflammatory soluble CR1 and pro-inflammatory MBL levels. All these associations were found with South Brazilian leprosy patients. The study provides a better understanding of the immunological clinical spectrum of leprosy and the role played by the lectin pathway in mycobacterial infections.
 Nongenetic phenotypic variation, specifically gene expression noise, can significantly impact the rate of adaptive evolution in bacteria. In environments where carbon and energy sources fluctuate, gene expression noise can accelerate the evolutionary process by decreasing population bottlenecks and increasing the fitness of a population. This is because noise can increase the probability that cells initiate growth on inferior carbon sources, reducing the severity of bottlenecks and increasing the mean population fitness. Additionally, gene expression noise can enhance the fitness effects of beneficial alleles by increasing their frequency and protecting them from extinction during bottlenecks. The principle of noise-enhanced adaptation applies to a broad range of environments and organisms, as fluctuating environments are common in nature.The model used in this study focuses on the evolution of the lag time that bacteria need to resume growth after a change in carbon source. The model assumes that cells can be in two states on acetate, one with high fbp and low pep concentrations, and the other with high pep and low fbp concentrations. The first state involves a low glycolytic flux, which results in a low Cra activity and a low probability of growth on acetate. The second state involves a high Cra activity, which promotes the intake of acetate and its conversion into pep, allowing for growth. The model predicts that greater gene expression noise can increase the fitness of a population in fluctuating environments, augment the fitness increase derived from beneficial mutations, and accelerate the rate of evolutionary adaptation to the new environment.In summary, nongenetic phenotypic variation, specifically gene expression noise, can significantly impact the rate of adaptive evolution in bacteria by decreasing population bottlenecks, increasing the fitness of a population, and enhancing the fitness effects of beneficial alleles in fluctuating environments. The findings from this study are not limited to bacteria but can be extended to other organisms experiencing periodic changes in their environment that are associated with a reduction in population size.
 Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), infect both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While much is known about virus-host interactions that regulate viral gene expression in mammalian hosts, less is understood about the interactions that involve inhibition, subversion, or avoidance strategies in the mosquito host. A novel RNA-Protein interaction detection assay, RaPID (RNA-Protein Interaction Detection), was used to identify mosquito proteins that form complexes with the DENV 3’UTR in mosquito cells. Two mosquito proteins, Sec61A1 and Loquacious (Loqs), were found to interact with DENV RNA and have pro-viral functions in the dengue viral infectious cycle.Sec61A1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein that is predicted to be a non-canonical RNA binding protein. It has been shown to inhibit DENV replication in both mammalian and mosquito cells. Loqs is a dsRNA-binding protein that interacts with the Dicer (Dcr) and Argonaute (Ago) proteins to regulate the RNAi pathway, a central immune defense mechanism in mosquito cells. Surprisingly, Loqs was also found to interact with the DENV genomic RNA and facilitate viral replication, independent of its role in the RNAi pathway.RaPID identified Sec61A1 and Loqs as high confidence hits that could potentially interact with the DENV 3’UTR in mosquito cells. Depletion of these proteins using RNA interference in Aag2 cells, a mosquito cell line, resulted in a significant reduction in DENV RNA abundances and viral titer. These findings suggest that both Sec61A1 and Loqs have pro-viral functions in DENV-infected mosquito cells.The RaPID approach also identified ATX2, a protein that displays 24% identity to human ATX2 and interacts with several DEAD box RNA helicases involved in RNA processing pathways both in mosquitos and humans. It was also recently shown to interact with ZIKV and WNV sfRNAs in mosquito cells. However, ATX2 was enriched with a slightly lower SAINT probability score in the experiments, and further investigation is needed to determine its role in DENV infection.In summary, the RaPID system was designed to identify proteins that interact with the DENV 3’UTR in mosquito cells. Two high confidence hits, Sec61A1 and Loqs, were identified as potential interactors. Depletion of these proteins using RNA interference resulted in a significant reduction in DENV RNA abundances and viral titer, suggesting that both Sec61A1 and Loqs have pro-viral functions in DENV-infected mosquito cells. Further investigation is needed to determine the roles of these proteins in the infectious cycles of other RNA viruses.
 This study investigates the impact of temporal environmental variations on community diversity in the context of competing populations. The researchers present a quantitative analysis of two-species and diverse communities, comparing scenarios with periodic and stochastic environmental variations and global or local competition dynamics. In two-species communities, stochastic variations yield shorter persistence times due to the ability to allow for rare sequences of bad years. In diverse communities, the actual number of temporal niches plays a crucial role, with larger numbers increasing both species richness and evenness under global competition and periodic variations. Surprisingly, when the number of temporal niches is small, global competition decreases species richness and evenness due to increased effective fitness differences. The study provides insights into the role of environmental variations in promoting taxonomic and genetic diversity.
 Functional non-coding RNAs (fncRNAs) are a diverse class of RNA molecules that play crucial roles in regulating gene expression, maintaining genome stability, and contributing to human health and disease. To understand the determinants of function in these molecules, researchers have sought to adapt the Evolutionary Trace (ET) paradigm, which has been extensively validated in protein research, to predict functional nucleotides in RNA from their evolutionary history.ET is a method that identifies functionally important residues in proteins by correlating sequence variations with evolutionary divergences. It makes two assumptions: that sequence variations during evolution are akin to sampling the sequence-function space via wet lab mutations, and that the depth of divergence between two sequences is commensurate with their functional difference. By systematically tallying the variations that track mostly with deep phylogenetic divergence, ET assigns a greater (or lesser) relative rank of evolutionary importance to each sequence position.In RNA research, ET has been shown to identify nucleotides of functional importance in multiple sequence alignments of homologous fncRNAs. For example, in the hammerhead ribozyme, ET nucleotides cluster with a mean z-score zc35% of 3.9 and overlap the catalytic core of the molecule. Similarly, in the bacterial ribosome, ET nucleotides broadly overlap major functional sites, such as the peptidyl-transferase center in 23S and the decoding center in 16S, with mean ET overlap z-scores zo35% of 3.9 and 0.91, respectively.ET also overlaps protein binding sites in the ribosome, with mean ET z-scores zo35% of 4.8 in the 16S rRNA and 9.2 in the 23S, and AUC values of 0.84 and 0.94, respectively. ET bases also overlap the critical structural bridges in the 23S, but not the 16S subunit, due to differences in the molecular basis of the bridge contacts.In summary, ET is a powerful tool for identifying functional nucleotides in RNA from their evolutionary history. It can be used to predict functional sites in RNA structures, reveal details on the basis of RNA molecular functions, and is currently available as part of the ET command-line package and as a web-server. The generalization of ET to RNA shows that evolutionary constraints among sequence, structure, and function are similar in structured RNA and proteins.
 This paper proposes a method for identifying the source of an epidemic outbreak using a multivariate Gaussian mixture model and a stochastic spatially-explicit epidemiological model. The source detection problem is recast as identifying the relevant mixture component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model, with parameters calibrated using a human mobility network and a stochastic epidemiological model. The approach is Bayesian, allowing for the incorporation of prior information and uncertainty quantification. The method is demonstrated to perform well in the context of the 2000-2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, outperforming the Gaussian mixture approach of Pinto et al. (2013) in simulation. The framework allows for the preliminary delineation of a roadmap to set up a surveillance network based on the proposed method in a country. The first step is to collect data on population distribution and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) conditions, followed by the setup of a spatially-explicit stochastic epidemiological model and simulations to calibrate the parameters of the probability distributions of first-arrival times. The approach is equivalent to standard linear discriminant analysis for K-dimensional classification, with pre-defined class weights. The HPD (Highest Posterior Density) region is used to obtain a set estimate for the source, which minimizes the volume of the area covered among all sets with at least 1 − α posterior mass. The mean and covariance parameters of each Gaussian component are calibrated using a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates human mobility network information. The stochastic epidemiological model for cholera transmission considers a set of human communities interconnected by a mobility network and describes the temporal evolution of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals hosted in the nodes, as well as the evolution of the environmental concentration of bacteria. The model treats events that involve human individuals as stochastic events, each occurring at a rate that depends on the state of the system. The force of infection is defined as the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected due to contact with contaminated water, and depends on the local concentration and the concentration in the surrounding communities, weighted by the probability of an individual traveling to the destination. Human mobility patterns are defined according to a gravity model, which defines the probability of an individual living in node i reaching the destination j based on the population size and the distance between the communities. The concentration is modeled as a stochastic variable in continuous time, based on the expectation of a large number of bacteria. The model allows for the generation of multiple Monte Carlo realizations of the outbreak, from which estimates of the mean and covariance parameters for the first-arrival times at the observers can be obtained. The approach is shown to perform well if the source has moderate or larger R0 and population, but decay in performance may be due to a lack of fit with the assumed multivariate Gaussian in the mixture model at the core of the framework. The use of more general mixture models or a mixture of epidemiological models may help, but integrating these models with an underlying epidemiological model is not immediately apparent. The proposed method may be viewed as a compromise that allows for increased interpretability and computational efficiency, blending statistical and mathematical modeling in the spirit of data assimilation techniques.
 Recent advances in multiplex imaging techniques have enabled the capture of extensive information from a single tissue sample using panels with dozens of markers. However, the limited space on these panels necessitates careful marker selection to avoid losing biologically relevant information while maximizing efficiency. In this study, we propose computational approaches to determine the shared information between markers and select an optimally reduced panel that captures the maximum amount of information with the fewest markers.We evaluated several panel selection methods, including correlation-based selection, sparse subspace-based selection, and gradient-based selection, using a breast cancer tissue microarray dataset with cyclic immunofluorescence staining as a proof of concept. The results showed that all methods performed adequately, allowing for the reconstruction of cell types using only 18 of 25 markers (72% of the original panel size). The correlation-based selection methods achieved the best single-cell marker mean intensity predictions, with a Spearman correlation of 0.90 between the reduced panel and the full panel.By using these methods, researchers can design more efficient multiplex imaging panels that maximize the amount of information retained while minimizing the number of markers, ultimately saving time, effort, and resources. Additionally, removing easily predicted markers from panels will allow researchers to introduce new markers that capture unique information not already conveyed by other markers on the panel.However, it is important to note that these methods require an initial round of staining to measure marker interactions and evaluate panel self-correlation. After an initial pilot panel, these optimally reduced panels can improve experiment time and expense by decreasing the number of staining rounds required. Future research could focus on designing panels for new datasets and patient samples without the need for retraining, as well as identifying which markers are consistently well predicted and which consistently fail regardless of panel reduction method.
 Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira interrogans, which can lead to acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in humans and animals. In this study, researchers used a hamster model to investigate the dynamics of leptospires and histopathological changes in the kidney during the acute and chronic phases of leptospirosis.The researchers infected hamsters with the Leptospira interrogans serovar Manilae strain UP-MMC-SM and observed that some hamsters developed fatal acute leptospirosis, while others recovered from the acute infection and became chronic carriers. The results showed that the increase in antibody titers during the acute phase was necessary for survival, and the distribution of leptospires in the kidney during the acute phase may have influenced the extent of tubular atrophy and CKD in the chronic phase.The researchers also found that the pathogenicity of the leptospires decreased as the storage period became longer, even in low-passaged strains. The kidneys of surviving hamsters showed no hemorrhage but some atrophy in the chronic phase. The distribution of leptospires in the renal interstitium during the acute phase was consistent with the lesions of tubular atrophy in the chronic phase, suggesting that tubular atrophy may occur in the presence of leptospires in the interstitial tissue.The researchers also measured serum creatinine levels in the surviving hamsters during the chronic phase to investigate the relationship between leptospirosis and the decline of renal function. The results showed that the serum creatinine levels of the surviving hamsters were significantly higher in the high tubular atrophy group compared to the low tubular atrophy group and the uninfected control group. The kidneys of hamsters infected with strains stored for two months or less showed higher atrophic tubules scores in the chronic phase compared to strains stored for 3, 4, and 7 months.The study also showed that the inflammatory response induced during acute infection, but not during chronic infection, plays a major role in Leptospira nephropathy in hamsters. The results suggest that the inflammatory response may be an important factor in influencing the outcome of leptospirosis.However, the study had some limitations, including the specificity of the results to the highly pathogenic serovar Manilae and the lack of data on normal serum creatinine levels in hamsters. Further studies are needed to understand the influence of long-term storage strains on infection and the effect of chronic renal colonization with Leptospira in susceptible animals. Overall, the study provides important insights into the dynamics of leptospires and the development of CKD in leptospirosis.
 Talaromycosis, caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei, is a serious and fatal disease endemic in Southeast Asia, particularly in China's Guangxi region. HIV-infected individuals are at high risk of developing talaromycosis, which has a significant in-hospital mortality rate. The factors influencing in-hospital death in HIV/AIDS patients with talaromycosis are not fully understood. Machine learning techniques can be used to develop a predictive model to identify relevant prognostic factors and reduce in-hospital mortality.A prospective study was conducted at the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning, Guangxi, from January 2012 to June 2019, enrolling 1927 HIV/AIDS patients with talaromycosis. The average in-hospital mortality rate was 13.3%. The most common complications/coinfections were pneumonia (68.9%), oral candida (47.5%), and tuberculosis (40.6%). Deceased patients showed higher CD4/CD8 ratios, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, creatinine levels, urea levels, uric acid (UA) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, total bilirubin levels, creatine kinase levels, white blood-cell counts (WBC), neutrophil counts, procaicltonin levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower CD3+ T-cell count, CD8+ T-cell count, and lymphocyte counts, platelet (PLT), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), hemoglobin (Hb) levels.The XGBoost machine learning model was developed and tested to predict the treatment outcome of hospitalized patients. The model exhibited good discrimination for the prediction of death during patient hospitalization, with a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 70% for both the training and test sets. The model showed no decrease in performance between the training data and test validation, indicating no overfitting. The SHAP value of each feature was used to describe the impact of features on the outcome. Septic shock and respiratory failure were the most important variables affecting death, along with serum uric acid, urea, platelet, and AST/ALT levels.The XGBoost predictive model offers relatively high accuracy in detecting the risk of in-hospital death in a population of 28.7% patients treated with current standard ART therapies during the study period. The results highlight the importance of respiratory failure, shock, urea levels, and platelet levels in predicting adverse outcomes, such as death. Further research is needed to clarify the significance of these indicators for death and correctly identify and predict the prognosis of patients.
 Toxocariasis, caused by Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati, is a neglected parasitic zoonosis and health disparity in the United States, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. A study in New York City found that Toxocara eggs were widespread in public spaces, with the highest contamination rate in the Bronx (66.7%) and the lowest in Manhattan (29.6%). Infective embryonated eggs were only found in the Bronx playgrounds, and T. cati was the predominant species. These findings suggest that feral or untreated cats in New York City are a significant source of environmental contamination. Human ingestion of embryonated eggs through contaminated soil or uncleaned vegetables can lead to paratenic zoonotic toxocariasis, which may result in cognitive and developmental delays, lung dysfunction, asthma, or covert infection. Toxocariasis is underdiagnosed and understudied, and more research is needed to understand its clinical spectrum and potential links to neurocognitive deficits and blindness in children. Preventive measures to reduce environmental contamination include improved fencing of play areas, deworming of domestic pets, better control of stray cats and dogs, picking up pet feces, avoiding consumption of contaminated food, restriction of children with pica from play areas, and frequent handwashing.
 This study investigates the medical significance of Tityus trivittatus populations from Paraguay and Argentina, focusing on their venom composition, antigenicity, and enzymatic activity. The results indicate that the Paraguayan population produces a potently toxic venom with an LD50 around 1.19 mg/kg, which is comparable to other Tityus species associated with lethal envenomations. Venom neutralization tests using Brazilian and Argentinean anti-Tityus antivenoms showed partial neutralization by the Argentinean antivenom, suggesting antigenic differences between the populations. SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed variations in venom proteins and unique peptides between the populations. A phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA COI data revealed a significant genetic divergence between the Paraguayan and Argentinean populations, suggesting they may represent distinct cryptic species. Overall, this study highlights the need for further research on the venom and taxonomic diversity of Tityus in southern South America.
 Bat-pollinated flowers have specialized echoic parts to attract pollinators in the absence of light. These parts act as acoustic retroreflectors, making the flowers acoustically conspicuous to bats. Bat-pollinated flowers from the Neotropics and one Southeast Asian species have been identified with acoustic adaptations. However, it is unclear if other bat-pollinated plant species also show such adaptations, or how their acoustic traits compare to other pollination syndromes.To investigate acoustic traits of bat-pollinated flowers, a dataset of 32,320 flower echoes was recorded from 168 individual flowers belonging to 12 different species, six of which were bat-pollinated and six were insect or hummingbird-pollinated. The spectral target strength of the flowers was analyzed, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on the spectrograms of the flower echoes. Results showed that bat-pollinated flowers have a significantly higher echo target strength, independent of their size, and differ in their morphology, specifically in the lower variance of their morphological features. The CNN achieved good classification accuracy with only one echo/spectrogram to classify the 12 different plant species, with bat-pollinated flowers being easier to classify due to their lower morphological variance.Bats use echolocation to navigate and find food, and nectar-feeding bats rely on echo information to locate flowers. Echo-acoustic information is particularly important for bat-pollinated flowers as they often have distinctive echoes that facilitate detection. However, it is unclear why not all bat-pollinated flowers have developed floral acoustic adaptations, or how their echo features compare to echo features of flowers belonging to other pollination syndromes.In this study, 168 flowers from six families and twelve species were collected and measured. For each family, a bat-pollinated and an insect or bird-pollinated species were chosen, and flowers were collected from multiple individuals to ensure variability. The flowers were measured using a biomimetic sonar head and a unit where objects could be fixed and rotated to ensonify them from different directions. The impulse responses from the flowers were obtained by deconvolution with the original MLS signal, and the spectral target strength was analyzed for five different frequency bands.The results showed that bat-pollinated flowers have a significantly lower coefficient of variation (cV) for the target strength of their echoes compared to insect- or bird-pollinated flowers. This suggests that a high morphological variance is directly related to higher acoustic variance, and the lower morphological variance of bat-pollinated flowers facilitates echo acoustic detection. The study also showed that the CNN achieved good classification accuracy with a small number of synthetic echoes, and that the architecture of the CNN was inspired by experiments on classification of plant appearance qualities for flower grading.In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the acoustic adaptations of bat-pollinated flowers and their importance for bat navigation and pollination. The results suggest that the lower morphological variance of bat-pollinated flowers is an acoustic adaptation that facilitates echo detection and classification, and that the use of a CNN for analyzing flower echoes is an effective approach for understanding the acoustic properties of different plant species. Further research is needed to fully understand the ecological significance of bat-pollinated flowers and their acoustic adaptations, and to explore the potential applications of echo-acoustic analysis in plant ecology and conservation.
 Schistosomiasis, caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma, is a significant health issue, particularly in China where Oncomelania hupensis is the intermediate snail host. Traditional methods for identifying snail habitats, such as manual collection, are resource-intensive and challenging in less accessible areas. To improve identification, a modelling strategy using machine-learning was employed in Anhui Province, a typical endemic area for schistosomiasis in China.Thirteen thousand snail distribution data points were collected from two types of habitats: lake/marshlands and hilly areas. Thirty-six environmental variables were included in the study, with most obtained from satellite imagery. Twelve machine-learning models were produced, including presence-only and presence-absence models. The random forest (RF) approach performed best, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.988 and 0.985 for lake/marshlands and hilly areas, respectively. The most important variables for predicting potential snail habitats were distance to the nearest river for lake/marshlands and mean temperature of the driest quarter and annual precipitation for hilly areas.The predicted high-risk areas for potential snail habitats of the lake/marshland type were mainly along the Yangtze River, while those of the hilly type were more dispersed and mostly distributed in the areas south of the Yangtze River. The precision maps of potential snail habitats should be valuable for directing local staff to conduct precise snail investigations, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of monitoring snail habitats, particularly when the climate varies from traditional.Machine-learning approaches are generally better than other methods for predicting potential snail habitats, with RF performing best among all the models investigated. The results presented here suggest that the same snail species may produce different outcomes in different living environments, but further research is needed to confirm this finding. Additionally, human factors and related issues, such as economy, population, urbanization, and environment reconstruction, should not be ignored when considering the distribution of O. hupensis. More flexible prediction models based on machine-learning algorithms are needed to meet the increasing need for accurate prediction and to identify potential snail habitats effectively.
 Giardia duodenalis, the causative agent of giardiasis, is a major intestinal parasitic disease in humans worldwide. The treatment of giardiasis relies mainly on metronidazole (MTZ) and albendazole (ABZ), with ABZ having fewer side effects and similar effectiveness to MTZ. ABZ is a broad-spectrum parasiticide that inhibits microtubule function by binding to monomeric and heterodimeric tubulin. In higher eukaryotes, ABZ is transformed into sulfoxide (ABZSO) and sulfone (ABZSOO) through the action of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). However, Giardia lacks both FMO and CYP, yet it carries out ABZ biotransformation into ABZSO and ABZSOO.The molecular mechanisms underlying ABZ resistance in Giardia are not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that ABZ resistance in helminths is associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the β-tubulin gene, which change the protein structure and alter its binding to ABZ. In contrast, recent studies have identified a different mutation (E198K) in β-tubulin in ABZ-resistant clones of Giardia trophozoites, suggesting that ABZ resistance in Giardia may have different mechanisms related to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the compound.In this context, a study aimed to identify the enzyme responsible for ABZ metabolism and its role in ABZ resistance in Giardia trophozoites. The study hypothesized that flavohemoglobin (gFlHb) promotes the conversion of ABZ to ABZSO, which is likely linked to an antioxidant, pharmacokinetic mechanism of resistance to ABZ in G. duodenalis.The study first determined that the iron-containing cofactor heme induces higher mRNA expression levels of flavohemoglobin (gFlHb) in Giardia trophozoites. Molecular docking analyses predicted favorable interactions of gFlHb with ABZ, ABZSO, and ABZSOO. Spectral analyses of recombinant gFlHb in the presence of ABZ, ABZSO, and ABZSOO showed high affinities for each of these compounds with Kd values of 22.7, 19.1, and 23.8 nM, respectively. ABZ and ABZSO enhanced gFlHb NADH oxidase activity, while LC-MS/MS analyses of the reaction products showed that gFlHb slowly oxygenates ABZ into ABZSO at a much lower rate. Furthermore, ABZ is indirectly oxidized to ABZSO by superoxide generated from the NADH oxidase activity of gFlHb.Interestingly, gFlHb mRNA expression is lower in albendazole-resistant clones compared to those that are sensitive to this drug. Moreover, all albendazole-resistant clones transfected to overexpress gFlHb displayed higher susceptibility to the drug than the parent clones. These findings indicate a role for gFlHb in ABZ conversion to its sulfoxide and that gFlHb down-regulation acts as a passive pharmacokinetic mechanism of resistance in this parasite.
 This study aimed to understand the biochemical basis of a paradoxical yeast growth phenotype, where met17Δ cells, which are auxotrophic for organosulfur compounds, can overcome this defect when inoculated at high cell density. The researchers discovered a previously overlooked sulfur fixation route, involving a protein named Hsu1p that allows cells to reincorporate sulfide ions that accumulate to growth-relevant concentrations in high-density cultures. Hsu1p substitutes for Met17p, catalyzing the incorporation of inorganic sulfide ions with O-acetylhomoserine (OAHS) to form homocysteine, thereby replenishing the central organosulfur pool and rescuing the met17Δ growth defect in a cell-cell cooperative manner. The data also suggest that the temperature dependency of the rescue may be due to the phase equilibrium towards formation of gaseous H2S, which is readily lost from the system at higher temperatures. The study also suggests that gaseous H2S could function as a chemical messenger or quorum sensing mechanism among cells in the culture. The findings were further supported by transcriptomic data showing that Hsu1p is induced during sulfur limitation and that the presence of Hsu1p and Met17p can confer a growth advantage under these conditions. However, how the cell regulates the activity of both homocysteine synthases to maintain growth without depleting their shared substrate pools remains to be studied.
 Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in insect vitellogenesis and egg production by stimulating the opening of the paracellular route for vitellogenin transport across the follicular epithelium barrier. During vitellogenesis, JH triggers Zonula adherens (ZA) disassembly at tricellular contacts, leading to patency dilatation. This process is essential for hemolymph yolk protein precursors to reach the oocyte membrane for subsequent VgR-mediated endocytosis.In the migratory locust Locusta migratoria, JH-induced patency occurs at the onset of vitellogenesis and correlates with increased JH titers. JH promotes aPKC and Par3 phosphorylation, which in turn mediates ZA disassembly at tricellular vertices for patency opening. The GPCR-Cdc42-Par6-aPKC signaling cascade is involved in JH-stimulated phosphorylation of aPKC and Par3, as well as ZA remodeling and patency enlargement.Using L. migratoria as a model system, researchers have reported that JH triggers Par3 phosphorylation via a signaling cascade including GPCR, Cdc42, Par6, and aPKC. Phosphorylated Par3 disassociates from β-Catenin (β-Cat), causing ZA disassembly at tricellular contacts and patency dilatation. While β-Cat is distributed at bicellular junctions, p-Par3 localizes at tricellular patency but not bicellular junctions.JH treatment leads to diminished β-Cat distribution at bicellular junctions along with enlarged opening of patency, while pretreatment of ACPD results in extended distribution of β-Cat at bicellular junctions and shrunk patency. These findings suggest that JH triggers Par3 phosphorylation via aPKC for ZA disassembly and patency induction.In summary, JH regulates ZA remodeling in the follicular epithelium for patency opening by activating the GPCR-Cdc42-Par6-aPKC signaling cascade, which in turn induces ZA disassembly at tricellular vertices for patency opening. This process is essential for hemolymph yolk protein precursors to reach the oocyte membrane for subsequent VgR-mediated endocytosis and egg production.
 Alcoholic-related liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver-related deaths, accounting for over 500,000 deaths annually worldwide. ALD includes conditions such as alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF) and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC), which can be reversible or irreversible, respectively. Unfortunately, most ALD patients are only diagnosed when complications from ALC occur. In this study, researchers used data from the Danish National Patient Registry to identify patients likely to develop ALF or ALC based on their past medical histories.The registry data was preprocessed to include only ICD-10 codes relevant for ALD and to remove irrelevant diagnoses. Three groups of ALD patients were identified: those with ALC only, those with ALF but not ALC, and those with ALF at least 6 months before ALC. The researchers then extracted 2-year upstream and downstream time windows of the first assignment date of ALC or ALF diagnosis for each group.Using machine learning algorithms, the researchers trained models on the ALC patients and achieved good performance on an independent test set. However, when testing the same models on the small number of patients diagnosed only with ALF, the performance dropped significantly. The study identified six groups of statistically significant upstream diagnoses related to liver dysfunction, alcohol overuse, malnutrition, trauma and injuries, upper intestinal mucosal, and other diagnoses. Downstream diagnoses of ALC included other sepsis and more diagnoses related to liver complication. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Danish Health Authority.
 In this study, researchers identified miR-87 as a critical regulator of dendrite regeneration in Drosophila using a non-biased miRNA screen. miR-87 KO C4da neurons fail to regenerate dendritic arbors, resulting in incomplete coverage of the adult epidermis. This defect can be ameliorated by expressing miR-87 in KO C4da neurons, indicating that miR-87 functions in a cell-autonomous manner to regulate dendrite regeneration. miR-87 is required for pruned dendrites to reinitiate the developmental program for dendrite outgrowth, as miR-87 mutant C4da neurons are defective in the initial elongation of dendritic branches. The researchers propose that upregulation of miR-87 is a critical determinant for dendrite regrowth, as forced expression of miR-87 in C4da neurons in the early larval stages causes precocious initiation of dendrite regeneration. miR-87 promotes dendrite regeneration by suppressing target gene expression in C4da neurons, with Ttk69 being a key functional target for miR-87 in dendrite regeneration. Overexpression of ttk69 in C4da neurons leads to dendrite regeneration defects, and both heterozygosity for ttk69 and RNAi knockdown of ttk69 significantly rescue the dendrite regeneration defects in miR-87 KO C4da neurons. miR-87 is required for dendrite regeneration after acute injury as well as during developmental remodeling. The findings suggest that the miR-87-mediated Ttk69 downregulation might be a core mechanism to reactivate dendrite regrowth in both developmental and injury-induced regeneration in C4da neurons. The observation that miR-87 activity is induced by dendrite damage raises significant questions about the control of miR-87 activity in sensory neurons and the mechanisms involved in damage sensing and signal transduction. The single-cell resolution provided by the miR-87 sensor should allow for systematic characterization of these mechanisms. The findings suggest that modulating miRNA activity in neurons might be a potential therapeutic strategy for promoting dendrite regeneration and functional repair after nervous system damage.
 This study investigates the functional role of CD16 on Vδ2 T cells in the immune response to malaria. Vδ2 T cells are innate-like effectors that can be rapidly activated during primary infection through their unique recognition of phosphoantigens produced by Plasmodium falciparum using the conserved transmembrane presenting molecules Butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) and Butyrophilin 2A1. However, chronic malaria exposure is associated with a decline in both the frequency and malaria-responsiveness of Vδ2 T cells, and the acquisition of an NK-like phenotype with CD16 expression. The study demonstrates that CD16+ Vδ2 T cells possess more cytolytic potential than their CD16- counterparts and bear many hallmarks of mature NK cells, including KIR expression. Furthermore, Vδ2 T cells from heavily malaria-exposed individuals are able to respond to opsonized P. falciparum-infected red blood cells through CD16, representing a second, distinct pathway by which Vδ2 T cells may contribute to anti-parasite effector functions. This response was independent of TCR engagement. Overall, these results expand the role for opsonizing antibodies in antimalarial immunity and highlight the importance of cooperation between the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system.
 DEER-PREdict is a software program designed to predict Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) distance distributions and Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) rates from ensembles of protein conformations. It uses an established rotamer library approach to describe paramagnetic probes and operates efficiently on large conformational ensembles, such as those generated by molecular dynamics simulation. The software has been tested against experimentally characterized protein systems, including HIV-1 protease, T4 Lysozyme, and Acyl-CoA-binding protein, and is open source (GPLv3) and available on GitHub and as a Python PyPI package.The software extends the Rotamer Library Approach (RLA) for DEER data from a protein ensemble and calculates PRE rates and intensity ratios using the same approach. It is implemented using the MDAnalysis package and is available on GitHub, PyPI, and Zenodo. The software can be extended to encompass non-protein biomolecules and additional rotamer libraries of paramagnetic groups, and can also be augmented with a module to predict Förster resonance energy transfer data.DEER and PRE measurements require an accurate treatment of the structure and conformational heterogeneity of the spin labels. DEER-PREdict achieves this using the RLA and, in the case of the PRE, a model-free approach to describe the dynamics. The software enables the prediction for multiple site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) experiments from a single simulation of the wild-type sequence, providing a significant advantage over simulations of explicitly spin-labeled mutants.
 This study evaluated the performance of a Rapid LAMP based Diagnostic Test (RLDT) for detection of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in stool samples from children under 5 in Zambia. The study included 324 participants, with an overall ETEC prevalence of about 19% using both RLDT and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The highest prevalence was observed in children between 12-59 months of age. The RLDT was found to be sufficiently sensitive and specific, with sensitivities and specificities for LT, STh, and STp toxin genes being 90.7%, 85.2%, and 100%, respectively, and specificities being 97.5%, 99.3%, and 99.7%, respectively. The results suggest that RLDT is an attractive tool for point-of-care testing in resource-limited settings due to its simplicity and rapidity. The study also described the prevalence and seasonality of ETEC infections in Zambia, with a seasonal trend of high positivity rates during the warm, rainy season. The RLDT performed comparably to qPCR, and the study justifies a broader application of the RLDT as a simple and rapid diagnostic test for ETEC in endemic countries. Limitations of the study include the cross-sectional design, the use of different sample preparation methods for RLDT and qPCR, and the lack of incidence data.
 Longitudinal intervention studies with repeated measurements over time are an essential type of experimental design in biomedical research, particularly in the context of "omics" sciences where multivariate outcome data are generated. Analyzing such data requires considering both the longitudinal intervention structure and multivariate nature. The ASCA+ framework, which combines general linear models with principal component analysis, has been used for separating and visualizing multivariate effects in longitudinal studies. However, it has limitations in handling more complex designs, such as unbalanced designs, randomized interventions, and substantial missing data.To address these limitations, a new methodology called repeated measures ASCA+ (RM-ASCA+) has been developed. RM-ASCA+ uses repeated measures linear mixed models in conjunction with ASCA+ to analyze longitudinal multivariate data with unbalanced designs and missing outcome data. This approach facilitates easier interpretation of data from longitudinal clinical trials with multivariate outcomes.The first step in RM-ASCA+ is to define an appropriate linear model for estimating the effects. Three commonly used types of longitudinal linear models, including repeated measures models, longitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and analysis of changes, were discussed. Repeated measures models were found to be the most suitable for analyzing such studies using ASCA+ or LiMM-PCA due to their ability to accommodate both randomized and non-randomized study designs and make full use of all available data.Two publicly available metabolomics datasets were used to demonstrate the application of RM-ASCA+. In the first dataset, the impact of neoadjuvant bevacizumab on tumor metabolism was assessed in a randomized controlled trial. RM-ASCA+ revealed that while the groups showed directionally similar metabolic trajectories over time, the slope was more steep for the treatment group, suggesting that the addition of bevacizumab may have augmented the chemotherapy response. In the second dataset, metabolic changes in serum after bariatric surgery were analyzed. RM-ASCA+ identified two distinct temporal trends, which were visualized as separate components. The first component showed a large increase in score value from baseline to the first follow-up and remained largely unaltered over time. This component described the decreased levels of BCAAs, AAAs, lipoprotein signal, and methanol and isopropylalcohol, and increased levels of methylsulfonylmethane, glycine, and ketone bodies. The second component was characterized primarily by temporarily increased levels of ketone bodies and citrate, which suggested changes in fat catabolism.In conclusion, RM-ASCA+ is a powerful methodology for analyzing longitudinal multivariate data, particularly in the context of clinical trials. It yields interpretable and efficient representations of findings while also revealing trends not previously apparent. RM-ASCA+ provides a highly flexible methodology that allows different coding systems and inclusion of covariates, making it suitable for various study designs.
 This study explores the time evolution of disease states in a chemical reaction network as a microscopic model for disease development and diagnosis. The system is represented by a set of interacting species and reactions, with the number of molecules serving as microscopic variables, or signs. Disease states are defined as macroscopic, emergent behaviors displayed by the sign variables, resulting from deviations in reaction rates from the healthy network.The model uses a reverse simulated annealing algorithm to introduce defects, or mutations, in the reaction network and study their impact on disease development and diagnosis. The objective function, initially set to maximize mutual information between signal and response variables, is decreased on average by the reverse annealing algorithm, potentially inducing a phase transition from the healthy state to a disease state.The study aims to provide a microscopic model for time-dependent signs and diseases, allowing for diagnosis based on the history or dynamics of observed signs and more explicit modeling of disease-disease interactions. The model is structured as follows:1. Model and Definitions: The model is defined, and the main equations are presented.2. Modeling Disease Evolution: The stochastic model of disease evolution is presented, along with numerical simulation results for a small reaction network.3. Concluding Remarks: The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings and their implications.The model assumes a fixed number of species and reactions, with the healthy state defined as the state of maximum mutual information between signal and response variables. The time evolution of a defect pattern is modeled through the introduction of mutations and acceptance probabilities, with the mutation and acceptance probabilities controlled by the parameters αr (t|D) and β (t|D), respectively. Interactions between evolving defects may change the rate of mutations and acceptance probabilities.The study's objectives include providing a microscopic model for generating synthetic data for probabilistic models of signs and diseases and presenting a dynamical model of disease evolution that can be used for diagnostic problems based on the dynamics or history of observed signs. The model is a starting point for capturing essential ingredients of disease progression and the clinical diagnostic problem.
 This study aimed to understand the relationship between transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the amount of virus present in the environment using a mathematical model. The model was developed to determine the relationship between viral kinetics in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and aerosols, and new transmissions in golden hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The study found that infectious virus shedding early in infection correlates with transmission events, shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection, and high viral RNA levels late in the infection are a poor indicator of transmission. The viral infectiousness increases in a density-dependent manner with viral RNA, and their relative ratio is time-dependent. These findings can be useful for designing interventions. The model was validated against two URT and one aerosol inoculation studies in golden hamsters and used to investigate the link between the infectious virus shed in the environment and the probability of a nearby host getting infected.
 This study addresses the problem of estimating the overlap between two communities, sets, or repertoires when only partial samples are available. Traditional methods for quantifying overlap, such as the Jaccard index and Sorenson-Dice coefficient, become estimation problems when community sizes are unknown. Previous efforts to address this issue have assumed knowledge of total community sizes and used Bayesian methods to produce unbiased estimates with quantified uncertainty. However, this study shows that estimating community sizes alongside overlap produces systematically better estimates.The method uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach, modeling the stochastic process that generates observed presence-absence data from two communities with unknown sizes and overlap. The joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameters is then used to produce unbiased a posteriori point estimates of the repertoire sizes and overlap, as well as to quantify uncertainty via credible intervals.The authors demonstrate the accuracy and uncertainty quantification of their method through numerical experiments using synthetic data. They also discuss the potential application of their approach to various fields, including malaria research, where understanding the overlap between parasite repertoires is crucial for understanding disease transmission and evolution.The study also highlights the importance of recording and reporting not only presence-absence but also abundance data, as the inclusion of total sampling effort can improve inferences and enable sample size calculations. However, the approach requires the specification of a prior distribution for the total community sizes, which may require users to make explicit their prior beliefs about community size.Limitations of the approach include assumptions about the sampling process, such as independent and uniform sampling from a population with identically represented unique genes, species, or objects. Future work could explore extensions to non-uniform sampling regimes or the analysis of communities with multiple parasite genomes within a single host.
 This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the evidence on the diagnostic validity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) for chronic Chagas Disease (CD). A search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS databases between 2010 and 2020. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias and applicability of the studies, and the bivariate random effects model was employed to estimate overall sensitivity and specificity.Forty-three studies were included, with 27 assessing ELISA tests, 14 assessing RDTs, and 2 evaluating both. Most studies were clinical-comparative or case-control design, and high risk of bias was detected for patient screening and reference standard. The ELISA tests had a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI: 98-99) and specificity of 98% (95% CI: 97-99), while RDTs had sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 94-97) and specificity of 97% (95% CI: 96-98). Deeks' test showed asymmetry on ELISA assays.Limitations included difficulty in extracting data due to missing information and the comparative clinical-type design of some studies. Despite these limitations, the analysis suggests that ELISA and RDT tests have high validity for diagnosing chronic CD. Future studies should focus on the variables influencing RDT validity and assess their usefulness in epidemiological contexts and diagnostic algorithms.
 This study presents a new computational model for dopamine (DA) transmission that considers the release, diffusion, and uptake of DA, with a focus on both synaptic and volume transmission. The model is unique as it is the only one to date that considers multiple release sites for DA. The importance of synaptic transmission has been debated, and the model simulates DA concentration in and near the synaptic cleft. After vesicle release, most DA molecules leave the synaptic cleft within less than a millisecond due to fast diffusion. Peri-synaptic DATs are saturated at early high concentrations, leading to discussions about volume transmission versus synaptic transmission. The model suggests that strongly pronounced DAT activity at the presynaptic terminal can not prevent DA from escaping the synaptic cleft, and diffusion rather than uptake is the dominating process directly after DA release. However, uptake is also critical for a balanced DA tone and intensely shapes the extra-synaptic DA signal near release sites. The simulations show that DA from a terminal, synaptic or non-synaptic, is highly localized to the release site, suggesting autocrine signals are mediated by a cell's own DA. The model can be used to investigate hypotheses concerning a single synapse and also a population of cells, and it may be used to mimic pharmacological manipulations or DA-related disease and disorders. The study also tests a hypothesis postulated by Laruelle that the challenge at D2Rs between endogenous DA and PET tracers is occurring primarily in the synaptic space when DA release is enhanced, contrasting with the extra-synaptic space when uptake is inhibited. The model suggests the possibility for enhanced challenges in synaptic compared to extra-synaptic space following nicotine administration, but this could not completely explain the strong difference in concentration occurring in parallel with no difference in D2R binding. The study emphasizes the importance of using different empirical methods to build simulation tools like the one presented here and encourages the combination of empirical and simulation methods to optimize each other.
 The degeneration of tick salivary glands, which occurs several days post engorgement, is a programmed cell death process mediated by ecdysone. Both autophagy and apoptosis are involved in this process, but their relationship is unclear. During the fast feeding phase, RhATG5, a homolog of the autophagy-related protein ATG5, is cleaved and both calcium concentration and the transcription of Rhcalpains increase in the salivary glands. Recombinant RhATG5 is cleaved by μ-calpain only in the presence of calcium, and the mutant RhATG5191-199Δ is not cleaved. High concentrations of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) lead to the cleavage of RhATG5 and the transition from autophagy to apoptosis. Ca2+ concentration and expression of Rhcalpains are also upregulated during this process. RNA interference (RNAi) of RhATG5 in vitro inhibits both autophagy and apoptosis, while RNAi in vivo significantly inhibits the normal feeding process. These results suggest that high concentrations of 20E lead to the cleavage of RhATG5 by increasing the concentration of calcium and stimulating the transition from autophagy to apoptosis.
 Yellow fever (YF) has seen significant changes in incidence and geographic extent over the past 20 years, with large outbreaks occurring in previously unaffected areas of South America, particularly in Brazil's South-East Atlantic forest. The causes of these expansions are not well understood, but habitat fragmentation and land-cover changes have been suggested as potential contributors. In this study, we investigated the role of vegetation, land-cover, climate, and host population in predicting YF transmission.We analyzed YF reports from 2003 to 2016 and identified 397 unique report months across 8 countries. Peru, Colombia, and Brazil accounted for the majority of report months. We used hierarchical negative binomial regression models to create ensemble models predicting interannual and seasonal variation in YF transmission. Our models explained a substantial amount of the observed variation, with R2 values of 0.43 (95% CI 0.41-0.45) for the interannual and 0.66 (95% CI 0.64-0.67) for the seasonal model.Vegetation, specifically the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), was the second most important predictor for both models, positively associated with YF reports. The log of human population was the most important predictor, as larger populations give more opportunities for spillover. Landcover and vegetation heterogeneity were also influential covariates in explaining interannual variation in YF reports. While cropland and savanna cover are negatively associated with YF reports, vegetation heterogeneity is positively associated, possibly acting as a proxy for habitat fragmentation.Our findings may help explain the recent expansions of the YF endemic zone and the highly seasonal nature of YF transmission. However, there is still a significant amount of unexplained variation in YF reports, which may be due to data limitations or the spatial resolution of the study. Future modelling work should consider the role of multi-year variation in covariates and investigate the relationship between climate and environment with YF spillover at the local or individual level.In conclusion, this study provides important insights into the seasonality and interannual transmission of YF across South America from 2003 to 2016. By identifying covariates and their statistical relationship with report months of YF, this work may be used to target surveillance in areas that have a higher risk of YF reporting based on their climate and environment, without currently reported cases. This application could have substantial public health value in a context where the geographic range of YF is changing and vaccine stocks are still limited.
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive thoughts or irresistible behaviors that interfere with daily life. Pavlovian cues, which can affect instrumental behavior through Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT), have been studied extensively in substance use disorders but less so in OCD. In this study, researchers investigated the effects of Pavlovian cues on instrumental behavior in both clinical OCD patients and healthy controls using a standard PIT task.The study involved 30 OCD patients and 31 healthy controls who completed the PIT task, which included instrumental training, Pavlovian training, and a PIT stage. Modified Rescorla-Wagner models were used to estimate underlying computational mechanisms and quantify individual differences during training and transfer stages.Behavioral and computational results indicated a weaker Pavlovian influence on instrumental behavior in OCD patients than in healthy controls, especially for negative Pavlovian cues. This contrasts with the increased PIT effects reported for substance use disorders. The reduced PIT in OCD may be due to impairments in using contextual information provided by the cues to appropriately adjust behavior, particularly when inhibiting responding when a negative cue is present.These findings provide deeper insight into the deficits in OCD from the perspective of Pavlovian influences on instrumental behavior and may have implications for OCD treatment modalities focused on reducing compulsive behaviors. However, it is important to note that this study did not examine all types of Pavlovian cues that may be relevant in OCD and future research is needed to examine PIT with stimuli tailored to the individual person’s area of compulsion. Additionally, the study did not examine the role of goal-directed learning in OCD, which could also contribute to the reduced PIT effect observed in this population.
 The Apicomplexa phylum, which includes parasites such as coccidians, haemosporidians, piroplasms, and cryptosporidia, is characterized by complex and divergent life cycles occupying various host niches. These parasites exhibit distinct adaptations to nutritional availabilities, either relying on biosynthetic pathways or salvaging metabolites from their host. Among these apicomplexans, only the coccidian subgroup, including Toxoplasma gondii and the cyst-forming parasite, can synthesize pantothenate (Pan), the precursor for cofactor coenzyme A (CoA).The Pan and CoA biosynthesis pathways have been extensively studied in T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, with recent advances revealing the suitability of these pathways as drug targets. Pan is synthesized from L-valine through a three-step process involving ketopantoate hydroxymethyl transferase (KPHMT), ketopantoate reductase (KPR), and pantoate-β-alanine ligase (PBAL or Pan synthetase). While other apicomplexans lack this pathway, the coccidians encode the enzymes catalyzing the three Pan synthesis reactions in only two genes, with the first two transformations catalyzed by a bifunctional KPHMT-KPR enzyme.Recent studies have shown that KPHMT-KPR and PBAL localize to the mitochondrion and nucleus, respectively, and that branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), which generates α-ketoisovalerate from L-valine, also localizes to the mitochondrion. However, whole-genome fitness score studies and pharmacological evidence suggest that Pan synthesis is not occurring in in vitro standard cultured T. gondii tachyzoites and that parasites are dependent on Pan salvage from the host cell.Despite the dispensability and inactivity of the synthesis pathway in tachyzoites, individual deletion of either KPHMT-KPR or PBAL gene in the cyst-forming type II strain of T. gondii resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of cysts in the mouse brain, indicating the utilization of Pan synthesis in bradyzoites. The retention of the Pan synthesis pathway exclusively in coccidians and the critical role of this pathway for establishment of chronic infection by T. gondii are intriguing.While most bacteria, plants, and fungi can synthesize Pan de novo, animals, including humans, require it from their diet. Pan is synthesized from L-valine through a three-step process involving hydroxymethyl transfer, reduction, and ligations. The enzymes catalyzing these reactions are ketopantoate hydroxymethyl transferase (KPHMT), ketopantoate reductase (KPR), and pantoate-β-alanine ligase (PBAL or Pan synthetase), respectively. While other apicomplexans lack this pathway altogether, the coccidians encode the enzymes catalyzing the three Pan synthesis reactions in only two genes, with the first two transformations catalyzed by a bifunctional KPHMT-KPR enzyme.Recently, a potent class of pantothenamides (PanAms), Pan analogs, which target CoA-utilizing enzymes, has entered antimalarial preclinical development. The potential of PanAms to target multiple downstream pathways makes them a promising compound class as broad antiparasitic drugs against other apicomplexans. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in understanding the Pan and CoA biosynthesis pathways and the suitability of these pathways as drug targets in Apicomplexa, with a particular focus on the cyst-forming coccidian, Toxoplasma gondii, and the haemosporidian, Plasmodium falciparum.The first step in the CoA synthesis pathway is the phosphorylation of Pan to 4′-phosphopantothenate, catalyzed by Pan kinase (PanK). This reaction is followed by the sequential formation of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine, 4′-phosphopantetheine, dephospho-CoA, and
 Membrane proteins have unique traits, including a significant fraction of hydrophobic amino acids being exposed to the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers rather than the protein interior. This property, often overlooked in protein structure and function predictions, can be described using the membrane contact probability (MCP). MCP quantifies the likelihood of amino acids in a sequence being in direct contact with the acyl chains of lipid molecules. It is complementary to solvent accessibility and can be predicted using machine learning methods based on the MemProtMD database. The MCP can improve the precision of protein contact maps and structures, making it an essential property for membrane protein studies. The MCP prediction is more accurate than simple hydrophobicity scales and agrees better with MD observations. It is also beneficial for 3D protein structure prediction and can be used to identify membrane-interacting residues of soluble or membrane-anchored proteins. However, limitations include the need for larger datasets with more comprehensive information and the inability to distinguish specific lipid-binding sites from the prediction alone. Future studies will explore potential applications, such as determining the correct orientation of membrane proteins when embedded into membranes and positioning membrane-anchored proteins in close proximity to membranes for further studies.
 The COVID-19 pandemic requires efficient and reliable simulation to predict and manage the spread of the disease. Traditional mathematical models, such as the SEIR approach, have limitations in handling population heterogeneity and spatial context at sufficient resolution. Agent-based models (ABMs), where agents represent individuals and move and transmit the infection among each other, offer unparalleled resolution and performance in terms of infection events and agent movement. PanSim is an agent-based model that allows for the contrast of various non-pharmaceutical interventions' efficacy. It uses a city-sized societal environment and considers factors such as age, sex, medical preconditions, and daily routines. The model simulates the spread of a fast-spreading virus variant, such as B.1.1.7, and its impact on hospitalization numbers.PanSim's key parameters include the infectiousness parameter k of the original strain, the increased transmissibility parameter for B.1.1.7, and the increased likelihood of hospitalization and death for B.1.1.7. The model also considers quarantine procedures, testing, and vaccination strategies. The results show that quarantine procedures following different rules, such as quarantining diagnosed infected patients only (Q1) or quarantining households and contacts (Q2 and Q3), significantly impact the severity of the pandemic. Extensive testing followed by quarantining can repress the pandemic with a moderately infective virus, but it is incapable of controlling the pandemic of a highly transmissible and more harmful variant, such as B.1.1.7, even with vaccination.Vaccination strategies prioritize either vulnerable groups or occupational risk groups. Vulnerability-based prioritization minimizes mortality but implies an increased infection rate, while occupational risk-based prioritization minimizes infections but allows for higher mortality. Increasing vaccination intensity has a larger effect on controlling the pandemic than varying the vaccination order. Curfew and lockdown of social event sites, restaurants, and pubs are crucial strategies to control pandemics by decreasing the number of interactions between individuals. The model also analyzes the effects of lifting these restrictions at different time points and shows that reopening close to the peak of the pandemic can lead to the collapse of the healthcare system and increase total death cases.The simulator was validated using contact matrices and hospitalization numbers from national data. The model follows the contact tracing concept, where housemates, classmates, or workmates of positively tested individuals are tested the next day with some probability. The model does not involve patients or the public in its design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans.
 This study aimed to develop a histology index for interpreting duodenal biopsies in children with environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a condition linked to poor childhood growth in low-income countries. Biopsies from four cohorts, including children with severe acute malnutrition in Zambia and Pakistan, children with clinically suspected gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and control children, were analyzed. The histology index, developed using a hypothesis-free approach, includes 11 histopathological parameters representing various injury response mechanisms. Inter-observer concordance was assessed, and the index showed good agreement among pathologists. The histology scores did not significantly correlate with clinical characteristics, including HIV infection status, anthropometric parameters, or laboratory markers. The Pakistani cohort had markedly increased IELs and notable enterocyte injury, epithelial detachment, and severe villous architectural damage compared to the other cohorts. The index can be used to identify histopathologic processes that distinguish EED from other enteropathies and inform novel intervention targets and assess response to interventions. Future work includes refining the scoring system and applying it to a larger and more diverse cohort of patients with EED.
 Transparent games are a new game-theoretic setting where players have a probabilistic access to the information about the current choices of other players. In contrast to classical simultaneous and sequential games, transparent games allow for action visibility, which significantly affects the evolution of cooperation in two-player two-action games. In this study, the authors focus on the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and the iterated (Anti-) Coordination Game (i(A)CG) and demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partner's choice before making one's own decision substantially changes the evolutionary successful strategies.In both games, the authors show that "Win-stay, lose-shift" (WSLS) and "Tit-for-tat" (TFT) strategies are predominant for moderate transparency, while a "Leader-Follower" (L-F) strategy emerges for high transparency. The results have implications for studies of human and animal social behavior, especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions.In the transparent versions of the games, the structure of the Nash equilibria for the Hawk-Dove and Leader games is identical to that of the i(A)CG, suggesting that transparency has a strong effect on successful strategies in these games as well. The authors also discuss the potential applications of transparent games to experimental research on social interactions and the analysis of cooperation in various contexts.In summary, transparent games provide a theoretically attractive link between classical concepts of simultaneous and sequential games and a computational tool for modeling real-world interactions. The approach allows integrating work on sensorimotor decision-making under uncertainty with economic game theory, and is expected to help establish a deeper understanding of social behavior in humans and animals.
 Telomere maintenance mechanisms in human cancers primarily involve telomerase activity or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. ALT is utilized by 15% of cancers, particularly those of mesenchymal origin, and is characterized by extreme telomere length heterogeneity and an absence of telomerase activity. The ALT pathway is initiated by the loss of the Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked (ATRX) gene, which is frequently found in ALT cancers.The loss of ATRX, coupled with telomere dysfunction during crisis, is sufficient to initiate the ALT pathway and confer replicative immortality in human fibroblasts. In HCT116 epithelial cancer cells, the loss of ATRX and telomere dysfunction during crisis led to the initiation of an ALT-like pathway, characterized by rapid and precise telomeric elongation and the induction of C-circles. However, this process was transient, and the telomeres ultimately continued to erode, leading to either cell death or the escape from crisis associated with telomerase activation.Telomere sequencing revealed that all alleles, regardless of whether they were elongated, were enriched in variant repeat types, which appeared to be cell-line specific. These findings demonstrate that the loss of ATRX combined with telomere dysfunction during crisis induces the ALT pathway in fibroblasts and enables a transient activation of ALT in epithelial cells.
 Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite, utilizes secretory organelles called rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules to invade host cells. Dense granules, which are randomly distributed in the parasite cytosol, play a crucial role in modulating host metabolic and immune responses by releasing effectors. The mechanisms regulating dense granule exocytosis at the parasite plasma membrane are not well understood.In this study, the role of Rab11A, a known regulator of exocytosis in eukaryotic cells, in promoting the cytoskeleton-driven transport of dense granules and the release of their content into the vacuolar space was investigated. Rab11A also regulates transmembrane protein trafficking and localization during parasite replication and regulates extracellular parasite motility and adhesion to host cells.Rab11A localizes to the Golgi/Endosome-Like Compartment (ELC) during the G1 phase and co-distributes with TgSortilin-like Receptor (TgSORTLR), a TGN marker. During cytokinesis, Rab11A is mostly localized adjacent to the Rab5A signal defining the early ELC and transports newly synthesized material between the Golgi and the apical tip of the growing buds. Rab11A also accumulates at the basal pole of the parasite at the end of cytokinesis.Using super-resolution live imaging, bi-directional trajectories of Rab11A-positive vesicles between the basal and apical poles of the parasite both within the parasite cytosol and along the parasite cortex were observed. Rab11A also plays a role in vesicle budding from the TGN/ELC, cargo transport between the apical and basal poles of the parasite, and material exchange between replicating parasites via release of vesicles at the basal pole.Rab11A regulates actin-dependent material exchanges between parasites or the dynamics of the cell-to-cell connecting network by regulating actin-dependent vesicle movements. Rab11A-positive vesicles and tubular-like structures were observed within the residual body region, which harbors a dense actino-myosin network that interconnects intracellular dividing tachyzoites. Rab11A-positive vesicles move along actin-positive structures at the parasite cortex or anchor to dynamic F-actin structures within the parasite cytosol. Depolymerizing actin filaments by cytochalasin D led to the formation of cytosolic and cortical Rab11A-positive clusters that displayed confined trajectories.Collectively, these data demonstrate that Rab11A plays a multifaceted role in regulating dense granule exocytosis, transmembrane protein delivery at the parasite plasma membrane, and extracellular parasite motility and adhesion to host cells.
 This study investigates the behavior of a computational model of the barrel cortex network (BCN) in response to single-cell stimulation using different readout schemes. The BCN is a recurrent network consisting of excitatory regular spiking (RS) neurons, inhibitory fast-spiking (FS) neurons, and somatostatin-expressing low-threshold spiking (SOM-LTS) inhibitory neurons. The network keeps firing asynchronously and does not burst, and the probability of a behavioral response is not substantially influenced by the duration or intensity of a constant stimulus but is strongly dependent on whether irregular or regular stimuli are used.The model includes several features of the barrel cortex, such as spike-frequency adaptation, experimentally constrained numbers and types of chemical synapses with short-term plasticity, and gap junctions. The results indicate that cellular and synaptic adaptation mechanisms alone may not suffice to account for the experimental results if the local network activity is read out by an integrator. However, a circuit that approximates a differentiator can detect the single-cell stimulation with a reliability that barely depends on the length or intensity of the stimulus but increases when an irregular signal is used.The findings are in accordance with experimental results obtained for the stimulation of a regularly-spiking excitatory cell and suggest that the barrel cortex responds more like a differentiator than an integrator. The model suggests that at least one further processing stage is needed to explain the experiments from ref. [6], which, in these earlier work, was not needed to explain the response properties of the barrel cortex. The involvement of further processing stages is also reasonable if one takes into account that the barrel cortex is part of a primary sensory area and that it is unlikely that it can encode a decision or elicit a motor response directly.The study also considers the effect of different stimulus properties on the response probability of the detector for each of the three readout procedures. The results show that the probability of a behavioral response is not substantially influenced by the duration or intensity of a constant stimulus but is strongly dependent on whether irregular or regular stimuli are used. The model suggests that the increased response probability for an irregular stimulation and the weak sensitivity to a step-current bring to mind the observation that irregular stimuli increase the response consistency of a single cortical cell in vitro. However, it is still unclear whether specific anatomical properties of the barrel cortex make it particularly sensitive to the single-cell stimulation. The model suggests that other cortical areas might be sensitive to the single-cell stimulation if they possess similar characteristics.The study also investigates how the properties of the stimulus influence the response probability of the detector for each of the three readout procedures.

 This study analyzed the genome changes in single cell lineages from human skin fibroblasts and melanocytes to accurately measure the load and types of somatic genome changes attributable to different DNA damaging processes in each cell. The researchers grew and expanded the cells, extracted genomic DNA, and performed whole-genome sequencing. They identified and removed deaminated cytosines from genomic DNA as an artifact of DNA extraction. They also used three independent mutation callers and stringent filtering criteria to identify clone-specific mutations that were not present in blood of the same donors. The final mutation calls were filtered based on allele frequencies. The researchers also identified and removed structural variants that were present in the dbSNP138 database or overlapped SimpleRepeats tracts. They used Delly to identify structural variants and determined clonality based on the allelic fraction of reads supporting the variants in the clone. They also identified and verified indels using the tool SV-ABA and filtered based on multiple criteria. The researchers used SigProfilerMatrixGenerator and SigProfilerExtractor to identify the different types of indels in their samples and deconvolute the single base substitution, dinucleotide base substitution, and indel signatures in their samples. They also calculated the enrichment of mutation signatures in each sample and identified the contributions of COSMIC signatures in their samples using MutationalPatterns. The study provides an accurate and comprehensive catalog of the somatic genome changes attributable to different DNA damaging processes in human skin cells, which is required for defining disease level of somatic genome instability. The study was conducted using samples from healthy cancer-free skin, and all participants provided written consent and self-identified race. The samples were collected from donors' hips, and fibroblasts and melanocytes were identified and grown in culture. The researchers also analyzed whole-genome sequenced clonal hip fibroblasts from two donors obtained in a previous study.
 Clonorchiasis, caused by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis, is a neglected tropical disease and a public health issue in endemic countries, including Vietnam. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of C. sinensis infection and associated risk factors in rural communities in northern Vietnam. The study was conducted in Yen Bai and Thanh Hoa provinces, where clonorchiasis is known to be present and raw fish consumption is common. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in four communes, using a simple random sampling approach and collecting stool samples from 841 participants over 6 years old for coprological examination and questionnaires from 757 participants over 15 years old. The overall prevalence of C. sinensis infection was 40.4%, with significant differences between communes. Males, recent raw fish consumption, low education level, lack of treatment, being between 19 to 39 years old, and the presence of an unhygienic toilet were significantly associated with C. sinensis infection. The study highlights the need for control measures, including mass drug administration and health education campaigns, to reduce the prevalence of clonorchiasis in endemic areas.
 Skin problems, including scabies, tungiasis, and tinea infections, are significant health concerns for schoolchildren in rural Ethiopia, despite receiving less attention in global health studies due to their low mortality rates. Previous studies have attempted to identify risk factors using the frequentist approach, but this study aimed to assess occurrence and risk factors using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.The study assessed 864 schoolchildren aged 7-14 years in the Wonago district of southern Ethiopia, detecting potential risk factors for scabies, tungiasis, and tinea infections and recording hygienic practices and socio-demographic information. The frequentist model revealed a clustering effect of 8.8% at the classroom level and an insignificant effect at the school level, while the Bayesian model revealed a clustering effect of 16% at the classroom level and 5.3% at the school level. Almost three-quarters of the sample had at least one type of skin problem, and boys were at higher overall risk than girls (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.55 [95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 1.01, 2.28]).Risk factors for skin infections included unclean fingernails, not washing the body or hair with soap every week, sharing beds, clothes, or combs, and living in a poor household. Washing legs and feet with soap daily was identified as a protective factor for each of the three skin diseases. The findings suggest the need to improve children's personal hygiene through health education by schoolteachers and health workers.The study also observed high variation in skin problems at the classroom level, indicating the presence of shared risk factors in these locations. The findings underscore the importance of the Bayesian approach for explaining variations in skin problems and highlight the need for improved school health services and policies to address contagious and highly transmissible skin conditions in Ethiopia.
 This study investigates the role of miR-206 in mycobacterial infection using the zebrafish model of Mycobacterium marinum infection. MiR-206 is a muscle-associated miRNA that has been implicated in viral pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and reducing replication of influenza virus. In the context of mycobacterial infection, miR-206 expression is dynamically regulated, and its impact on disease is assessed through assessing the bacterial burden following antagomiR knockdown. The results show that miR-206 is upregulated following infection by pathogenic M. marinum and that antagomir-mediated knockdown of miR-206 is protective against infection. This protection is dependent on the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling axis, as shown by enhanced neutrophil recruitment to sites of infection and reduced bacterial burden. Overall, this study demonstrates that pathogenic mycobacteria induce host miR-206 expression to suppress Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling and prevent protective neutrophil recruitment to granulomas.
 The epidermis is maintained by continuous cell divisions in the basal layer, where cells can irreversibly delaminate and differentiate. Graph neural network (GNN) models are used to predict cell fate and infer cell interactions in the spatiototemporal dynamics of the epidermis. The GNN model takes in spatiotemporal graphs and cell features, and outputs predictions on the behavior of cells. The model was trained on cell track data from the mouse hind paw and ear epidermis, and the results showed that the GNN model can predict cell fates with significant accuracy and extract cell interaction rules. The model identified neighboring cell fate coordination rules that depend on the region of the body, and demonstrated the ability to infer general cell interaction rules from live data without prior knowledge of the signaling involved. The GNN approach is particularly suited for representing the heterogeneous interactions between cells and the intracellular features extractable from image data. Future work includes testing the model on other tissues and incorporating the replication of nodes in the analysis of multicellular systems.
 This study presents a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers. TSCCA is able to overcome the limitations of existing solutions and capture both cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. The performance of TSCCA was evaluated using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The results uncovered several dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance. These modules can advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and provide insights into miRNA-based treatments for cancer.Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Despite medical advances, researchers still face challenges for cancer drug resistance, combinatorial drug treatment optimization, and personalized cancer therapy design. An increasing number of studies have reported that abnormal microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cancer occurrence and development, and some miRNAs can be used as drug targets for cancer treatment. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression during post-transcriptional processes. In cancer cells, miRNAs have been found to be heavily dysregulated. Thus, they are potential candidates for prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.With the development of miRNA sequencing technology, a vast amount of miRNA expression data for multiple species has been accumulated. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCI-60 allow us to obtain matched miRNA and mRNA expression data in certain cancers. These invaluable database repositories provide new paradigms to explore context-specific miRNA-gene regulatory relationship. Several computational methods have been proposed to discover miRNA-gene modules for one cancer or tissue, but they fail to identify cancer-specific and shared miRNA-gene modules when integrating multiple cancer data.Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop new methods to explore the complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns by integrating multi-omics data of multi-cancers. In this study, we present a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for the explorative analysis of matched miRNA and gene expression data of multiple cancers with a focus on identifying cancer-specific and shared miRNA-gene co-expressed modules. TSCCA first calculates a cancer-miRNA-gene correlation tensor, which is a "3D" array with gene, miRNA, and cancer dimensions. Then it decomposes the correlation tensor into a number of latent factors that represent major patterns of variation in the tensor data. Based on their non-zero elements, we can discover a cancer-miRNA-gene module. The main contributions of this study are the design of a statistical learning model TSCCA and the development of an efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm to solve it. The application of TSCCA to a multi-omics data set of 33 cancer types from TCGA database discovered some dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance.
 Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to modify their strength in response to experience, is a crucial mechanism underlying learning and memory. Both short-term and long-term plasticity have been extensively studied, but their interaction and how it shapes synaptic dynamics are less well understood. In this study, researchers used a calcium-based model to investigate how short-term and long-term plasticity together control the induction of synaptic depression and potentiation.The model assumes that pre- and postsynaptic activity induces calcium transients, which in turn drive synaptic long-term plasticity. The researchers found that the model can successfully fit short-term plasticity data obtained in visual and somatosensory cortex, and that the impact of spike-timing and firing rate changes on plasticity occurs in the prevalent firing rate range, which is different in both cortical areas considered.The findings suggest that short- and long-term plasticity are together tuned to adapt plasticity to area-specific activity statistics, such as firing rates. The researchers also found that short-term depression and long-term plasticity interact during induction protocols of synaptic long-term changes using combinations of firing rate and spike-timing. However, the brain region and synapse-specific realizations of short- and long-term plasticity mechanisms remain to be explored.The study provides insights into the complex interplay between short-term and long-term plasticity and highlights the importance of considering both time scales when understanding synaptic function and plasticity.
 This study aimed to compare the early response of Australian black flying foxes and ferrets to Hendra virus (HeV) infection, focusing on the immune response and differences in viral replication. The study used juvenile bats and ferrets, with bats born in captivity and ferrets sourced from a commercial supplier. Animals were inoculated via the oronasal route and euthanized at various time points post-exposure.Viral antigen was detected in the lungs of both bats and ferrets, but the distribution and tissue response differed. In bats, viral antigen was confined to the lung interstitium, while in ferrets, it was also identified in bronchiolar epithelium. In ferrets, there was a prominent inflammatory response and tissue degenerative changes, while in bats, there was minimal tissue and inflammatory response.Transcription of type I and III IFNs and the chemokine CXCL10 revealed species-specific expression patterns. The results showed that both type I and III IFNs were antagonized following HeV infection in bat tissues, but in ferret spleen, IFNA and IFNB increased significantly following infection. CXCL10 increased significantly at 60 hpe in bat lung and spleen tissues, suggesting a protective role in bats.Proteomic analysis of bat and ferret lung tissue at 0 and 60 hpe provided insights into differences in immune pathway activation between the two species. Gene ontology analysis revealed that IFN signaling was upregulated at 60 hpe in the two bats and in one of the two ferret datasets. Proteins contributing to pathways involving neutrophil mediated immunity, T cell mediated immunity, and antibody mediated immunity were significantly more likely to be upregulated in bats compared to ferrets.The study contributes important comparative data on the differences in activation of the host response to HeV in species that respond with innocuous (bats) versus fatal (ferrets) outcomes. The findings suggest an important role for the cell mediated immune response in bats and the potential importance of downregulating the IFN response to avoid immunopathology. Further experiments using larger numbers of each species and more targeted analytical techniques are needed to confirm these findings.
 The study presents CLiP (Correlated Liability Predictors), a method to detect heterogeneity in single GWAS cohorts using a liability threshold model. The method calculates a weighted sum of correlations between SNPs contributing to a polygenic risk score (PRS) on the case/control liability scale. The authors demonstrate mathematically and through simulations that among identical homogeneous cases, significant anti-correlations are expected between otherwise independent predictors due to ascertaination on the hidden liability score. In the presence of heterogeneity from distinct etiologies, confounding by covariates, or mislabeling, these correlation patterns are altered predictably. The authors further extend the method to two additional association study designs: CLiP-X for quantitative predictors in applications such as transcriptome-wide association studies, and CLiP-Y for quantitative phenotypes, where there is no clear distinction between cases and controls. Through simulations, they demonstrate that CLiP and its extensions reliably distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous cohorts when the PRS explains as low as 3% of variance on the liability scale and cohorts comprise 50,000-100,000 samples. The authors apply CLiP to heterogeneity detection in schizophrenia cohorts and observe significant heterogeneity in mega-analysis of the combined PGC data and in individual cohorts, based on significantly associated variants. They also apply CLiP-Y to detect heterogeneity in neuroticism and detect heterogeneity with a p-value of 1.68 × 10−9. The scores were not significantly reduced when partitioning by known subclusters, suggesting that these factors are not the primary source of observed heterogeneity.
 This study aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize influenza-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The model was trained using two different sets of data, Training 1 and Training 2, which both showed great sensitivity and specificity in recognizing influenza-induced CPE. Training 1, which consisted of 601 images, displayed slightly better performance than Training 2, which had 503 images but more diverse data. The increment in the number of training data was likely due to the bias of training, where more information leads to better accuracy. Training 1 also showed statistically significant earlier recognition of influenza-induced CPE at earlier time points. The model was designed to screen for early recognition of influenza-infected samples and could identify cytopathic effects at 16 hours post-infection. The recognition rate of images taken at 28 hours post-infection was 98.25% and 96.25% for Trainings 1 and 2, respectively. The model was superior to R-mix, which has been shown to be better than conventional culture, and could reduce the screening time for virus isolation. However, one potential pitfall for the model is higher false positive ratios at earlier time points. The model consisted of ten layers, and the larger sizes of convolutional filters and max-pooling kernels were used to provide sufficient information to recognize the features of cytopathic effects. The model was also compared with a transfer learning model, and the accuracy of the model without transfer learning was better by at least 20%. The model was established with small amounts of training data yet having great performance. Future work includes training other models to recognize different kinds of cytopathic effects and applying the model structure to other similar imaging approaches. MDCK cells were cultured in Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Influenza virus and parainfluenza virus were amplified in MDCK cells, and other viruses were amplified in HEp2 or MK2 cells. The harvested virus supernatant was titrated by the plaque assay and stored at -80°C for subsequent experiments. MDCK cells were infected with influenza virus, adenovirus, HSV-1, HSV-2, coxsackievirus B3, parainfluenza virus, and RSV for one hour before the addition of MEM supplemented with 2ug/mL TPCK trypsin. The multiplicity of infection of influenza virus used in the study was 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. The cytopathic effects were recorded by the Olympus IX71 microscope at 16 and 48 hours after infection. The dataset was split into four sets: training set, validation set, testing set, and experiment set. The cytopathic effects were monitored at 16 hours post-infection, and the photos taken in the last two experiments were used as the testing set and the influenza experiment set. All of the training data, testing data, and influenza experiment data included photos of uninfected MDCK cells and influenza-infected MDCK cells. The images of other viruses set were all taken at 40 hours post-infection and were not further labeled. The images of cytopathic effects were recorded by the Olympus IX71 microscope, and the fields were selected and photographed continuously and refocused randomly. The fields of uninfected cells were taken randomly as negative samples. The images of the training, testing set, and influenza experiment set were not taken from the same infection experiment for independence. The model was trained using back propagation, and the weights of the CNN model were initialized randomly. The model was trained using TensorFlow deep learning framework.
 Herpesviruses, including Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), encode inhibitors of host cell death, specifically RIP Homotypic Interaction Motif (RHIM)-containing proteins. VZV is responsible for causing chickenpox and shingles, and we have identified a novel viral RHIM in the VZV capsid triplex protein, open reading frame (ORF) 20. This ORF20 RHIM acts as a host cell death inhibitor and forms fibrillar functional amyloid complexes. Notably, it forms hybrid amyloid complexes with human ZFP1, a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acid. Although VZV can inhibit TNF-induced necroptosis, the ORF20 RHIM does not appear to be responsible for this inhibition. Instead, the ZFP1 pathway is identified as important for VZV infection. Mutation of the ORF20 RHIM renders the virus incapable of efficient spread in ZFP1-expressing HT-29 cells, an effect which can be reversed by the inhibition of caspases. Therefore, the VZV ORF20 RHIM is important for preventing ZFP1-driven apoptosis during VZV infection and mediates this effect by sequestering ZFP1 into decoy amyloid assemblies.Herpesviruses, including Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are masters at manipulating host cell death pathways, such as apoptosis and necroptosis, to successfully spread and establish latency. VZV is an exclusively human pathogen and causes significant health burden, but the mechanisms employed by VZV to evade host responses have not been fully elucidated. Primary infection with VZV leads to varicella, or chickenpox, and during this infection, the virus establishes latency within sensory neurons. When VZV-specific T cell immunity wanes, the virus can reactivate to result in herpes zoster, or shingles. Complications arising from VZV reactivation include post-herpetic neuralgia, encephalitis, and VZV vasculopathy. VZV is a highly cell-associated virus and does not release cell-free virions into culture, necessitating cell-associated propagation of the virus in vitro. VZV is also highly species-specific and can only establish a full productive infection in cells of human origin, making it difficult to study its pathogenesis.Cell death can be initiated upon sensing of a viral pathogen as a means of prematurely aborting the virus lifecycle and limiting the spread of infection. Apoptosis and necroptosis may form part of the antiviral response. The most well-characterized pathway of necroptosis is that induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Upon TNF binding to its receptor (TNF-R1), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP1 and 2) mediate K63-ubiquitination of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), as part of a signaling platform known as complex I, which drives NF-κB signaling. If cIAPs are inhibited, RIPK1 can associate with FADD, caspase 8, and cFLIP (termed complex II), leading to the cleavage of caspase 8 to drive apoptosis. However, if caspase 8 is also inhibited, RIPK1 can interact with receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) to drive necroptosis. RIPK1 and RIPK3 interact via highly conserved RHIMs, leading to the assembly of the necrosome complex. The RIPK1:RIPK3 necrosome complex has a fibrillar structure and is stabilized by an amyloid cross-β core, formed by interactions between the RHIMs of the two component proteins. Generation of the necrosome results in the phosphorylation of RIPK3, which subsequently phosphorylates mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Phosphorylated MLKL drives membrane permeabilization, resulting in rupture of the cell and necroptotic cell death.The cellular Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZFP1, also known as DAI) contains at least two RHIMs (A and B) and
 This study aimed to understand the relative contributions of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability to the presence and intensity of Schistosoma haematobium re-infection in an endemic region of northern Senegal. The researchers collected parasitological, ecological, and socio-economic data from 13 villages along the Senegal River. They found that hazard, as measured by the area of snail habitat in the water access point nearest a household, and vulnerability, in terms of surface water use and access to sanitation at the household level, were the most important components of S. haematobium presence. Exposure, approximated by a self-reported categorical frequency of contact with surface water per week, and hazard contributed most to the accumulation of S. haematobium parasites in school-age children and thus to infection intensity. The findings highlight the importance of all three components of risk, which act together across time and space to facilitate the acquisition and accumulation of S. haematobium infections in an endemic setting with high incidence of post-treatment re-infection. The insights about the interaction among different components of risk and their impact on different metrics of infection may apply in other endemic settings and generate new knowledge about the processes that lead to the occurrence of persistent hotspots. Understanding the complex relationship between exposure, hazard, and vulnerability is critical to controlling the severe morbidity of schistosomiasis, reducing the transmission of parasites in the environment, and achieving elimination in endemic regions.
 Nigeria has experienced recurring outbreaks of Lassa fever (LF), a hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus (LASV), primarily in endemic West African countries including Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The 2018 Nigerian LF outbreak resulted in over 633 confirmed cases and 171 deaths. The disease burden in Nigeria has been increasing annually, with the majority of infections occurring in northern Nigeria. LASV has a high degree of genetic diversity, making it crucial to understand the scope of LASV pathogenesis and evaluate potential vaccines and medical countermeasures using contemporary isolates from West Africa.Five LASV isolates were collected during the 2018 Nigerian outbreak and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Three isolates, NML-33, NML-46, and NML-57, were selected for characterization in the strain 13 guinea pig model. Despite being closely related and from the same geographic region, only NML-33 proved lethal in both guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs). NML-33 exhibited atypical pathogenesis characteristics, most notably respiratory failure, not commonly described in hemorrhagic cases of LF. These results suggest that there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in LASV infections in Nigeria, which could account for differences between subclinical and lethal LF infections.The development of disease models using currently circulating LASV strains in West Africa is critical for evaluating potential vaccines and medical countermeasures. The characterization of genetically and geographically diverse LASV isolates in animal models of disease is essential to understanding the scope of LASV pathogenesis and the possible discovery of a universal vaccine candidate.
 Schistosomiasis, caused by blood-dwelling parasites of the genus Schistosoma, affects over 260 million people globally and over 800 million are at risk. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on hematological and biochemical changes among adult patients attending Haik Primary Hospital in Ethiopia.A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2021, involving 180 participants, including 90 S. mansoni infected adults and 90 healthy controls. The mean age of S. mansoni infected patients and healthy controls was 30.33±12.26 years and 31.2±12.85 years, respectively.The prevalence of anemia and thrombocytopenia among S. mansoni infected patients were 23.3% and 26.7%, respectively. Erythrocytic sedimentation rate (ESR) was significantly elevated among S. mansoni infected patients than healthy controls. The median white blood cell count, red blood cell count, red blood cell indices, and platelet indices were significantly lower among S. mansoni infected patients compared to healthy controls. The median eosinophil count was significantly higher among S. mansoni infected patients than healthy controls.Several liver function tests were also significantly altered in S. mansoni infected patients compared to healthy controls, including elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and direct bilirubin, and decreased levels of albumin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.The findings of this study highlight the importance of screening for S. mansoni infection in endemic areas, particularly among patients with hematological and/or biochemical abnormalities. The study also emphasizes the need for early diagnosis and treatment of S. mansoni infection to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Further studies are recommended to investigate the mechanisms of anemia and thrombocytopenia in S. mansoni infected patients and to evaluate the clinical severity parameters and markers of fibrosis and granulomatous inflammatory cytokines.
 This study aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying suboptimal anti-E2 antibody responses in HCV infection, as inducing high titers of anti-E2 antibodies is a goal of HCV vaccine development. The researchers hypothesized that B cell dysfunction contributes to poor anti-E2 responses in some individuals. They detected HCV E2-specific B cells using a cocktail of soluble E2 (sE2) proteins and analyzed their frequencies and cell surface molecule expression profiles.The researchers observed that sE2+ csBC (class-switched B cells) from both Persistence and Clearance subjects had reduced frequencies of resting memory B cells (rMBC), increased frequencies of activated MBC and tissue-like MBC, and significantly upregulated expression of FCRL5. Plasma anti-E2 IgG levels were positively correlated with frequencies of sE2+ rMBC and sE2+ actMBC, while negatively correlated with levels of FCRL5 expression on sE2+ rMBC and PD-1 expression on sE2+ actMBC.These findings suggest that B cell dysfunction begins in acute HCV infection, and overexpression of FCRL5 on rMBC and PD-1 on actMBC is associated with reduced anti-E2 IgG production in vivo. Further studies are needed to determine if limiting the upregulation of these molecules could potentially generate higher titers of protective antibodies against HCV or other pathogens.The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine's Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided informed written consent. Blood samples were obtained from the Baltimore Before and After Acute Study of Hepatitis (BBAASH) cohort, a prospective cohort of injection drug users in Baltimore followed from before HCV infection through spontaneous clearance/persistence. HCV viral loads were quantified using real-time PCR, and subjects were assigned to either the Clearance or Persistence group based on infection outcome. Genes encoding E2 ectodomains were cloned into a mammalian expression vector, and sE2 expression and ELISA were performed. Sorted B cells were cultured in vitro for antibody production analysis.
