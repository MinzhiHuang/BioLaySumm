 Microtubules, filamentous polymers central to intracellular transport, can generate force and drive motility directly. During mitosis, dynamic microtubules transport chromosomes by shortening while their disassembling tips remain coupled to the chromosomes via kinetochores. Force generation depends on either biased diffusion or conformational wave mechanisms. The conformational wave hypothesis suggests that curling protofilaments physically hook the kinetochore and pull against it to drive motility. Prior work showed that the amount of mechanical strain energy released by curling protofilaments is sufficient for kinetochore motility, but whether kinetochores harness any of this strain energy remains unclear due to the lack of methods for modifying mechanical or energetic properties of protofilament curls.To investigate this, researchers developed an assay for measuring forces and displacements generated by curling protofilaments. They found that adding magnesium enlarges pulses independently of its acceleration of disassembly, indicating that magnesium directly stabilizes the longitudinal bonds within protofilament curls. Pulses generated by yeast tubulin are larger than those generated by bovine brain tubulin, and a simple mechanical model shows that both the magnesium- and species-dependent changes in pulse energy can be explained solely by increasing the contour lengths of protofilament curls without changing their intrinsic flexural rigidity or curvature. These findings suggest that protofilament flexural rigidity and stored lattice strain are crucial to microtubule function.Microtubules were purified from bovine brain and yeast using two cycles of polymerization and depolymerization. Wild-type yeast αβ-tubulin was purified using nickel affinity and ion exchange chromatography. Tubulin samples for the laser trap assays were prepared, aliquoted, snap-frozen, and shipped on dry ice. Anti-His beads were prepared by incubating streptavidin-coated polystyrene microspheres with biotinylated anti-penta-His antibodies, washed, and stored. For each experiment, a small channel was formed by bonding a KOH-cleaned glass coverslip to a clean glass slide using double-stick tape. Biotinylated bovine serum albumin was incubated in the channel, washed out, and avidin DN was incubated and washed out. GMPCPP-stabilized, biotinylated microtubule seeds were assembled and incubated in the channel. Just prior to each experiment, a small aliquot of anti-His beads was pre-incubated with a mixture of plain and biotinylated BSA, decorated with His6-yeast tubulin, and added to growth buffer containing 10-25 µM bovine tubulin.The optical trap instrument used for the assay consisted of a Nikon inverted microscope, a 1064 nm Nd:YVO4 laser for trapping, a 473 nm laser for microtubule cutting, and custom software written in LabVIEW for instrument control and data acquisition. Suitable beads laterally attached to coverslip-anchored microtubules were identified, and suitable microtubules were firmly anchored by one end to the slide surface and able to freely rotate about their surface anchor without interfering microtubules bundled alongside or crossing along their length. To establish the initial loaded state, the laterally attached bead was trapped, and the microtubule and bead were pulled in the opposite direction of the tether, toward the cutting laser location. The beads were raised slightly above the coverslip surface to ensure the surface did not interfere with measurement. The force clamp was initiated, and microtubule depolymerization was triggered by trimming off the stabilizing cap using the cutting laser. Position signals from the trapped bead were recorded using the force clamp software.Candidate pulses were evaluated for inclusion in data analysis based on their amplitude relative to the standard deviation of the baseline noise. The fraction of events that yielded measurable pulses in bovine microtubule experiments was lower than in yeast microtubule experiments mainly because the pulses were smaller on average and therefore more of them fell below the detection threshold. The force-deflection relationship for multiple protofilaments at a microtubule tip interacting with a bead was calculated by assuming the bead to be an infinitely flat, rigid surface and protofilaments distributed radially about the microtubule axis in a 13-protofilament configuration. The
 Hagfishes, a class of epibenthic jawless vertebrates, produce a unique and effective defensive slime when attacked. This slime is composed of fibrous threads and mucus, which rapidly expand and entrap large volumes of water, clogging the mouth and gills of predators. The evolution of this biomaterial is unclear, but evidence suggests that it may have originated from the epidermis.Large intracellular threads have been identified within a putatively homologous cell type from hagfish epidermis. These threads, which average ~2 mm in length and ~0.5 μm in diameter, are present throughout the hagfish body and are covered by a dense layer of epidermal thread cells. When the skin is damaged, these threads and mucus form an adhesive epidermal slime that is more fibrous and less dilute than the defensive slime.Transcriptome analysis suggests that epidermal threads are ancestral to the slime threads, with gene duplication and divergence generating a diversity of thread genes uniquely expressed in slime glands. The results support an epidermal origin of hagfish slime, which may have been driven by selection for stronger and more voluminous slime.ETCs, an unusual thread-producing cell in hagfish epidermis, are suspected to be homologous to GTCs in the slime glands. These cells produce a dense mass of granules of unknown function in the distal region of the cell, in addition to the threads. While the threads and granules appear to be secretory products, there is no evidence that they are released via merocrine or apocrine modes. A holocrine-like mechanism that depends on cell rupture is more likely.The abundance of ETCs in hagfish skin is significant, with an estimated total of ~1.2 × 10^7 ETCs covering the entire hagfish body, which is ~3.9 times greater than the total number of GTCs from all slime glands combined. The large mucous cells, which occur with a lower density than ETCs, play a role in producing the mucus components of epidermal slime.The helical geometry of epidermal threads has been studied using confocal microscopy, revealing that they are right-handed helices with a mean diameter of 0.35±0.1 μm and a mean pitch angle of 63.5°±5.6°. The threads are capable of plastic deformation and are mechanically robust, with no evidence of threads breaking even when they are sheared under a cover glass. The appearance of loose subfilament structure in some epidermal threads suggests that they may simply be a bundle of individual intermediate filaments.The evolution of slime glands from epidermis is a complex process that involves changes at the cellular level as well as larger scale morphological changes. A possible evolutionary scenario suggests that slime glands evolved through possible invagination of the epidermis, with cells specialized for slow release of mucus having little purpose and being excluded in favor of larger proportions of thread cells and large mucous cells. Future work will explore the morphological and genetic changes associated with the large mucous to gland mucous cell transition as well as the origin of the gland musculature.While an epidermal origin of hagfish slime glands is consistent with the morphological and molecular data presented here, it is not the only possible explanation. Another possibility is that hagfish defensive slime glands arose from cloacal glands, which are found in the dorsal wall of the cloaca and contain both thread and mucous cells. However, the genetic data and analysis are consistent with an epidermal origin for slime thread genes, and by extension, an epidermal origin of slime glands.Identifying other intermediate forms between epidermis and slime glands or finding new intermediate fossils may help to further clarify the evolution pathway from hagfish epidermis to slime glands.
 This study aimed to evaluate the disease-modifying effects of sodium selenate treatment in a rat model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using the kainic acid (KA)-induced post-status epilepticus (SE) model. Sodium selenate is a compound known to activate protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates and reduces hyperphosphorylated tau (h-tau), a neuropathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative conditions, including TLE.Ten-weeks post-SE, rats received sodium selenate, levetiracetam, or vehicle subcutaneous infusions for four weeks. Video-electroencephalogram (vEEG) recordings were acquired before, during, and after treatment to assess seizure occurrence and severity. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM), novel object placement (NOP), and novel object recognition (NOR) tests.The results showed that sodium selenate treatment was associated with a significant reduction in seizure number, cognitive dysfunction, and sensorimotor deficits compared to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, sodium selenate treatment increased PP2A expression, reduced h-tau, and reversed telomere length shortening. Network medicine integration identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with TLE, and the Purple and Yellow modules showed significant correlations with selenate-treated animals.These findings suggest that sodium selenate treatment has disease-modifying effects in an animal model of chronic drug-resistant TLE, making it a promising therapeutic approach for this common and disabling disease. The study's findings, if confirmed in clinical trials, could be paradigm-shifting for the treatment of TLE.
 This study introduces a new concept called 'Skeletal Age' to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for individuals. Using data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register, the study found that all types of fractures were associated with a loss of years of life, indicating that the skeletal age of individuals suffering from a fracture is greater than their chronological age. The findings have important implications, as patients with a fragility fracture have a significantly greater risk of mortality than their counterparts without fracture. The study also adjusted for comorbidities and found that the significant fracture-mortality association remained unchanged, suggesting that the association is unlikely due to comorbidities. The study proposes 'Skeletal Age' as a new metric for communicating the risk of mortality following a fracture, as it quantifies the consequence of a fracture using a natural frequency metric, which is easier and more friendly to doctors and patients than probability-based metrics. The use of 'Skeletal Age' can improve doctor-patient risk communication and potentially lead to preventive changes. The study's findings should be interpreted within the context of their strengths and limitations, including the use of registry-based data, the lack of adjustments for lifestyle factors, and the absence of an examination of the effect of bone metabolism-affecting medications on the assessment of skeletal health. Future research could include a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of 'Skeletal Age' and current metrics in fracture risk communication.
 The study proposes a deep neural network named Brain Extraction Net (BEN) for accurate brain tissue extraction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across different species, modalities, and MR scanners. BEN is a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised network that uses an adaptive batch normalization (AdaBN) strategy and an iterative pseudo-labeling procedure for semi-supervised learning. The network is evaluated on 18 datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans, and outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. BEN improves the robustness of atlas-to-target registration and brain volumetric quantification in neuroimaging and is an open-source and modularly designed toolbox that provides uncertainty maps to quantify the confidence of the network's decisions and to model interrater variability. The study demonstrates the potential of BEN to enhance neuroimaging studies at high throughput for both preclinical and clinical applications.
 Candida albicans, a common human fungal pathogen, utilizes external heme as both an iron source and a heme source through a unique uptake system involving CFEM hemophores. This system includes the capture of heme from host proteins by CFEM hemophores and its transfer across the cell wall to the cell membrane. While the mechanism for heme internalization into the cell was unknown, recent research identified two membrane proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, previously classified as FREs, as being essential for heme uptake. Frp1 is required for heme uptake under all conditions, while Frp2 contributes to heme uptake under alkaline conditions. The Frp1/2-CFEM hemophore pathway represents a new paradigm for heme uptake and utilization.Frp1 and Frp2 are adjacent to and share a promoter region with the CFEM protein genes PGA7 and CSA1, respectively. This synteny is maintained across most fungal genomes, further suggesting a common function in heme acquisition. Frp1 and Frp2 have been previously identified as genes that are highly induced under iron starvation conditions and under alkaline conditions. They are also required for optimal growth on hemin in the distantly related basidiomycete fungal pathogen C. neoformans.Frp1 and Frp2 function both as heme reductases and as heme receptors that bring the heme from the cell surface into the cell. They could function in the transport of heme into the cell as well, as they mediate the uptake of metal-substituted heme analogs such as ZnMP and the toxic metal-substituted PPIX derivatives. The affinity of heme for Frp1 and Frp2 might differ depending on pH, which could explain their differential roles in heme utilization under various conditions.In summary, Frp1 and Frp2 are essential for heme uptake into the cell and represent the missing link between the extracellular CFEM hemophore cascade and the intracellular heme endocytosis pathway to the vacuole. Their function as heme reductases and heme receptors allows for the efficient uptake and utilization of heme by C. albicans.
 The seventh pandemic of diarrheal cholera disease, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae, began in 1960 and is characterized by its environmental persistence and sudden outbreaks. V. cholerae's ability to adapt to changing environments is facilitated by sensory proteins, including ToxR and ToxS, which react to environmental stimuli such as bile acid. The crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS reveals an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. The ToxRS complex exposes a bile binding pocket inside ToxS, which is only properly built upon stabilization by newly formed structural elements of ToxR. The VtrAC complex of V. parahaemolyticus shares structural and functional similarities with ToxRSp, further emphasizing the significance of ToxRS within the recently defined superfamily of co-component signal transduction systems. The findings hold far-reaching implications for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings. ToxR is a transmembrane transcription factor that can function as an activator, co-activator, and repressor. Its periplasmic domain is proposed to act as an environmental sensor, binding bile acids and consequently activating transcription with its cytoplasmic DNA binding domain. ToxS is built of a periplasmic, a transmembrane, and a short cytoplasmic region. The periplasmic domain of ToxS interacts with the periplasmic domain of ToxR, forming a stable heterodimer and protecting ToxR from periplasmic proteolysis and enhancing its activity. The exact mechanism of ToxR functionality is not clear but is proposed to involve binding DNA as a homodimer at the 'tox-boxes' or using a topological DNA recognition mechanism. Bile significantly alters the virulence factor production, but the exact mechanism remains unclear, with studies showing opposite outcomes in regard to up- or downregulation of virulence factors by bile. The ToxRS complex plays a crucial role in Vibrio strains, as it sensitively regulates the expression system, enabling fine-tuning of transcription levels according to small changes in the pathogen's environment.
 The hippocampus is a complex brain structure involved in episodic memory and spatial navigation. Recent studies have identified functional differences along its anterior-posterior axis and its subfields, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences are unclear. To address this, researchers used track-density imaging to examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus. They identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed their degree of connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Using a tailored tractography pipeline, they characterized where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Their results provide new insights into how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, this study represents a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in vivo and informs our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.
 The Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is activated upon detection of cytoplasmic dsDNA by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), leading to the activation of inflammasomes and inflammation. STING binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and activates transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-κB), resulting in increased production of type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The cGAS-STING pathway has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis, as mice deficient for PD-associated proteins PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK) and parkin show a STING-mediated inflammatory phenotype.To test whether chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration, a mouse model with heterozygous expression of the STING genetic variant N153S was used. In these mice, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and dopaminergic axon terminals in the striatum were found to have reduced integrity, along with alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation was observed in juvenile mice, preceding the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and was blunted in mice deficient for inflammasomes but not for signaling by type I interferons.These findings demonstrate that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and targeting the STING pathway could be beneficial in PD and further neurodegenerative diseases. However, the interconnected nature of neuroinflammation signaling was highlighted, as Casp1-/- mice showed strong inhibition of inflammasome signaling but incomplete rescue of microglia activation and neurodegeneration. Further studies are needed to delineate the contributions of STING activation within microglia and neurons and to assess the susceptibility of different brain regions and neuron populations to STING-induced damage.
 This study investigates why tumors recur in patients undergoing complete response following immunotherapy, despite the presence of cytotoxic T-cell immunity. Contrary to the widely held belief that tumors escape T-cell immunity through immunoediting, this work demonstrates that tumor cells form unique transient cell-in-cell structures that are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. These structures are mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells and are characterized by the inner cells maintaining their integrity and viability while the outer cells are often killed. The discovery of this resistance mechanism reveals a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and highlights the need for further research to develop strategies to overcome it. The study was conducted using mouse models and human samples, and the results suggest that this biological process is a central mechanism through which tumor cells evade T-cell immunity and give rise to relapsed tumors.
 This study investigated the cognitive abilities of marmosets, a highly social primate species, in processing Theory of Mind (ToM) animations using eye tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study compared the gaze patterns and brain activations of marmosets and humans while observing Frith-Happé animations, which feature two triangles moving in different conditions: ToM (mental state attribution), Goal-Directed (GD), and Random.The results showed that both humans and marmosets exhibited longer fixations on the large red triangle during ToM animations compared to other conditions. However, humans also allocated more time to the red triangle in GD animations, while marmosets did not show any difference between GD and Random animations. Both species spent the same proportion of time looking at the small blue triangle in all conditions.Functional imaging studies revealed that the observation of ToM compared to Random animations activated extensive and comparable brain networks in both humans and marmosets, including areas typically associated with social cognition. However, humans showed stronger activations in the left hemisphere, while marmosets displayed stronger activations in the right hemisphere.These findings suggest that marmosets, like humans, differentiate between ToM and non-ToM scenarios, but their gaze behavior and neural activations indicate a distinct processing strategy. This study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities and sheds light on potential similarities and differences in ToM processing between marmosets and humans.
 In the fly larval brain, neuroblast lineages provide an excellent in vivo paradigm for investigating gene regulation during developmental transitions. Neuroblasts are the stem cells that generate all the neurons and glia in the larval and adult brain. During neurogenesis, neuroblasts undergo asymmetric division to produce a sibling progeny that commits to generating differentiated cell types. The type II neuroblast lineage, which generates an immature intermediate neural progenitor (immature INP) in every division, is particularly well-suited for mechanistic investigations.Immature INPs initiate INP commitment 60 minutes after asymmetric neuroblast division. During this process, Notch signaling activity is terminated, and the master regulator of INP commitment, earmuff (erm), is activated. The transcription factors FruitlessC (FruC) and FruitlessB (FruB) have been shown to play a role in INP commitment. However, the fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate stemness gene transcription in neuroblasts are not well understood.In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify genes that contribute to the generation of diverse differentiated cell types during neurogenesis. They found that FruC is the predominant Fru isoform expressed in neuroblasts and that it binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in type II neuroblasts, including Notch and its downstream-effector genes that promote stemness in neuroblasts.The authors also found that FruC negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. Identical to fruC loss-of-function, reducing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) activity increases stemness gene activity. These findings suggest that low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.The authors propose that FruC-PRC2-H3K27me3 molecular pathway fine-tunes stemness gene expression in neuroblasts by promoting low-level H3K27me3 enrichment in their cis-regulatory elements. This mechanism is likely to be relevant throughout metazoans.In summary, this study provides new insights into the fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate stemness gene transcription in neuroblasts during developmental transitions. The authors demonstrate that FruC binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in type II neuroblasts and that it negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. These findings suggest that the FruC-PRC2-H3K27me3 molecular pathway fine-tunes stemness gene expression in neuroblasts, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.
 This study reports an unexpected role of neutrophils in the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes under physiological conditions. Contrary to the belief that neutrophils are excluded from apoptotic sites to avoid tissue inflammation, neutrophils were found to be the predominant phagocytes responsible for the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes in an immunologically silent manner. Neutrophils penetrate apoptotic hepatocytes and clear them from the inside, a process termed perforocytosis. Defects in neutrophil-mediated apoptotic clearance have been observed in human autoimmune liver disease, suggesting a role of neutrophils in maintaining tissue homeostasis. The study also found that neutrophils are attracted to apoptotic hepatocytes by cytokines and chemokines secreted by apoptotic cells, specifically IL-1β and IL-8. Inhibition of selectins, but not PECAM, abrogated the neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes, indicating selectins play a critical role during this process. Neutrophil depletion impaired the prompt clearance of apoptotic cells in the mouse liver, leading to an increase in apoptotic bodies and autoantibodies, suggesting a role of defective neutrophil-mediated removal of apoptotic bodies in autoimmune liver disease. Overall, this study adds to the repertoire of other known functions of neutrophils and has implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
 In this study, researchers investigated the spatial organization of premotor interneurons controlling flexion and extension of the ankle in the spinal cord using rabies virus tracing techniques. Contrary to previous expectations, they found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains. This finding challenges the notion that motor instructions are processed in a spatially organized manner among the flexor-extensor circuit components.The researchers used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice to minimize systematic biases associated with each method. They found that the identity and number of starter cells, which are the main determinants of reproducibility in rabies tracing experiments, are difficult to precisely determine using the methods discussed here. However, they noted that muscle identity of infected motor neurons can be inferred by their stereotyped position in the spinal cord.The researchers also noted that the presence of a small number of 'ectopic' motor neurons, which are seen only following high titre injections, does not significantly contribute to the tracing results. They suggested that these 'ectopic' motor neurons likely represent recurrently connected presynaptic motor neurons.The researchers emphasized the importance of full appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach for mapping premotor circuits and interpreting the results obtained. They concluded that despite using five different methods, they have not been able to find evidence that spinal premotor interneurons innervating flexor vs extensor motor neurons are segregated.
 This study aimed to investigate the relationship between respiration, neural activity, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) signals in anesthetized rats. The researchers found that respiration was associated with gamma-band neural oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and gamma-band power in the electrophysiological signal. This respiration-related gamma activity was tightly linked to the rsfMRI signal, as shown by a strong correlation between the gamma power-derived rsfMRI correlation map and the ACC resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) seedmap.Furthermore, the researchers identified a respiration-related rsfMRI network involving key brain regions controlling respiration, such as the piriform cortex, and regions involved in the rodent default mode network (DMN), including the ACC, medial prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, retrosplenial cortex, primary somatosensory cortices, and hippocampus. This network was mediated by gamma-band neural activity, as shown by a decrease in the respiration-related rsfMRI network when gamma power was regressed out.Additionally, the researchers confirmed that the neural activity played a necessary role in the respiration-related rsfMRI network by experimentally silencing the neural activity in the whole brain while maintaining the respiration in the rat. At the isoelectric state, the LFP amplitude and power were close to zero, and rsfMRI data exhibited a flat, noise-like power distribution and no meaningful ACC RSFC.The researchers also distinguished the respiration-related neural network from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts by obtaining the artifactual patterns of fast and slow respiration signals in the rsfMRI data. They found that the slow respiration-related rsfMRI artifact was distinct from the respiration-related neural network, as it was dominantly located around the ventricles and large veins, whereas the respiration-related neural network was mostly located at the gray matter with a distinct spatial pattern.Overall, this study provides new insights into the relationships between respiration, neural activity, and rsfMRI signals and opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between these factors in both healthy and diseased conditions.
 This study investigated how prey profitability influences the foraging strategies of greater mouse-eared bats, a wild predator that primarily gleanes ground-dwelling arthropods but also has the ability to hawk aerial prey. Using miniaturized biologging devices and DNA metabarcoding of feces, the researchers found that bats use two foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures but vastly different success ratios: gleaning (30%) and hawking (76%). However, due to the larger size of ground prey, 85% of the nightly food acquisition comes from ground prey despite the lower success rates. The bats predominantly use the same foraging strategy on a given night, suggesting that they adapt their hunting behavior to weather and ground conditions. The results demonstrate that these bats use high risk-high gain gleaning of ground prey as a primary foraging tactic but switch to aerial hunting when environmental changes reduce the profitability of ground prey, highlighting the importance of prey switching in covering energy intake even in specialized predators.
 This study aimed to provide quantitative phylogenetic perspectives on hand preferences in monkeys, apes, and humans by analyzing data from 1786 individuals from 38 species and 22 generas of anthropoid primates. The study used the tube task paradigm to assess hand preferences and classified subjects into two age categories: adults and subadults. The data showed that humans display unparalleled right-handedness among primates, but this difference is in direction and not strength. The human condition is characterized by strong individual hand preferences, which is not the case for other primates. The study found that hand preference strength is generally weaker in juveniles compared to adults and that subadult non-human hominoids are notably stronger left-handed than adults. However, none of the hypotheses on primate handedness, including the postural origins hypothesis (POH), tool use, and brain size hypotheses, were unambiguously corroborated by the data. The study suggests that future research should focus more on manual lateralization strength rather than direction to address the phylogenetic patterns described herein. The data were analyzed using R and the phytools package, and the results showed that lateralization strength has a strong phylogenetic signal among anthropoids, while lateralization direction is more uniform across the anthropoid radiation. The study also found that human right-handedness is unparalleled among primates, but humans only deviate markedly from all other taxa in direction and not in strength of lateralization for bimanual manipulation. The study emphasizes that humans are highly deviant among predominately terrestrial primates in displaying such strong individual hand preferences. The study did not find notable influences of foraging-related tool use or absolute brain size on hand preferences. The study's limitations include the binary coding of ecology, the lack of functional equivalence between different bimanual testing schemes, and the limitations of the phylogenetic modelling approach. The study concludes that the evolutionary underpinnings of handedness expression in humans remain enigmatic.
 Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, hypersocial phenotype, and cardiovascular abnormalities. There are currently no pharmacological treatments for the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a role in cognitive and cardiovascular function, is a potential therapeutic target for this syndrome.In this study, researchers analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation on key phenotypes relevant to WBS. CD mice displayed a hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids.Subchronic (10 days) treatment with JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Notably, JZL184 treatment also improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results suggest that modulation of the ECS is a promising novel therapeutic approach for improving key phenotypic alterations in WBS.
 Animal development involves a series of morphologically and molecularly distinct stages, from embryogenesis to adulthood. In holometabolous insects like Drosophila melanogaster, this process includes larva, pupa, and adult stages. The larval stage is characterized by growth and moulting, while the pupal stage is marked by the elimination of larval tissues and the formation of adult structures. The sequential expression of transcription factors, including chinmo, Br-C, and E93, plays a crucial role in determining the identity of these developmental stages.Chinmo is a transcription factor that promotes growth in larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. Its absence during metamorphosis is critical for proper adult differentiation. Interestingly, Br-C and E93 act as tumour suppressors, while chinmo is known to be a pro-oncogene. The function of chinmo as a juvenile specifier is conserved in hemimetabolous insects like Blattella germanica.Chinmo is expressed during embryogenesis and early larval development and is strongly downregulated from L3. Depletion of chinmo using an RNAi transgene results in developmental arrest at the end of the first instar larval stage, with a tanned cuticle and precocious pupal cuticle gene expression. In the salivary glands, depletion of chinmo causes a dramatic decrease in normal larval development, while in the tracheal system, it results in a reduction in nuclear size and DNA content of tracheal cells and a reduced length of the organ. In contrast, depletion of chinmo in imaginal tissues, such as the wing imaginal discs and eye imaginal discs, strongly impedes their larval development.The regulatory interactions of Chinmo with the other temporal specifiers, Br-C and E93, were examined by measuring their expression in chinmo-depleted salivary glands and wing discs. Contrary to previous reports, both tissues showed a significant and premature increase of Br-C protein levels as early as in L1 larvae, while no increase in E93 protein levels was detected in any tissue. Precocious upregulation of Br-C blocked development in both tissues, phenocopying the loss of function of chinmo. Depletion of chinmo and Br-C in salivary glands and wing discs revealed that while salivary glands showed the same growth impairment observed upon chinmo depletion, depletion of Br-C largely rescued the abnormalities in the wing discs caused by depletion of chinmo.In summary, Chinmo is required during the larval period to control the development and function of larval and imaginal tissues. Its absence by the end of larval development is required for the transition to the prepupa and then to allow terminal adult differentiation during the pupal period. The results suggest that a major regulatory function of chinmo during early larval development in imaginal cells is channelled through the repression of Br-C, while in larval tissues, chinmo appears to exert an active role promoting growth and maturation. The functional and expression data reported above show that Chinmo acts as a larval specifier in Drosophila.
 Cycling of co-substrates, where a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions, is a ubiquitous feature in metabolism. While well-known energy and electron carriers like ATP and NAD(P)H act as cycled co-substrates, there are also other metabolites that perform this role in various parts of central metabolism. In this study, a mathematical framework is developed to analyze the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux.Using a single reaction and linear pathways as examples, it is found that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct from the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalyzing that reaction. This limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. By regulating these two parameters, flux dynamics can be controlled in branched and coupled pathways.Existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from central carbon metabolism were analyzed, revealing several reactions that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. The limitations imposed by co-substrate cycling provide experimentally testable hypotheses on specific metabolic phenotypes.In conclusion, measuring and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells. Co-substrate cycling, in general, and co-substrate cycling specifically, could provide a key design feature in cell metabolism, imposing certain constraints or dynamical properties.
 The study identified NFATc1 as a crucial regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation during development, as NFATc1-expressing cells generated almost all articular chondrocytes but not chondrocytes in the growth-plate primordium. NFATc1-expressing cells displayed prominent capacities for colony formation and multipotent differentiation, and transcriptome analyses revealed a set of characteristic genes in NFATc1-enriched articular cartilage progenitors. The expression of NFATc1 was diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppressing NFATc1 expression in articular cartilage progenitors was sufficient to induce spontaneous chondrogenesis while overexpressing NFATc1 suppresses chondrogenesis. Mechanistically, NFATc1 negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene, indicating that NFATc1 characterizes articular, but not growth-plate, cartilage progenitors and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation at least partly through regulating COL2A1 gene transcription. However, there are some limitations to the study, including the need for further exploration of the detailed molecular mechanism of NFATc1 regulating articular chondrocyte differentiation and the origin of NFATc1+ articular cartilage progenitors.
 Photosystem II (PSII) is a key enzyme in oxygenic photosynthesis, responsible for water oxidation and plastoquinone reduction. The near-universal type of PSII contains 35 chlorophylls a (Chl-a) and 2 pheophytins a (Phe), with Chl-d and Chl-f being found in some cyanobacterial PSII variants. Chl-d and Chl-f replace some of the Chl-a in the reaction centre, allowing for the use of lower energy, far-red light. However, it was predicted that these far-red PSII variants would lose photochemical efficiency and/or resilience to photodamage due to the diminished energy available.In this study, the enzyme turnover efficiency, forward reactions, and back-reactions were compared in Chl-a-PSII, Chl-d-PSII from Acaryochloris marina, and Chl-f-PSII from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis. The results showed that:1. All types of PSII have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover.2. The modified energy gaps on the acceptor side of Chl-d-PSII favour recombination via PD1+Phe- repopulation, leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII.3. The acceptor-side energy gaps in Chl-f-PSII are tuned to avoid harmful back reactions, favouring resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage.The differences in the redox tuning of the electron transfer cofactors Phe and QA and in the number and layout of the chlorophylls that share the excitation energy with the primary electron donor explain the distinct adaptations of Chl-d-PSII and Chl-f-PSII to lower energy environments, each with different functional penalties.
 This study investigated the role of osteocytes in regulating bone and bone marrow homeostasis by examining the effects of osteocyte ablation on bone tissue development and postnatal maturation. The researchers used a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes by expressing diphtheria toxin subunit α in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)-positive osteocytes. The results showed that partial ablation of osteocytes caused impairment of osteogenesis and lymphopoiesis, and increased osteoclastogenesis and mobilization of myelopoiesis toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes. These changes resulted in severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan.Further analysis revealed that osteocytes regulate bone and bone marrow lineage cell specification through the acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells. The researchers suggest that this may be an underlying cause of the accelerated skeletal aging phenotype. The study also showed that sarcopenia usually occurs concurrently with osteoporosis during aging, and that osteocyte ablation caused severe sarcopenia and muscle atrophy.The researchers also found that osteocytes regulate myelopoiesis via Gsα-dependent and -independent signaling and secrete factors such as sclerostin and RANKL to regulate bone metabolism. However, the results demonstrated that osteocyte ablation impaired osteogenesis and induced osteoclastogenesis, despite a reduction in sclerostin expression and an increase in serum RANKL.The study also showed that senescence in osteoprogenitors and myeloid lineage cells led to the impaired osteogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis, respectively. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that senescent osteoprogenitors have reduced self-renewal capacity and predominantly differentiate into adipocytes as opposed to osteoblasts, and that fat-induction factors inhibit osteogenesis during adipogenesis.The researchers also found that even under in vitro conditions, impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogenesis were still observed in osteoprogenitors and bone marrow-derived macrophisms, suggesting that these cells have been primed by the altered bone microenvironment in DTAhet mice before in vitro differentiation.In conclusion, this study demonstrated that osteocytes play a critical role in regulating senescence of bone and bone marrow, and that osteocyte ablation induced SASP accumulation in bone marrow osteoprogenitors and myeloid lineage cells, which altered MSC and HSC lineage commitments with impaired osteogenesis and promoted myelopoiesis and osteoclastogenesis, leading to the accelerated skeletal aging phenotype with severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, degenerative kyphosis, and bone marrow myelopoiesis, thus shortened lifespan. Targeting osteocyte function and cell fate may shed light on the therapeutic regimens for aging-associated bone diseases.
 The long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) of Escherichia coli provides a model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations despite the redundancy of genomic changes leading to similar phenotypic and fitness effects. Researchers characterized the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes in 12 replicate populations after 50,000 generations. They found that all evolved lines have more mRNAs, and this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. Despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations have remarkably similar gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The majority of expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level, with very few translational changes. Mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.
 This study investigates the role of CD133, a marker widely associated with cancer stem cells and drug resistance, during mouse liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy (PHx). In Shp2-deficient livers, actively dividing hepatocytes formed distinctive clusters and highly expressed CD133 but were negative for other stem/progenitor cell markers. CD133 expression was upregulated by proliferative signal inhibition in various cancer cell lines, and isolated CD133+ intracellular vesicles were enriched with mRNAs rather than miRNAs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed lower intracellular transcriptional diversity in Shp2-deficient cells, which was potentially remedied in CD133+ cells through intercellular mRNA exchanges. CD133-deficient cells were more sensitive to proliferative signal inhibition in livers and intestinal organoids. These findings suggest a mechanism of intercellular communication to compensate for intracellular signal deficit in various cell types.
 This study aimed to identify drug candidates for maintaining photoreceptor survival in retinal ciliopathies, specifically LCA10, using an organoid-based high-throughput screening platform. The study used rd16 mouse iPSC-derived retinal organoids, which showed compromised photoreceptor development and viability, as a primary screen. An FDA-approved small molecule drug, reserpine, was identified as an efficacious lead compound that also enhanced photoreceptor development and survival in LCA10 patient iPSC-derived retinal organoids and in the rd16 retina in vivo.Transcriptomic analyses of drug-treated patient organoids indicated modulation of cell survival pathways including p53 and proteostasis by reserpine. Further examination revealed dysregulation of autophagy in patient organoids and rd16 retina, and partial restoration of proteostasis and improved ciliogenesis after reserpine treatment. The study establishes a cross-species drug discovery pipeline using organoid-based HTS and identifies a repurposing drug candidate for maintaining photoreceptor survival in LCA10 patients. Additionally, reserpine and its derivatives could potentially serve as effective treatments for other retinal ciliopathies due to the common impact of proteostasis dysregulation on these diseases.
 In this study, the researchers investigated the role of honey bees and their microbiota in the metabolism of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in almond trees and other plants. They found that both the host and the microbiota contribute to the degradation of amygdalin.The researchers first confirmed that amygdalin can be metabolized by both bees and members of their gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In contrast, in microbiota-colonized bees, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut.The researchers also identified specific strains of Bifidobacterium, Bombilactobacillus, and Gilliamella that can degrade amygdalin. They found that the degradation mechanism varies between strains, with some producing prunasin as an intermediate and others not.Furthermore, they identified a highly expressed enzyme belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3) in amygdalin-grown cultures of Bifidobacterium strain wkB204. This enzyme is likely involved in the degradation of amygdalin and prunasin.The researchers also investigated the impact of amygdalin on honey bee health and found that concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mM did not affect bee survival rates or microbiota composition and did not deter bees. However, dietary amygdalin can reduce parasite and viral loads in honey bees.Overall, this study sheds light on the complex interactions between honey bees, their microbiota, and the plant compounds they encounter in their diet. It highlights the importance of considering both the host and the microbiota when studying the metabolism and health effects of dietary compounds in insects.
 Candida albicans causes severe invasive candidiasis, which requires the virulence factor candidalysin (CL) for membrane damage. CL uses a unique mechanism to form membrane pores by pre-assembling into a pore-competent loop conformation in solution. The assembly of CL into an insertion-competent state in solution may provide an infectivity advantage for C. albicans, and could also be a potential therapeutic opportunity to inhibit CL pore formation. The oligomeric state of the basic assembly unit is proposed to be a CL 8-mer, and future studies are expected to shed light on the specific reasons behind the disparate effects of mutations and determine if CL pore formation is indeed under kinetic control. Wild-type and variant CL were synthesized and characterized using mass spectrometry, ion mobility measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed to determine the molecular weight and size of CL in solution. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of CL in the presence and absence of lipid bilayers. AFM imaging was performed to observe CL pores in lipid bilayers and to investigate the effect of mutations on CL pore formation. The data suggest that CL forms membrane pores by pre-assembling into a pore-competent loop conformation in solution, and that this mechanism may be a potential therapeutic target to inhibit CL pore formation.
 Precision medicine, which tailors interventions to patients' genetic, biological, and behavioral markers, holds promise for improved health outcomes. However, the effectiveness of personalized interventions may not solely be due to their pharmacological ingredients; contextual factors, such as the therapeutic interaction and placebo effects, may also contribute significantly. This study aimed to test whether framing a sham treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness by recruiting 102 adults to receive painful heat stimulations on their forearm. Participants were told either that the machine was personalized to their genetics and physiology or that it was effective in reducing pain generally. The results showed that participants in the personalized group reported greater relief in pain intensity and unpleasantness than the control group in both the feasibility study and the pre-registered double-blind confirmatory study. Several personality traits moderated the results. These findings provide evidence that framing a placebo treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness and could potentially improve the methodology of precision medicine research and inform practice. The study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council and Genome Québec.Contextual factors, such as the therapeutic interaction and placebo effects, may significantly influence the effectiveness of personalized interventions in precision medicine. While the role of contextual factors in precision medicine remains unexplored, research in placebo science suggests that contextual factors, such as verbal suggestions, patient expectations, social cues, and observational learning, can increase the effectiveness of inactive treatments and placebo effects of real treatments for both subjective and physiological symptoms. The public's high expectations, increased trust, and preference for uniqueness in precision medicine may also contribute to placebo effects. Providing genetic and physiological feedback and using it to tailor treatments may similarly influence outcomes for precision therapies. The appeal to individuality and the personalization process may also implicitly suggest stronger perceived treatment effectiveness by harnessing factors known to increase the placebo effect. However, the influence of the personalization process on perceived treatment effectiveness is largely unknown. Therefore, this study tested whether believing that a treatment is tailored to one's physiology and genetics may improve its perceived efficacy. The study found that participants using the machine presented as personalized reported nearly twice the reduction in pain intensity and unpleasantness as those in the control group. These findings could potentially optimize contextual factors in precision medicine and inform clinical practice.In conclusion, this study provides evidence that framing a placebo treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness and could potentially optimize contextual factors in precision medicine. The findings could have implications beyond the field of precision medicine and healthcare, as individual tailoring is increasingly becoming the focus of consumer products and experiences. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms of action and optimize contextual factors in the delivery of personalized treatments.
 Shared lineage has diverse effects on neuronal circuitry in various model systems. In the zebrafish spinal cord, sister V2a (NotchOFF) and V2b (NotchON) neurons arise from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and have somata in close proximity and similar axonal trajectories. However, electrophysiological analyses reveal that these sister neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. This divergent connectivity resembles the Notch-differentiated sister neurons in Drosophila and represents the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.In both zebrafish and mice, vsx1+ progenitors give rise to two distinct daughter populations, V2a and V2b neurons. Using a stochastic labeling approach, we successfully labeled clonally related V2 neurons in zebrafish spinal cord but required a chx10 co-label to properly identify vsx1 pairs as V2a/b neurons in vivo. Sister V2a/b neurons are located in close proximity to each other during larval stages, but their axons exhibit different morphological characteristics. Sister V2a neurons have axons that are on average 61% longer than their V2b counterparts due to Notch expression attenuating axon growth. However, there is no relationship between axon length and location along the rostral-caudal axis.To assess axon proximity, we calculated the shortest distance between the V2b and V2a axon along each point of the V2b neuron. Clonally related V2a/b neurons send axons along a similar trajectory, with a median of 37.1% of the V2b axon length within 5 µm of the V2a axon. This suggests a possibility for sister V2a/b neurons to contact shared synaptic targets. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology in voltage clamp from clonally related pairs of V2a/b neurons revealed little to no synchronous synaptic input. Non-sister V2a/b neurons from the same segment also receive input from distinct synaptic sources.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that sister V2a/b neurons develop and remain close to each other during larval stages but do not form synaptic connections with each other or with shared downstream targets. This suggests that developmental timing and divergent cellular identities may determine neuronal connectivity in the spinal cord. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the integration of Notch-differentiated sister neurons into distinct circuits.
