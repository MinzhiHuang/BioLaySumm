 Burkholderia thailandensis, an environmental isolate, exhibits genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity due to a phase variation system driven by RecA-mediated homologous recombination between IS2-like elements. This system allows the bacterium to adapt quickly to environments demanding different lifestyles, such as planktonic and biofilm growth. The IS elements provide homologous sequences for amplification of a chromosomal region containing 157 genes, which promotes biofilm formation when present in multiple copies and enhances planktonic growth with a single copy. The presence of two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region in the chromosome results in a heterogeneous population, optimized for either planktonic or sessile growth, representing a bet-hedging strategy for population survival in fluctuating environments. This phase variation system likely evolved through the acquisition of ISα and ISβ elements.
 The rate and accuracy of translation in bacteria hinges on multiple components, including transfer RNA (tRNA) pools, tRNA modifying enzymes, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. While redundancy in these components is hypothesized to evolve under selection driven by its impacts on growth rate, empirical measurements of the fitness costs and benefits of redundancy are lacking. In this study, researchers manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of Escherichia coli by deleting 28 tRNA genes, 3 tRNA modifying systems, and 4 rRNA operons in various combinations.They found that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful but costly under nutrient limitation. This nutrient-dependent cost of redundant tRNA genes stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate, and therefore varies as a function of the maximum growth rate attainable in a given nutrient niche. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. Importantly, these effects are contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing.The results suggest both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species' evolutionary history with feasts and famines. The fitness costs and benefits of redundancy should ultimately be shaped by nutrient availability, but redundancy may itself arise via different mechanisms for different translation components, and hence selection may shape the components in distinct ways. For instance, with rRNAs, the loss of GCN redundancy is buffered by strong compensatory upregulation of 'backup' gene copies. However, tRNA pools are not similarly regulated, and the impacts of redundancy on growth rate and other growth parameters vary across different tRNA genes and growth media. Further studies are needed to fully understand the evolution and impacts of redundancy in translation components.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented increase in sequencing data for SARS-CoV-2, making existing tools for exploring phylogenies inadequate for handling the large datasets. Taxonium is a new web-based tool that uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser, making it the first tool to enable the interactive examination of such large phylogenies. Taxonium supports mutation-annotated trees, which capture all known genetic variation in a dataset, and can be run entirely locally, from a server-based backend, or as a desktop application.Taxonium provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution by allowing the exploration of a tree of over five million sequences. It also offers a public tree of more than five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences for exploration at cov2tree.org. Taxonium can be applied to any tree and is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium.Genomic researchers responded to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 by collaborating at an unprecedented scale, generating open protocols for amplicon sequencing and storing the resulting datasets in the INSDC databases and GISAID. The fundamental representation of a viral epidemic for genomic epidemiology is a phylogenetic tree, which approximates the transmission tree and allows insights into the direction of migration of viral lineages.The construction of phylogenetic trees and the visualization of these trees have been major bottlenecks preventing full-scale analyses. Two broad responses to this issue are downsampling the sequences or developing new tools that operate on large datasets directly without downsampling. Taxonium is an example of the latter approach, allowing for the exploration of large trees with millions of nodes in a responsive and efficient manner.
 This study demonstrates that RNA elements, specifically PRRE motifs and a GA-rich element in the 3′ UTR of the mouse Net1 RNA, regulate RNA localization in both epithelial and neuronal cells. The findings suggest that these elements specify that an RNA should be trafficked to the plus end of microtubules, wherever that may be in a given cell type, opening up the possibility of predicting the localization of an RNA in a given cell type if its localization in another cell type is known. The study also reveals that RP mRNAs, which are enriched in neurites and the basal pole of epithelial cells, are trafficked to these locations through the action of kinesin motor proteins. The results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying RNA trafficking and suggest that similar mechanisms operate in different cell types and species. The study was conducted using C2bbe1, HCA-7, MDCK cells, and CAD neuronal cells. The researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 to integrate a loxP-flanked blasticidin resistance cassette into the AAVS1 safe harbor of C2bbe1 and HCA-7 cells, and cre-mediated recombination to switch on doxycycline-inducible expression of transgenes and reporter transcripts. Halo-seq was used to assay RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of C2bbe1 monolayers, and the results showed that apical-Halo and basal-Halo fusion proteins produced less biotinylated RNA than the cytoplasmic-Halo fusion but recovered significantly more RNA following streptavidin pulldown from cells treated with DBF than control untreated cells. The study also identified 1192 genes that were significantly cytoplasmically enriched and 715 genes that were significantly depleted in the cytoplasm, and lncRNAs had significantly lower CB values, indicating that Halo-seq was faithfully reporting on RNA localization in C2bbe1 cells. The study also found that LARP1 mediates the basal localization of PRRE-containing RNAs in epithelial monolayers and the neurite localization of the same RNAs in neuronal cells. The findings suggest that the RNA contents of both locations are determined at least in part through microtubule plus-end directed trafficking mechanisms. The study also found that a GA-rich region in the 3′ UTR of the mouse Net1 RNA is necessary and sufficient to drive RNAs both to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells and the basal pole of human epithelial cells. The study also found that a GA-rich region in the 3′ UTR of human NET1 RNA was also identified as necessary for the localization of the transcript to the leading edges of migrating cells, dependent on transport by KIF1C. Overall, the study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying RNA trafficking and suggests that similar mechanisms operate in different cell types and species.
 Aging is a complex process associated with various phenotypic changes at the cellular and tissue levels, including genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, chronic low-level inflammation (inflammaging), immunosenescence, and impaired regeneration. Some studies suggest that an increase in transcriptional noise is a hallmark of aging. However, the relationship between aging and transcriptional noise remains unclear, and previous analyses have been confounded by various factors, including computational methods and biological sources of variability.To systematically compare the most important families of methods used to quantify age-related transcriptional noise, the authors developed Decibel, a Python toolkit. Decibel implements four commonly used methods for quantifying age-related transcriptional noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data: biological variation over technical variation, gene-based Euclidean distance, Euclidean distance to the cell type mean using invariant genes, and global coordination level (GCL).Additionally, the authors developed Scallop, a novel computational method for quantifying membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. Cells with a greater Scallop membership score are transcriptionally more stable. Application of these computational tools to seven aging datasets showed large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging.The authors also investigated cell type-specific effects on transcriptional noise by focusing on the aging lung. They found that club cells and interstitial fibroblasts showed increased transcriptional noise, while alveolar macrophages seemed to decrease it. However, a single-cell analysis of alveolar macrophages did not identify distinct clusters associated with mouse or human aging, suggesting that changes in the aged alveolar microenvironment are key for their altered functionalities.In humans, they analyzed two aging lung datasets and found no consistency between the two datasets regarding transcriptional noise of the 30 specific cell types detected. However, both in human and mouse lungs, they detected a shift in the abundance of a number of cell populations with age, most clearly seen for immune cells. The age-associated increase in immune cell infiltration of solid organs may be generalized.The authors suggest that the sources of the apparent increase in transcriptional noise reported by previous studies may be multiple and are mostly related to the computational methods used to characterize transcriptional noise and cellular identity in aged tissues. They propose that Scallop, which measures transcriptional noise by membership to cell type-specific clusters, is a better choice for measuring loss of cell type identity compared to DTC methods.In summary, the authors' results suggest that transcriptional noise is not a bona fide hallmark of aging. Instead, they posit that previous analyses of noise in aging scRNAseq datasets have been confounded by various factors, including both computational methods used for analysis and other biology-driven sources of variability. The open availability of Decibel and Scallop represents an opportunity for the aging research community to further investigate these issues.
 Tumour heterogeneity is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment due to the presence of drug-resistant clonal lineages. Identifying the characteristics of these lineages that underpin resistance to therapy has remained challenging. In this study, clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq (Wholistic Interrogation of Lineage Dynamics by sequencing) was used to understand response and resistance to therapy, including BET bromodomain inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy, in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).WILD-seq utilizes a lentiviral library to label cells with an expressed, heritable barcode that enables identification of clonal lineage in conjunction with single-cell RNA sequencing. The platform was optimized to ensure recurrent representation of clonal lineages across animals and samples, facilitating analysis of clonal dynamics under the selective pressure of therapeutic intervention.Analysis of response of TNBC models to frontline taxane-based chemotherapy revealed an enrichment of clones with high levels of NRF2 signaling, implicating defense against oxidative damage as a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. These NRF2-high, taxane-resistant lineages were found to be collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation as a result of L-asparaginase treatment and adapted to this second-line intervention by up-regulating de novo asparagine synthesis.These findings demonstrate the utility of WILD-seq for identifying mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy that are also operative in patients and pinpointing asparagine bioavailability as a druggable vulnerability of taxane-resistant lineages. The platform can be applied to other cancer types and therapeutic interventions to gain a deeper understanding of tumour evolution and response to treatment.
 DMRT1 is a testis-determining factor in several species of vertebrates, but its role in mammalian testes differentiation is ambiguous. In mammals, SRY is the testis-determining gene, but DMRT1 has roles in both germ cells and supporting cells in the testis. In the rabbit, DMRT1 is required for testis differentiation since XY DMRT1−/− rabbits show early male-to-female sex reversal with differentiating ovaries and complete female genitalia. However, germ cells failed to undergo meiosis, and follicles did not form in XY and XX DMRT1−/− mutant ovaries, leading to female infertility. DMRT1 is also crucial for female fertility, as XX DMRT1−/− adult females were sterile. These phenotypes indicate an evolutionary continuum between non-mammalian vertebrates and non-rodent mammals. Additionally, DMRT1 mutations have been linked to human pathologies such as Disorders of Sex Development and male and female infertility. The rabbit model was chosen to further investigate DMRT1 functions in non-rodent mammals, and a DMRT1 knock-out line was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The results confirmed that DMRT1 is a testis-determining factor in mammals and is also required for female fertility.
 Obesity, a global epidemic disease, is caused by the accumulation of excessive or abnormal amounts of fat, which poses a significant threat to health. High-fat diets (HFDs) are a leading contributor to obesity and are responsible for approximately 2.5 million deaths yearly. Understanding the mechanism of obesity requires careful consideration of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Drosophila, a simplified model of metabolic diseases, has emerged as an effective tool for investigating lipid metabolism and homeostasis.CTPS, an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of CTP, is crucial for regulating body weight and starvation resistance in Drosophila. HFD-induced obesity leads to increased transcription of CTPS and elongates cytoophidia in larval adipocytes. Depleting CTPS in the fat body prevents HFD-induced obesity, including body weight gain, adipocyte expansion, and lipid accumulation, by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis. Additionally, a dominant-negative form of CTPS also prevents adipocyte expansion and downregulates lipogenic genes.CTPS is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of amide nitrogen from glutamine to the C-4 position of UTP, requiring ATP. It can form filamentous structures called cytoophidia, which are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. CTPS cytoophidia have several functions, including modulation of enzymatic activity, maintenance of cell morphology, and stabilization of CTPS protein. They have been found in several human cancers, indicating their potential role in maintaining tissue homeostasis.The Drosophila fat body, an organ with high metabolic activity and conserved signaling pathways, plays a crucial role in sensing nutritional conditions and responding through the integration of lipid metabolism. Our study reveals that HFD feeding results in an upregulation of CTPS transcription and an elongation of CTPS cytoophidia in the fat body. CTPS depletion in adipose tissue leads to decreased body weight and increased susceptibility to starvation during food deprivation. The absence of cytoophidia, as the result of reduced CTPS expression or the expression of a dominant-negative mutant CTPS protein, leads to a reduction in HFD-induced adipocyte expansion and TAG level, strongly supporting the role of cytoophidia in adipocyte growth and lipogenesis in response to HFD.In summary, our study provides evidence for the essential role of CTPS in regulating adipocyte growth and lipid metabolism in Drosophila through the activation of the PI3K-Akt-SREBP pathway. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether this mechanism is also present in mammalian adipose tissue and in other tissues, such as the liver. A more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between diverse cellular processes in maintaining lipid homeostasis could lead to the advancement of knowledge regarding metabolic disorders and energy homeostasis.
 During vertebrate embryogenesis, the germ layers are patterned by secreted Nodal signals, which bind to a complex comprising Type I/II Activin receptors and the co-receptor Tdgf1. In zebrafish, three Type I (Acvr1) and four Type II (Acvr2) homologs were identified, and all receptor-encoding transcripts were found to be maternally deposited and present during embryogenesis. Loss of individual receptor function did not cause obvious patterning defects, but severe patterning phenotypes and embryonic lethality were observed with combinatorial loss of putative Type II Acvr receptors. The Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b were identified as the main mediators of Nodal signaling in zebrafish. Feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors were found to directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.
 Type I interferon (IFN-I) responses are crucial for host defense against viral infections, and the production of IFN-I is tightly controlled through cellular decision-making processes. Recent studies have challenged the long-held belief that the initiation of IFN-I production is stochastically regulated, suggesting that host-intrinsic factors play a deterministic role in dictating early IFN-I responses.Using a murine fibroblast reporter model, researchers have investigated the influence of various stochastic and deterministic factors on early IFN-I responses. Epigenetic drugs have been shown to influence the percentage of responding cells, providing evidence for transient heritability driving responder fates. The Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test has been used to verify the transient nature of this heritability. Additionally, cell density has been found to play a role in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing.Together, these findings open up new avenues for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses, which can be translated to other immune signaling systems. The ability to revise the fundamentals of cellular decision-making has the potential to lead to improved IFN-mediated immune therapies.The study utilized a murine fibroblast model to investigate early IFN-I response dynamics, focusing on the detection of first responding cells and the effects of various host-intrinsic factors on their behavior. The researchers used a NIH3T3:IRF7-CFP reporter cell line to monitor signaling dynamics during the early phase of IFN-I response dynamics, and an unbiased automated image analysis script to detect first responders based on the translocation of fluorescent signal corresponding with IRF7 molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The study also explored the response dynamics using a NIH3T3:STAT1-CFP/STAT2-YFP fibroblast reporter cell line, and investigated the manipulation of cellular decision-making by altering the cells' epigenetic profile.The results showed that the cellular decision to become a first responder is at least partly epigenetically regulated via both methylation and histone acetylation. The study also demonstrated that the fraction of first responders increases upon hypomethylation and activation, and that the classical Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test can reveal a yet unknown, deterministic phenomenon which dictates responsiveness, which seems to overrule stochasticity.Overall, this systems immunology approach highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between stochasticity and determinism in cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses, and the potential implications for other immune signaling systems. The findings pave the way for improved IFN-mediated immune therapies and a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the immune response.
 Microtubules (MTs) are built from α- and β-tubulin heterodimers and serve as tracks for various cellular cargos, including mRNAs, proteins, and organelles. In Drosophila melanogaster, four α-tubulin genes are expressed, with three of them contributing to the formation of microtubules during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Among these, αTub84B and αTub84D are highly similar, while αTub67C is expressed exclusively during oogenesis and has a distinct primary structure. MTs undergo several post-translational modifications (PTMs), including C-terminal tail glutamylation, glycylation, and detyrosination/tyrosination. Glutamylation is a critical PTM that adds one or more glutamic acids to the sidechains of glutamic acid residues in the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin, forming a branched peptide chain.In this study, researchers focused on the role of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of α-tubulins during Drosophila oogenesis. They found that αTub84B and αTub84D are glutamylated at their C-terminal ends, while αTub67C is not. The C-terminal ends of αTub84B and αTub84D contain several glutamyl sidechains in various combinations. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian αTub84B and αTub84D, and its absence leads to the mislocalization of glutamylated microtubules and the disruption of kinesin-1-dependent processes, such as the precise localization of Staufen and fast, bidirectional ooplasmic streaming.Furthermore, TTLL5 plays a role in the nervous system, where its inactivation decreases the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria. Overall, this study demonstrates the in vivo importance of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of α-tubulins and highlights the significance of α-tubulin glutamylation for various cellular functions involving microtubule transport.
 GENESPACE is a computational pipeline designed to address challenges in leveraging information across multiple genomes by integrating conserved gene order and orthology. It utilizes synteny, or the conserved order of DNA sequences among chromosomes that share a common ancestor, to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. GENESPACE has demonstrated utility in various contexts, including studying sex chromosome evolution, grass family diversity, and maize cultivars. It offers significant improvements over existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes. The pipeline operates on a foundational assumption that homologs should be exactly single copy within any syntenic region between a pair of genomes, and addresses complexities such as tandem arrays and gene presence-absence variation. GENESPACE's sensitivity pipeline infers syntenic regions, and it produces a greater percentage of single-copy syntenic blocks and genes in single chromosome orthogroups than other methods. It also outperforms simple integration between methods and provides a more comprehensive view of gene family evolution in various taxa.
 In polymicrobial communities, most bacteria exist and interact with each other, producing unique compounds, increasing virulence, and augmenting antibiotic resistance. One such community associated with negative healthcare outcomes consists of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. When co-cultured, virulence factors secreted by P. aeruginosa reduce metabolism and growth in S. aureus, allowing it to drive S. aureus toward extinction in vitro. However, both species can co-exist in vivo. Previous studies suggest that altered gene expression or mutations may account for this discrepancy, but little is known about how the growth environment influences their co-existence.Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation, researchers have shown that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. They found that changing the carbon source in growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric they call absolute growth. As a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa.The relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. These findings demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species, provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations.In this study, researchers used P. aeruginosa strain PA14 and S. aureus strain RN4220, along with their mutants ΔpqsL, ΔpvdA/ΔpchE, and ΔpqsL/ΔpvdA/ΔpchE. They investigated the effect of different carbon sources on the growth and metabolism of both species and their interactions using a 96-well plate reader and bioluminescent assays. They found that changes in carbon sources led to differences in absolute growth between both bacterial species, which influenced their co-existence.The researchers also used an agent-based model to estimate the trends in spatial overlap (δ) of the two populations under various disturbance conditions. They found that reducing the value of δ, which represents the spatial distribution of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa during disturbance, decreases the effect of these virulence factors on S. aureus. The findings provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, as disturbance at intermediate frequencies facilitates the co-existence of both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, while in continually and undisturbed environments, P. aeruginosa dominated the co-culture.Manipulation of absolute growth using different carbon sources may also serve to rationally increase the efficacy of antibiotics. For example, carbon sources that cause S. aureus to have a significantly greater absolute growth relative to P. aeruginosa would limit the growth of P. aeruginosa, reducing the total concentration of HQNO produced and allowing the metabolism of S. aureus to remain relatively high, promoting the efficacy of antibiotics. Conversely, promoting the production of P. aeruginosa by using carbon sources that increase its absolute growth relative to S. aureus would augment the production of HQNO, increasing the membrane permeability of S. aureus found in biofilms and augmenting sensitivity to certain antibiotics.In summary, the study demonstrates that differences in growth environment can significantly impact the co-existence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, providing insights into the complex interactions between these bacterial species and their role in polymicrobial communities. The findings have implications for understanding the dynamics of bacterial populations in various niches and may offer potential strategies for manipulating their behavior in clinical settings.
 The field of biology is generating an increasing amount of data, particularly in the area of interspecies interactions between diverse groups of species. However, there is a lack of methods for capturing knowledge about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions in a way that is amenable to data-driven research. To address this, a framework has been developed for curating scientific literature on interspecies interactions, using the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base) as a case study.The framework includes a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen–host interaction data at the levels of host, pathogen, strain, gene, and genotype. The concept of a multispecies genotype, or 'metagenotype,' is introduced to facilitate capturing changes in disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility, which can be due to gene alterations.PHI-Canto, a community curation tool, has been developed for use by publication authors. It is an extension of the PomBase Canto tool, which already supports annotating genes from multiple species in the same curation session but could not previously support annotation of interspecies interactions or annotation of genes from naturally occurring strains.The development of curation tools with clear workflows and support for biological ontologies and controlled vocabularies has standardized curation efforts, reduced ambiguity, and improved the maintenance of curated data as biological knowledge evolves. The pathogen–host interaction research community is an example of a domain exhibiting a literature deluge, and PHI-base is an open-access database containing data on bacterial, fungal, and protist genes proven to affect (or not affect) the outcome of pathogen–host interactions. Since 2005, PHI-base has manually curated phenotype data associated with underlying genome-level changes from peer-reviewed pathogen–host interaction literature.The curation of interspecies interactions requires the use of metagenotypes, which represent the combination of a pathogen genotype and a host genotype. Metagenotypes can be annotated with pathogen–host interaction phenotypes to capture changes in pathogenicity and virulence. The curation process involves annotating genes, genotypes, and metagenotypes with terms from controlled vocabularies, including the Pathogen–Host Interaction Phenotype Ontology (PHIPO), and supporting annotations with experimental evidence and conditions.PHI-Canto uses the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) for retrieving protein entities, gene names, and species information for display in PHI-Canto. It also supports the annotation of interspecies interactions using the concept of a metagenotype, which is created after the individual genotypes from both species are created. Each metagenotype can be annotated with pathogen–host interaction phenotypes to capture changes in pathogenicity and virulence.The curation framework described here is a suitable approach for adoption and use by a wide range of research communities in the life sciences focused on different types of interspecies interactions occurring within or across kingdoms in different environments and at multiple scales. The use of stable identifiers, such as those provided by UniProtKB, is essential for annotating entities in curation contexts. PHI-Canto's curation workflows maintain support for nine high-level terms that describe phenotypic outcomes essential for taxonomically diverse interspecies comparisons.The development of PHI-Canto involved addressing several challenges, including recording the delivery mechanism used within the pathogen–host interaction experiment and supporting the annotation of physical interactions between proteins from different species. New experimental condition terms were developed with a prefix of 'delivery mechanism,' and the existing Canto module for curating physical interactions was adapted to support two different species. To support the annotation of phenotypes in PHI-Canto, PHIPO was developed, a species-neutral phenotype ontology that describes a broad range of pathogen–host interaction phenotypes. PHI-Canto also includes a 'disease name' annotation type for annotating the name of the disease caused by an interaction between the pathogen and host specified in a wild-type metagenotype. PHI-Canto's curation process is outlined in Figure 4, and curation tutorials are available on the PHI-base YouTube channel.
 This study utilized F1 hybrids derived from crosses between C57BL/6 J mice and nine inbred mouse lines to identify sequence variants that impact enhancer function. The researchers found that sequence variants within the central ~50 bp of enhancer sequences were most likely to lead to an allele-specific change in enhancer activity. They also observed that AP-1 binding is often required for TEAD TF binding to enhancers, while TEAD is generally dispensable for AP-1 TF binding. The data suggest that enhancer priming/selection and activation are not separable steps mediated by distinct TF-binding events at enhancers in MEFs. The study also revealed that SNPs outside of core TF-binding motifs can collectively modulate enhancer activity. The findings provide new insight into the crosstalk between Ras/MAPK and Hippo/YAP/TAZ/TEAD signal-dependent gene expression and suggest that Ras/MAPK-induced AP-1 can play an instructive role in determining the output of Hippo/YAP/TAZ/TEAD-dependent transcriptional programs.
 This study identifies the dynein activating adaptor NINL as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and a target of viral antagonism. NINL has evolved under recurrent positive selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region, making it unique among dynein, dynactin, and activating adaptor genes. NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in increased permissiveness to viral replication. Proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. These findings reveal the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of host–virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.
 Actin isoforms are essential structural proteins in eukaryotic cells, and despite their high sequence and structure conservation, subtle differences determine their interaction with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins. In this study, high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle α-actin (3.37 Å), cardiac muscle α-actin (3.07 Å), β-actin (2.99 Å), and γ-actin (3.38 Å) in the Mg2+·ADP state with native post-translational modifications were obtained. The structures revealed isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus, which establish isoform-specific interfaces for myosin binding. These structures complement the repertoire of known actin structures and provide insights into the in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms.The structures were determined using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and revealed local resolutions ranging from 2.1 to 3.5 Å for skeletal muscle α-actin, 1.9-3.3 Å for cardiac muscle α-actin, 1.5-3.0 Å for β-actin, and 2.1-4.4 Å for γ-actin. All actin structures were solved without the use of stabilizing drugs. The structures showed that the N-termini of bare muscle and nonmuscle actins have different orientations, contributing to distinct binding interfaces for myosin motors and likely other actin-binding proteins.The actin filament is composed of G-actin protomers that assemble into a double-stranded helix. Each protomer consists of four subdomains (SD1-SD4), and the nucleotide-binding cleft and barbed end groove are formed by SD2 and SD3, respectively. The nucleotide-binding cleft harbors the active site, and the barbed end groove mediates longitudinal interfaces within the actin filament. The longitudinal interface between two adjacent actin protomers involves the extended D-loop located in SD2 of one actin protomer that interacts with amino acids located in SD1 and SD3 of another protomer.The structures of single-isotype actin isoforms revealed subtle differences, including minor differences near the nucleotide-binding cleft that may contribute to the reported differences in the biochemistries of actin isoforms. The comparison of longitudinal and transverse interprotomer interfaces revealed that the transverse interface is more conserved, with only one amino acid substitution (V286/I287) at the intersection of the longitudinal and transverse interfaces. The absence of amino acid substitutions in SD2 and conserved interactions between the SD2 D-loop and amino acids of SD1 and SD3 suggests selective pressure to maintain this critical structural element.The most prominent structural change between bare actin isoforms corresponds to the N-terminus location. Given the well-established central role of the N-terminus in the interactions with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins, these structural changes may dictate different biochemical interactions. For example, actin isoform-specific interfaces with myosin motors may involve a more subtle movement of the N-terminus rather than a large conformational change through a pulling mechanism.Cryo-EM studies were conducted by polymerizing G-actin with a 10× stock solution of buffer containing 0.5 M KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.1 M MOPS pH 7.0 before plunge freezing. Data collection was performed on a Titan Krios G3i operated at 300 kV, equipped with a K3 direct electron detector, a Bioquantum energy filter, and a Cs image corrector. Segments of actin filaments were picked using the template-free tracing method implemented in the filament tracer module in cryoSPARC, and 3D refinements were performed using the helical refinement module in cryoSPARC. Model building was carried out using sharpened maps and a common approach of model building, refinement, and validation for all actin isoforms. The final actin models were refined using Phenix and validated using MolProbity.
 Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences (TARDIS) is a novel approach to transgenesis that overcomes the limitations of multicellular systems and increases transgenesis throughput up to 1000-fold. TARDIS uses synthesized sequence libraries and inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences from these heritable libraries into engineered genomic sites. The method was developed in Caenorhabditis elegans but is adaptable to any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated.TARDIS splits the transgenesis process into a two-step process: creation of individuals carrying experimentally introduced sequence libraries, followed by inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components into engineered genomic sites. This results in thousands of genetically unique transgenic individuals.The power of TARDIS was demonstrated by generating a large set of individually barcoded lineages and transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries. The system increased transformation yields up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods.TARDIS is a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional single-copy transgenesis and has the potential to expand the impact of exploratory transgenesis in functional domains that are dependent on multicellular interactions, such as inter-tissue signaling, neuronal health, and animal behavior. The approach is adaptable for any situation where the sequences for integration can be introduced with high diversity and heritability, and where a genomic site for integration can be made or is available.
 In gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) undergo a complex journey from the cytosol to their final destination in the outer membrane. Multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes facilitate the translocation and assembly of OMPs. Using AF2Complex, a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline, researchers identified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and applied it to several proteins from the OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, unexpected interactions were discovered, providing insights into the mechanisms of OMP biogenesis.The OMP biogenesis pathway involves several core complexes, including the SecYEG translocon and the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM). The SecYEG translocon, a hetero-trimer composed of SecY, SecE, and SecG, is responsible for moving most cell envelope proteins across the inner membrane. Periplasmic and outer membrane proteins enter the channel in SecY via the SecA-dependent translocation pathway, and the signal peptide at the N-terminus of a substrate contains a hydrophobic segment that folds into a transmembrane α-helix once it exits the lateral gate of SecY. To release the substrate from the inner membrane, a type I signal peptidase (SPase I) cleaves the signal peptide.After the signal peptide is cleaved, a periplasmic protein has reached its destination, but an OMP continues its journey toward BAM. Five subunits constitute BAM, with BamA playing the major role in folding a β-barrel and releasing the matured product. However, many open questions remain concerning the OMP biogenesis pathway, particularly the identities and structures of the proteins involved in forming supercomplexes.To address these questions, researchers used AF2Complex to search for interacting proteins within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and identified several key interactions, including those between PpiD and YfgM, PpiD and SecY, and DsbA and PpiD. These interactions provided insights into the mechanisms of OMP biogenesis and the roles of various chaperones and proteases in the process.In summary, the use of AF2Complex in combination with deep learning models and an effective PPI ranking metric allowed researchers to uncover the molecular mechanisms of the OMP biogenesis pathway and identify key interactions between various proteins involved in the process. These results demonstrate the potential of deep learning strategies in exploring the conformational ensemble of proteins and elucidating complex biochemical pathways.
 Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), are crucial regulators of basal ganglia functions, motivation, and cognition. The connectivity of DA neurons is predominantly non-synaptic, with a majority of DA-releasing terminals not in close apposition to a postsynaptic domain. A smaller synaptic subset of DA neuron terminals has the ability to co-release glutamate or GABA. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of DA neuron axonal arbors and release sites are largely unknown.Recent studies suggest that neuroligins (NLs), trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, regulate both DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission. Neuroligins interact with neurexins (Nrxns), presynaptic cell adhesion molecules, but the role of Nrxns in DA neurons is unexplored.To test the hypothesis that Nrxns regulate DA neuron neurotransmission, mice with conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::NrxnsKO) were generated. These mice exhibited normal basic motor functions but impaired locomotor response to the psychostimulant amphetamine. DA signaling was impacted, as revealed by slower DA reuptake, decreased density of DA transporter (DAT), increased density of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), and reduced activity-dependent DA release. Electrophysiological recordings showed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of these mice.Nrxns have been suggested to contribute to the development of synapses, but they do not act as necessary drivers of axon terminal and synapse formation by DA neurons. Instead, they regulate the kinetics of DAo and GABA release by DA neurons. Further studies are necessary to decipher the role of potential candidates, including proteins from the leucocyte antigen receptor-protein tyrosine-phosphatases family, in regulating DA neuron connectivity.The findings from this study shed new light on the role of Nrxns in DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission. Nrxns are dispensable for the initial establishment of axon terminals and synapses by DA neurons but play a role in regulating both the kinetics of DAo and GABA release by DA neurons. Only a small subset of axon terminals established by DA neurons adopt a synaptic configuration, and the formation of such synaptic contacts must be regulated by other trans-synaptic proteins.
 This study examines mobile phone ownership in 33 African countries and its relationship to proximity to a health clinic, as well as inequities in ownership based on gender, urban-rural residency, age, and poverty. The study finds that 82% of individuals in these countries own mobile phones, with 42% owning basic phones and 40% owning smartphones. Individuals who live closer to a health clinic are more likely to own a mobile phone, and men and urban residents are more likely to own smartphones. Ownership decreases with age and poverty. The study also finds that some of the poorest individuals own smartphones, and ownership increases with proximity to a health clinic. These findings have implications for designing and implementing mobile health interventions in Africa, as equitable access to digital devices is necessary to avoid propagating existing healthcare access inequities.
 This study aimed to examine variables associated with variation in post-vaccination antibody levels and the subsequent likelihood of post-vaccination infection to SARS-CoV-2. The study used data from two population-based longitudinal cohorts, TwinsUK and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), during the UK vaccination roll-out. The analysis focused on anti-Spike antibody levels, identified as a correlate of protection against infection, and their relationship with post-vaccination infection.The study found that individuals with the lowest 20% of anti-Spike antibody levels at initial testing had threefold greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the following 6-9 months in TwinsUK. In addition, individuals identified as at increased risk of COVID-19 complications through the UK 'Shielded Patient List' had consistently greater odds (two- to fourfold) of having antibody levels in the lowest 10%. Third vaccination increased absolute antibody levels for almost all individuals and reduced relative disparities compared with earlier vaccinations.The study also found that older individuals, those on the UK 'Shielded Patient List', and those with lower self-rated health were more likely to have received more vaccinations and had lower self-rated health. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection varied according to the measure of infection, vaccination status, socio-demographic variables, and between the two timepoints examined.Cross-sectional antibody levels following third vaccination were much greater and more sustained, with less inter-individual variability, compared to levels for those with fewer vaccinations. Median antibody levels peaked at 9 weeks after first vaccination in both TwinsUK and ALSPAC, and after second vaccination, median levels breached the 250 BAU/mL assay limit from 2 weeks onwards.Individuals with lower antibody responses after first vaccination had increased risk of subsequent infection over the next 6-9 months. Those with anti-Spike levels in the lowest 80% within the sample had two- to threefold odds of post-vaccination infection than those in the highest quintile. Lower antibody levels were also associated with older age, serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to Q2 testing, and retirement status.The study also tested for associations with having lower antibody levels after each round of vaccination. Increased odds of lower antibody levels were consistently observed across multiple vaccination rounds for individuals with certain health-related variables, including those who received the AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine versus BNT162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech), longer time since vaccination at time of sampling, and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to antibody testing. However, the associations were not consistent for all variables, such as very frail, high multimorbidity, rheumatoid arthritis, employment status of permanently or long-term sick or disabled, and lower educational attainment.The study used python and R for data analysis and is available on GitHub. The original antibody test data are available within the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration upon application, and the original TwinsUK and ALSPAC data are available to researchers on application to ensure privacy and protect against misuse.
