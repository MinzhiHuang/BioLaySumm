 Acylation of diverse carbohydrates is catalyzed by membrane-bound proteins containing the acyltransferase-3 (AT3) domain (PF01757), which is essential for various processes in bacteria, including symbiosis, resistance to viruses and antimicrobials, and biosynthesis of antibiotics. However, the structure and mechanism of these proteins are largely unknown. In this study, evolutionary co-variance analysis was used to build a computational model of the structure of a bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB. The resulting structure exhibited a novel fold for the AT3 domain, which molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated is stable in the membrane. The AT3 domain contains 10 transmembrane helices arranged to form a large cytoplasmic cavity lined by residues essential for function. Further molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the acyl-coA donor spans the membrane through a pore created by movement of an important loop capping the inner cavity, enabling OafB to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface. Limited but important interactions with the fused SGNH domain in OafB are identified, and modeling suggests this domain is mobile and can both accept acyl-groups from the AT3 and then reach beyond the membrane to reach acceptor substrates. This new general model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could abrogate critical functions of bacterial pathogens.
 Honey bees make complex decisions when foraging, evaluating flowers for nectar and pollen based on sensory information, past experiences, context, and colony needs. To understand their decision-making capacities, researchers used signal detection theory and a controlled flight arena. They found that honey bee decisions were sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence, with acceptance responses having higher accuracy and being more sensitive to changes in available evidence and reward likelihood. Fast acceptances were more likely to be correct than slower acceptances. The study also developed a novel model of decision-making, which could be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain and proposed a system for robust autonomous decision-making with potential applications in robotics.
 Biguanides, including metformin, have been shown to lower blood sugar and promote longevity in preclinical models. Epidemiologic studies in humans support these findings, indicating favorable effects of metformin on longevity and reducing the incidence and morbidity associated with aging-related diseases. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these health benefits remain elusive.Through unbiased screening in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified a role for genes necessary for ether lipid biosynthesis in the favorable effects of biguanides. We demonstrate that biguanides prompt lifespan extension by stimulating ether lipid biogenesis. Loss of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery also mitigates lifespan extension attributable to dietary restriction, target of rapamycin (TOR) inhibition, and mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition.Ether lipids are required for activation of longevity-promoting, metabolic stress defenses downstream of the conserved transcription factor skn-1/Nrf. Overexpression of a single, key ether lipid biosynthetic enzyme, fard-1/FAR1, is sufficient to promote lifespan extension. These findings highlight the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery as a novel therapeutic target to promote healthy aging.Our previous work identified a conserved signaling axis connecting mitochondria, the nuclear pore complex, and mTORC1 inhibition that is required for metformin-mediated extension of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and inhibition of growth in worms and human cancer cells. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is not necessary for metformin-induced growth inhibition in C. elegans but is required for the drug’s pro-longevity effects.Ether lipids, a major structural component of cell membranes, have broad roles in the regulation of cell differentiation, cellular signaling, and reduction of oxidative stress through their action as antioxidants. Humans deficient in ether lipid biogenesis suffer from rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), a rare genetic disorder resulting in skeletal and facial abnormalities, psychomotor retardation, and is uniformly fatal typically before patients reach their teenage years.Ether lipids are structurally distinct from canonical phospholipids, containing a fatty alcohol conjugated to the glycerol backbone at the sn-1 position via an ether linkage. Ether lipid precursors are first synthesized by enzymes associated with the membranes of peroxisomes, the main enzymes involved in ether lipid biosynthesis within the peroxisomal matrix being glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) and alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS). Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1) supplies most of the fatty alcohols used to generate the ether linkage in the precursor, 1-O-alkyl-glycerol-3-phosphate. This precursor is then trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for acyl chain remodeling to produce various ether lipid products.In C. elegans, loss-of-function mutations of any of the three main enzymes involved in human ether lipid biosynthesis, acl-7/GNPAT, ads-1/AGPS, and fard-1/FAR1, result in an inability to produce ether-linked lipids, as in humans, and has been reported to shorten worm lifespan. Worms and human cells deficient in ether lipids exhibit compensatory changes in phospholipid species, including increases in phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylcholines containing saturated fatty acids. However, in contrast to humans, ether lipid deficient nematodes develop to adulthood at a normal rate, providing an opportunity to determine the biological roles of ether lipids in aging and longevity without pleiotropies associated with developmental rate.Here, we show that the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery is necessary for lifespan extension stimulated by metformin or the related biguanide phenformin in C. elegans. Metabolomic analysis indicates
 This study aimed to understand the universality of bacterial correlations in the gut microbiome across hosts by analyzing extensive time series data from baboon hosts. The researchers found that most bacterial correlations were weak, negative, and universal across hosts, with shared correlation patterns dominating over host-specific correlations by almost twofold. Taxon pairs that had inconsistent correlation signs in different hosts always had weak correlations within hosts. Host pairs with the most similar bacterial correlation patterns also had similar microbiome taxonomic compositions and tended to be genetic relatives. The universality of bacterial associations in baboons was similar to that in human infants and stronger than one human data set from adults. Bacterial families that showed universal correlations in human infants were often universal in baboons. These findings contribute new tools for analyzing the universality of bacterial associations across hosts, with implications for microbiome personalization, community assembly, and stability, and for designing microbiome interventions to improve host health.
 This study investigates the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex of awake mice, focusing on their dependence on breathing and local spiking activity. The researchers find that respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, which correlate with local feedback inhibition and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. These oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Functionally, respiration-driven gamma oscillations segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation, leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of gamma oscillations, bridging computation, cognition, and physiology.
 This study aimed to identify the subunits of a stable native complex involved in underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. The researchers developed a novel method called MERCI (MS-Enabled Rapid protein Complex Identification) to isolate a complex named SUMM4, which comprises SUUR and Mod (Mdg4) -67.2. SUUR is a helicase protein that negatively regulates DNA replication fork progression, while Mod (Mdg4) is a chromatin boundary protein that stimulates SUUR ATPase activity and is required for the normal spatiotemporal distribution of SUUR in vivo. Together, SUUR and Mod (Mdg4) -67.2 mediate the activities of gypsy insulators that prevent certain enhancer-promoter interactions and establish euchromatin-heterochromatin barriers in the genome. Furthermore, SuUR or mod (mdg4) mutations reverse underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin. The findings suggest that SUMM4 can impart late replication of intercalary heterochromatin by attenuating the progression of replication forks through euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries. The study also reveals a mechanism for the establishment of late replication that does not depend on an asynchronous firing of late replication origins.
 In a large-scale study involving European children aged between 5 and 12 years from six study centers across Europe, researchers aimed to clarify the relationship between accelerated biological age, as assessed through telomere length, DNA methylation age, transcriptome age, and immunometabolic age, and developmental outcomes and health risk factors. The study population included up to 1173 children, with each center contributing between 11 and 24% to the sample.The researchers found that all biological age markers were positively associated with greater BMI and adiposity. DNA methylation age and immunometabolic age were also associated with taller height. Immunometabolic age was associated with greater cognitive maturity, including improved working memory and attentiveness, while DNA methylation age was related to relative immaturity in attentiveness and externalizing behavior.BMI has consistently been linked to accelerated aging in adults across various biological age markers, and the study suggests that this link is also apparent in children. Excess adiposity increases generalized inflammation and oxidative stress, which may have direct effects on age markers, particularly telomere length and DNA methylation age acceleration.The study also found that girls had longer telomere lengths than boys, although the evidence in children is inconsistent. No other biological age markers were associated with sex, except for DNA methylation age, which was associated with accelerated aging in men in adults.The researchers observed differences in associations between biological age and development between boys and girls, with some consistency across markers. For example, both shorter telomere length and transcriptome Δ age were more strongly associated with adiposity in boys, while DNA methylation and transcriptome Δ age showed stronger associations among boys with poorer behavior. In girls, both transcriptome and immunometabolic Δ age showed stronger associations with improved attentiveness.Immunometabic Δ age was also associated with greater odds of puberty onset, driven by effects observed among girls only. However, the sample size in the subset of children was small compared to the other developmental measures, and there was no significant association with the onset of puberty for boys.The study had some limitations, including the cross-sectional design, differences in age by study center, and the limited coverage of the metabolome and proteome. However, the large population sample, integration of rich molecular data, and broad range of developmental outcomes contribute to the interpretation and understanding of biological age measures in children, crucial for clinical and epidemiological research into early life risk factors for adverse aging trajectories. Future long-term studies should investigate associations between age acceleration in children and adults to further test the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis.
 This study aimed to identify genetic associates of childhood wheezing phenotypes using a novel multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of data collected from birth to 18 years in five UK birth cohorts. Forty-four independent SNPs were identified for early-onset persistent wheeze, 25 for pre-school remitting, 33 for mid-childhood remitting, and 32 for late-onset wheeze. A novel locus on chr9q21.13 near Annexin A1 (ANXA1) was identified, exclusively associated with early-onset persistent wheeze. The most likely causative SNP, rs75260654, was identified using Promoter Capture Hi-C loops, and the risk allele (T) confers a reduction in ANXA1 expression. In mouse experiments, ANXA1 protein expression increased and mRNA was significantly induced in lung tissue following house dust mite (HDM) exposure. Anxa1-deficient mice demonstrated heightened airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and Th2 inflammation upon allergen challenge. Targeting this pathway in persistent disease may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect. The study was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.Despite the successes of genetic studies of asthma, only a small proportion of the heritability is accounted for, and heterogeneity in asthma diagnosis may dilute important genetic signals. Most GWASs used a broad definition of 'doctor-diagnosed asthma,' which is imprecise and phenotypically and mechanistically heterogeneous. This study used data-driven methods to derive subtypes of wheezing from infancy to adolescence and investigated the genetic associations of these phenotypes. The study identified a novel locus, ANXA1, exclusively associated with early-onset persistent wheeze, which may be involved in epithelial airway repair and has anti-inflammatory properties. The findings suggest that the genetic architecture of different wheeze phenotypes comprises a limited number of variants likely underpinning mechanisms shared across phenotypes but that each phenotype is also characterized by unique phenotype-specific genetic associations.Limitations of the study include the comparatively small sample size, which may be less of an issue when primary outcomes are determined by deep phenotyping. The importance of precise phenotyping was highlighted in previous studies, which identified new risk loci using smaller sample sizes but more precise asthma subtypes. The study population was of European descent, and the results cannot be generalized to different ethnicities or environments. Large consortia have been formed to increase the power to identify asthma susceptibility loci, but they do not have the depth of longitudinal data to allow the type of analyses carried out in this study. The manual and visual inspection of LZPs for the refinement of association signals and identification of functional elements was an objective approach which might have undermined the findings. However, the study's strengths include the use of data from five birth cohorts with detailed and lifelong phenotyping, which were harmonized in a common knowledge management platform, allowing joint analyses. The study produced estimates with remarkably consistent directions of effects in three parallel GWASs. Overall, the study identified subsets of SNPs differentially associated across four wheezing phenotypes from infancy to adolescence and discovered a novel locus, ANXA1, exclusively associated with early-onset persistent wheeze, which may be a promising therapeutic target.
 This study investigates the effects of common coexistence history on plant-plant interactions, biodiversity, and yield in annual crop communities. The experiment was conducted in Switzerland using six annual crop species: wheat, oat, lentil, flax, camelina, and coriander. The results showed that after only two generations, plant-plant interactions shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when plants were growing in the same diversity setting as their parents. This history effect was particularly true for mixtures and was associated with increased overyielding under fertilized conditions. However, there was no significant increase in total yield and no yield benefits in unfertilized conditions. Common coexistence history did surprisingly not lead to character displacement but instead observed character convergence towards taller plants with lower leaf dry matter content. The findings emphasize the importance of considering transgenerational effects of diversity for crop mixtures and highlight the need for breeding programs to include diversity when breeding for crop mixtures. The experiment was conducted in an outdoor experimental garden at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and was fertilized with N, P, and K at the concentration of 120 kg/ha N, 205 kg/ha P, and 120 kg/ha K. The plots were randomized among plots and beds within each fertilizer treatment, and each monoculture and mixture community consisted of one, two, or four species planted in four rows. The experiment was repeated in 2019 and 2020 with seeds coming from single individuals, monocultures, and mixtures, respectively. All analyses were performed using R version 4.1.0.
 In this study, researchers investigated how dynamic interactions during decision-making occur between two agents in a social context using a setup called "transparent games." They compared human and macaque pairs in a transparent version of the coordination game "Bach-or-Stravinsky," where agents must coordinate to achieve a reward but face a conflict about which option to choose. Most human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize payoffs, while all macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination. Remarkably, two macaque pairs learned to coordinate dynamically after training with a human confederate. The results suggest that action visibility promotes the emergence and maintenance of coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions. The study also highlights the importance of considering different social attitudes and cognitive capacities in understanding dynamic coordination.
 This study reports the development of a method to generate human granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs through TF-mediated differentiation. The generated granulosa-like cells express granulosa marker genes and have highly similar transcriptomes to the human fetal ovary. The system can model several key ovarian phenotypes, including hormonal signaling, germ cell maturation, and follicle formation. The researchers also characterized the regulatory effects of granulosa-related TFs and determined that co-expression of NR5A1 and RUNX1 or RUNX2 is minimally sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs. The study also generated hiPSC lines with controlled TF expression from a known integration site or from non-integrating episomal vectors to provide a more reproducible way to generate high-performing lines. The system has several advantages over existing in vitro models of the human ovary, including its rapid, scalable, and efficient method of producing human granulosa-like cells, which is expected to prove useful as a model for the study of ovarian development and function, and that further optimization could allow for human in vitro oogenesis. The study used two parental hiPSC lines, ATCC-BXS0116 female hiPSCs and the F66 in-house hiPSC line, and verified their karyotypes and pluripotency. The researchers used a Lonza Nucleofector for electroporations, and selection was performed with ganciclovir and colonies were picked as described above. The excision of the selection cassette was verified by genotyping. Primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1. TF cDNAs were obtained from the TFome or the ORFeome and cloned into a barcoded Dox-inducible expression vector. The final expression constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing, which also served to determine the barcode sequences for each TF. Two unique barcodes were used per TF during library pooling. Libraries were pooled using an equimolar quantity of each plasmid and electroporated into FOXL2-tdTomato reporter hiPSCs. The conditions were chosen to give an average copy number of approximately 5/cell. The study used two libraries, library #1 containing 35 TFs and library #2 containing 18 TFs, and performed experiments at 5 fmol and 50 fmol. After selection with puromycin, hiPSCs were treated with doxycycline in mTESR Plus medium for 5 days, and reporter-positive cells were isolated by FACS and genomic DNA was extracted for barcode sequencing. The study also used COV434, KGN, and HGL5 cells for comparison and performed mycoplasma testing every 3 months. The researchers used a Cytoflow Python package for data analysis.
 This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of skin color variation in a Native American population with significant African admixture but low European admixture. The research focused on the Kalinago Territory of Dominica, where approximately 55% of the genetic ancestry was Native American, 32% African, and 12% European. Three albino individuals were identified, who were homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV of African origin with an allele frequency of 0.03 and a single allele effect size of –8 melanin units. The study also found that Native American genetic ancestry alone reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units. However, none of the published polymorphisms predicted to affect skin color in Native Americans caused detectable hypopigmentation in the Kalinago population. The genetic basis for lighter skin pigmentation specific to Native American and East Asian populations remains to be identified. The study also found that the Kalinago population had among the lowest European genetic ancestry (12%) compared to other reported Caribbean Native Americans, which helped control for the effects of major European pigmentation loci in the study.
 This study aimed to understand the different mechanisms of exercise and antioxidant intervention in diabetes and verify the activation of hepatic AMPK as a hallmark of dynamic redox balance. The study utilized a type 2 diabetic rat model induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin injection. The exercise intervention was started from day 0 to day 28, and the antioxidant intervention was also started at the same time.The results showed that exercise intervention upregulated ROS production, while antioxidant intervention activated the antioxidant system. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as Nrf2, was increased in diabetic rats, and after CE intervention, the level of Nrf2 further increased, indicating that exercise intervention could activate the antioxidant system.Both CE and IE intervention decreased the 3-NT level and did not further decrease the protein carbonylation level, while MDA, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, was significantly up-regulated in the diabetic group but decreased in the exercise group. These results suggest that CE can promote redox to reach a high level of balance.The apocynin intervention, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, decreased the protein carbonylation level and MDA level in the liver, indicating that the antioxidant intervention reduced the ROS in diabetic hepatocytes, thereby decreasing the ROS-induced compensatory upregulation of Sestrin2 and Nrf2.The study also found that the phosphorylation of AMPK showed different patterns in three kinds of exercise. Both CE and IE intervention could promote the phosphorylation of AMPK compared to the diabetic rats, while EE intervention did not increase the content of AMPK phosphorylation, which might be caused by the reduction of AMPK level.In conclusion, the study found that moderate exercise promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and ameliorated autophagy in the liver, while excessive exercise aggravated mitochondrial fission and did not alleviate autophagy. The in vivo mitochondrial ROS burst caused by excessive exercise inhibited the expression of AMPK and promoted mitophagy, leading to abnormal aerobic oxidation and aggravating diabetes. The study also found that moderate ROS could directly promote AMPK activation by phosphorylation without AMP upregulation and reduce blood and liver glucose levels. However, excessive exercise-generated oxidative stress reduced AMPK expression and exacerbated diabetes. The study provides clues for the personalized management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.
 The escape trajectory (ET) of prey plays a crucial role in avoiding predation, and previous geometric models have predicted a single ET. However, many species exhibit highly variable ETs with multiple preferred directions. A new geometric model was constructed to explain the observed multiple preferred ETs in Pagrus major by incorporating the time required for prey to turn and the predator's position at the end of its attack. The optimal ET was determined by maximizing the time difference of arrival at the edge of the safety zone between the prey and predator. The model could explain various patterns of ETs observed in other species, such as a single preferred ET and multiple preferred ETs at small and large angles from the predator. The results open new avenues for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.The C-start escape response of Pagrus major consists of an initial bend, followed by a return tail flip, and continuous swimming or coasting. The initial orientation, directionality, turn angle, and ET were defined based on the prey's center of mass and the predator's attack path. The experimental data showed no asymmetry in directionality and ET distribution, and the ETs from the left and right sides were pooled. The model was input with various parameters, including the predator's width, the distance between the prey and the predator at the onset of the prey's escape response, the predator's speed, and the time required for the prey to turn. The model was then used to investigate how the choice of different ETs affects the time difference (Tdiff) for each initial orientation. The overall frequency distribution of ETs was estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, and the theoretical ET distribution was compared with the observed ET distribution using the two-sample Kuiper test. The model showed that the prey strategically adjusts the use of optimal and protean tactics based on their initial orientation, allowing for unpredictable ETs while keeping Tdiff large enough to enter the safety zone before the predator reaches it. The findings have implications for understanding the basis of the variability in ETs observed in previous studies and open new avenues for investigating how animals determine their ETs from multiple options with specific probabilities, which are modulated by the initial orientation with respect to the threat.
 The recent development of prime editing (PE) genome engineering technologies offers a simplified approach to generating human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based disease models. PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site.A systematic comparison of PE and conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs revealed that PE is more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. PE is particularly effective in generating heterozygous editing events, which is crucial for creating autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. The expression of PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limits PE in hPSCs.To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, researchers optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. This mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs.In summary, PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs due to its overall efficiency, precision, and ability to generate heterozygous mutations. By optimizing the delivery modality of the PE components, researchers have established a highly efficient genome editing platform for hPSCs.
 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells (PCs). The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is used to stratify MM patients into stages I, II, and III based on clinical and laboratory parameters, with distinct outcomes and treatment responses. However, little is known about the gene expression signatures of MM cells at the single-cell level in relation to the R-ISS stage.In this study, single-cell transcriptome sequencing was used to investigate the gene expression profiles of normal and R-ISS stage I, II, and III groups. The results showed that a novel cytotoxic PC population, which was enriched in stage II patients and expressed the marker NKG7, was identified. Additionally, a malignant PC population with significantly elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA, as well as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, was associated with unfavorable prognosis in MM. Furthermore, ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) was found to promote proliferation of MM cell lines and may serve as a detrimental marker in MM.The proportions of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells decreased along with R-ISS stages, reflecting the plasticity of the tumor immune microenvironment. Importantly, the crosstalks between myeloid cells and PCs identified several potential immunotargets, such as SIRPA-CD47 and CD74-MIF, respectively.Collectively, this study provided an R-ISS-related single-cell MM atlas and revealed the clinical significance of novel PC clusters and potential immunotargets in MM progression.
 Cas7-11 is a single subunit Type III-E CRISPR-Cas effector that functions in programmable RNA cleavage and editing. A cryo-EM structure of Desulfonema ishimotonii Cas7-11 (DiCas7-11) reveals its molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form, with evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains giving rise to its unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and both the second and third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The processed 15-nt 5’-tag interacts extensively with C7L.1 and to a lesser extent with C7L.2, nearly burying the entire 5’-tag and precluding it from complete base pairing with a complementary RNA. DiCas7-11 lacks the domains equivalent to Csm4 and Cas10 subunits and thus lacks their functions, such as recognition and stabilization of the 8-nt 5’-tag and cyclic oligoadenylate synthesis and ancillary DNA cleavage. The structure and mutational data suggest the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool. Cas7-11 is a unique Type III CRISPR-Cas system that forms a complex with the caspase-like TPR-CHAT peptidase, suggesting a potential for a viral RNA-induced and protease-mediated antiviral immunity. Cas7-11 provides a desirable platform to further develop RNA interference and editing tools due to its known collateral nuclease activities and the complex enzyme composition of Csm/Cmr. The structure of DiCas7-11 was determined using cryo-electron microscopy at an overall resolution of 2.82 Å and provides the architecture of the enzyme and the molecular basis for its enzymatic activities.
 This study investigates the impact of tree species diversity and genetic diversity on tree community productivity and trophic interactions in a subtropical forest using data from the BEF-China experiment. The researchers found that tree community productivity was higher in the four-species mixture than in monocultures, while genetic richness had no significant effect on productivity. Tree functional diversity was higher in the species mixture than in monocultures and was positively related to productivity. However, when functional diversity was calculated based on individual tree values, only species diversity but not genetic diversity had effects on tree functional diversity. Herbivore leaf damage and soil fungal diversity were lower in species mixtures than monocultures, and both had negative effects on productivity. The researchers suggest that tree diversity promoted productivity indirectly through functional diversity and trophic interactions, with positive indirect effects through reduced herbivory and soil fungal diversity. The study also found that tree genetic diversity had contrasting effects on productivity through functional diversity and soil fungal diversity in species monocultures and mixtures. Overall, the results highlight the importance of considering both tree species and genetic diversity in afforestation projects to promote ecosystem productivity and resilience.
 Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but detecting molecular interactions while tracking single molecules remains a challenge. In this study, researchers describe a new property of rhodamine dyes called proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), which allows one fluorophore (the 'sender') to reactivate a second fluorophore (the 'receiver') from a dark state when they are in proximity. PAPA operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and can be used to detect protein-protein interactions and highlight a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. The researchers demonstrate the utility of PAPA by detecting the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. This new method provides a valuable addition to the toolbox for studying molecular interactions in live cells.
 This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of calcium supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in young people under 35 years old. The study identified 43 eligible randomized controlled trials involving 7382 participants, with 3283 receiving calcium supplementation and 4099 serving as controls. The results showed that calcium supplementation significantly improved total body BMD (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.330, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.163–0.496, p < 0.001) and slightly improved total body BMC (SMD 0.149, 95% CI 0.006–0.291, p < 0.001). At the femoral neck, calcium supplementation had a stronger protective effect on BMD (SMD 0.627, 95% CI 0.338–0.915, p < 0.001) and a small improvement effect on BMC (SMD 0.364, 95% CI 0.134–0.595, p = 0.002). A slight but significant improvement in BMC was observed for the lumbar spine (SMD 0.163, 95% CI 0.008–0.317, p = 0.039), but calcium supplementation did not improve the BMD levels at the lumbar spine (SMD 0.090, 95% CI −0.044 to 0.224, p = 0.190) or total hip (SMD 0.257, 95% CI −0.053 to 0.566, p = 0.104) or the BMC level at the total hip (SMD 0.116, 95% CI −0.382 to 0.614, p = 0.648). Subgroup analyses by age, sex, region, sources of calcium supplementation, and bias risk of each individual trial showed generally consistent results with the primary analyses. The beneficial effect of calcium supplementation on bone mass implies that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving peak bone mass may be a shift in the window of intervention for osteoporosis. The study was supported by a grant from Wenzhou Medical University.
 In biological systems, liquid and solid-like biomolecular condensates can exhibit different behaviors despite containing the same molecules. The function of these condensates is affected by phase transitions and material properties, which can be tuned by various factors including temperature, concentration, and valency. However, it is unclear which factors are most efficient at regulating their behavior.To address this question, this study focused on influenza A virus (IAV) liquid cytosolic condensates, also known as viral inclusions. These condensates are sites dedicated to IAV genome assembly and exhibit liquid properties such as fusion, division, dissolution, and dynamic behavior. The researchers aimed to provide a proof of concept that liquid condensate hardening via changes in the valency of its components is more efficient than altering their concentration or temperature.They used influenza A virus liquid inclusions, which can be hardened by targeting vRNP interactions via the known NP oligomerising molecule, nucleozin, both in vitro and in vivo without affecting host proteome abundance or solubility. This study could offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies by understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions.The researchers analyzed the intracellular biophysical traits of the perturbations on viral condensates by measuring thermodynamic parameters such as thermodynamic potential, entropy, and enthalpy. They also assessed the effect of perturbations on the dynamics and kinetics of viral condensates, which revealed changes in elasticity and viscosity.The data indicated that the temperature increasing from 4°C to 42°C shifts the system to smaller inclusions that have less vRNPs, while decreasing the temperature to 4°C increases the size of inclusions and decreases their nucleation capacity and abundance. The concentration of material is a key determinant for the physical properties of condensates, and altering the concentration of vRNPs and/or Rab11a affects the size but modestly impacts IAV inclusions' material properties.The study demonstrated that the stabilization of intersegment interactions is more efficient at hardening IAV inclusions than varying the temperature or concentration of the drivers of IAV inclusions. The hardening topological phenotype was observed in the lungs of infected mice, and it was possible to affect viral inclusions without imposing additional changes in host protein abundance and solubility using solubility proteome profiling (SPP) of infected cells.In summary, this study provided insights into how IAV liquid inclusions respond to specific stimuli and offered a proof of concept that altering the material properties of biomolecular condensates could be a novel antiviral therapy. The findings could have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of biomolecular condensates in various biological contexts.
 Kinesin superfamily protein KLP-12 from Caenorhabditis elegans is an orthologue of KIF21A and KIF21B, which regulate axonal length by inhibiting microtubule dynamics. The study reports that KLP-12 regulates axonal length through inhibiting microtubule dynamics at its plus-end, as shown by genetic analyses and in vitro TIRF assays. The crystal structure of KLP-12 complexed with curved α- and β-tubulin dimers suggests that kinesin-4 precisely controls the curvature of tubulin dimers at the plus-end, which is larger than that decorated by plus-end stabilizing kinesin-1 and smaller than that decorated by destabilizing kinesin-13. This precise control is achieved by the specific interactions on the microtubule interfaces conserved among kinesin-4 motors. The results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4 motor KLP-12.
 Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) are highly potent stem cells that perpetuate without change over evolutionary time and generate cystoblast daughters, which develop into nurse cells and oocytes. The differentiation of GSCs involves several mechanisms, including the generation of a transient syncytial state, the germline cyst, and the increase of pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification to suppress transposable element (TE) activity. Relatively open GSC chromatin is further restricted by Polycomb repression of testis or somatic cell-expressed genes briefly active in early female germ cells. Subsequently, Neijre/CBP and Myc help upregulate growth and reprogram GSC metabolism by altering mitochondrial transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis, and other processes.GSCs and many other highly potent stem cells modulate the mechanisms they use to control TEs as the initial steps in their differentiation program. The totipotent stem cell state was likely shaped by the need to resist TE activity over evolutionary timescales. GSCs and early female germ cells normally express many male germ cell genes, which calls into question elevated male gene expression as a criterion for identifying germline sex determination genes. Mutants that increase testis-related gene expression and also arrest female germ cell development or generate GSC-like tumors may not determine germline sex, as elevated male gene expression is normal in female germ cells at early stages.Highly potent stem cells and GSCs are collectively immortal and responsible for protecting a species’ genome from TEs over developmental time. Animal genomes contain diverse TEs, and stem cells and germ cells would seem to require the highest levels of TE defense consistent with their high expression of CGGs. However, female Drosophila GSCs display relatively open chromatin, and like the Drosophila zygote, only form a syncytial environment and upregulate heterochromatin in downstream cells. The timing of these events suggests that stem cells use additional mechanisms in addition to the cytoplasmic piwi pathway for transposon control, which renders H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation unnecessary but fades quickly in daughter cells, necessitating them to increase alternative transposon defense mechanisms.Cluster analysis suggests that TEs transpose much less frequently at or before the stem cell stage but show that transposition has begun before the end of cyst formation. TE transcription is high in early Drosophila embryos and elevated TE expression and activity are widely observed in early mouse and human embryos. Programmed changes in TE expression patterns can accurately indicate the developmental state of stem cell lines that capture stages downstream from full pluripotency. TE-dependent transcription in early embryonic cells may even be functionally important. An association of intrinsic TE resistance with high potency states might also explain why DNA methylation levels can be reduced during the reprogramming of PGCs back to a pluripotent state to generate gonocytes.Highly potent stem cells may alter cell cycle and replication properties to enhance their ability to suppress TE movement. For example, P elements insert preferentially near replication origins and this may allow them to transpose after duplication to a new unfired origin, often in a late replicating region. Altering replication timing to eliminate late S phase might disrupt this pathway by eliminating available targets before they can be used.In summary, Drosophila female GSCs provide an attractive system for studying totipotency maintenance and differentiation. New female germ cells continuously arise downstream from GSCs and develop into ovarian follicles ordered by age within ovarioles. GSCs and developing follicles sense environmental nutrients using insulin/IGS and steroid signaling to maximize oocyte output. An important regulator of resource adaptation is Myc, whose translation becomes derepressed as early as the four-cell cyst and increases further under favorable conditions. GSCs and early female germ cells normally express many male germ cell genes, and mutants that increase testis-related gene expression and also arrest female germ cell development or generate GSC-like tumors may not determine germline sex. Highly potent stem cells and GSCs are collectively immortal and responsible for protecting a species’ genome from TEs over developmental time, and they use additional mechanisms in addition to the cytoplasmic piwi pathway for transposon control that render H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation unnecessary but fade quickly in daughter cells,
 The circadian clock plays a crucial role in the spatial and temporal control of sunflower development, synchronizing the anthesis of hundreds of florets each day to promote pollinator visits and reproductive success. Sunflowers exhibit daily rhythms in floret anthesis that persist in constant environmental conditions and are temperature-compensated, suggesting regulation by the circadian clock. The circadian clock also gates environmental responses, such as light, to influence the timing of anthesis. In constant darkness, daily rhythms in anthesis and pseudowhorl formation persist, indicating the involvement of the circadian clock. However, the strong inhibition of style elongation in constant darkness may help explain why rhythms in style emergence were less robust than those of ovary and anther growth. The different sensitivities of floral organs to light and temperature suggest they may be regulated by distinct growth regulatory pathways. The ecological and evolutionary success of the Asteraceae family is attributed in part to their compressed inflorescences that act together as single false flowers to attract pollinators. In sunflowers, the ring-like pattern of pseudowhorls that emerges during anthesis is generated by the action of the circadian clock on florets across the capitulum disk, with loss of synchronized daily rhythms in anthesis in constant light and temperature leading to loss of pseudowhorl formation. The molecular mechanisms underlying circadian control of floral organ growth are not currently known, but it is speculated that they could involve circadian control of transcription coupled with light regulation of protein activity.
 C. elegans nematodes encounter two major threats in their natural habitat: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and temperature. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by bacteria and can kill C. elegans by damaging their nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Temperature also affects C. elegans survival, with a small increase in temperature shortening their lifespan. In this study, the authors investigated how temperature and hydrogen peroxide interact to determine C. elegans survival.They found that hydrogen peroxide kills C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner at environmental concentrations above 0.1 mM, and the reaction rates of chemical reactions of H2O2 with biomolecules increase exponentially with temperature. Using chemical kinetics, they modeled how an increase in temperature from 20 to 25°C would affect the rates of the chemical reactions of H2O2 with DNA-bound Fe(II) and thiol groups in proteins. They also measured the peroxide resistance of nematodes cultured within their preferred temperature range and found that C. elegans peroxide resistance was temperature-dependent.The authors then investigated whether the temperature C. elegans experienced before encountering peroxides in the environment affected their subsequent sensitivity to peroxide. They performed temperature-shift experiments and found that nematodes grown at 25°C were more peroxide resistant than those grown at 20°C, even when shifted to a lower temperature before the peroxide survival assay.The findings contradicted a model where temperature affected how quickly the nematodes were killed by peroxides only by influencing the reactivity of peroxides. Instead, the authors propose that C. elegans nematodes induce their peroxide defenses when grown at the higher temperature to prepare for the increased lethal threat posed by peroxides at high temperature. This strategy, which they call enhancer sensing, provides faithful information about the threat that hydrogen peroxide poses by assessing the temperature-dependent enhancement of its reactivity.
 Class switch recombination (CSR) is a critical process in the adaptive immune system that generates distinct antibody isotypes. Defects in CSR are associated with autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis. During CSR, transcription is required to recruit the cytidine deaminase AID, which forms DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) essential for the formation of new antibody genes. RNA loops (R loops) within the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus have been observed at switch regions, but their role in CSR remains unclear.In this study, the authors report that cells lacking two enzymes involved in R loop removal, senataxin (SETX) and RNase H2, exhibit increased R loop formation and genome instability at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus without impacting transcriptional activity, AID recruitment, or CSR efficiency. SETX and RNase H2-deficient cells also exhibit increased insertion mutations at switch junctions, a hallmark of alternative end joining. The authors propose that SETX acts redundantly with RNase H2 to mediate timely R loop removal, promoting efficient repair while suppressing AID-dependent genome instability and insertional mutagenesis.R loop metabolism plays a role in CSR, and SETX and RNase H2 impact R loop levels at discrete loci. In human cells, the majority of R loop formation positively correlates with gene expression, suggesting that increased transcription can enhance R loop formation. However, elevated transcription cannot explain the increased R loop levels at switch regions, as germline transcript levels at switch regions are similar in all genotypes. Instead, increased or persistent R loop formation may reduce splicing efficiency of germline transcripts specifically at Sμ.In conclusion, the authors used mouse knockout models of SETX and RNase H2 to assess the impact of defective R loop removal on DNA DSB repair during CSR in primary B lymphocytes. Their findings suggest that timely R loop removal at switch regions by a SETX/RNase H2 mechanism during CSR suppresses error-prone end-joining and translocation formation at IgH.
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with the emergence of new variants, including Omicron, which has significantly reduced neutralization sensitivity to current vaccines. To address this, researchers have developed a mosaic-type trimeric RBD (mos-tri-RBD) vaccine candidate that carries key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants. In rats, mos-tri-RBD elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against Omicron and other variants, with higher neutralizing antibody titers than homo-tri-RBD or the BBIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The results suggest that mos-tri-RBD is highly immunogenic and may serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron. The mosaic strategy, which combines key mutations relevant to immune evasion into a single molecule, provides an effective strategy to achieve broad-spectrum neutralization in a single-component vaccine.
 Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, continues to pose a global health threat due to the development of resistance to antimalarial drugs. One potential solution is the discovery of drugs with novel modes of action. P. falciparum parasites infect human red blood cells, where they digest the host's main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase PfA-M17 is involved in the last step of this digestive pathway, providing parasites with free amino acids for growth, many of which are likely to originate from hemoglobin. Loss of PfA-M17 results in parasites exhibiting multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage, indicating its importance in parasite survival. PfA-M17 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that forms a homo-hexamer in its active form, with optimal function at neutral pH. It is believed that hemoglobin-derived peptides are exported from the digestive vacuole into the parasite cytoplasm, either through the chloroquine-resistance transporter or by other unidentified mechanisms. Once in the cytoplasm, it is hypothesized that hemoglobin-derived peptides are digested by PfA-M17, although it is also possible that PfA-M17 plays an additional role in the catabolic turnover of peptides from other origins. PfA-M17 and PfA-M1 are both able to cleave single amino acids from the N-terminus of small peptide chains, with PfA-M1 showing a broad substrate specificity and PfA-M17 showing almost exclusive selectivity for leucine and tryptophan in vitro. Leucine is an important substrate of the isoleucine transporter at the parasite membrane and may be important for the uptake of isoleucine across the parasite membrane. Repeated attempts to knockout Pfa-m17 have failed, suggesting it is essential for intra-erythrocytic growth. Its ortholog could be disrupted in both Plasmodium berghei and Toxoplasma gondii, leading to a significant effect on parasite replication. To functionally characterize PfA-M17 and determine its contribution to P. falciparum survival, a conditional knockdown parasite line was created using a riboswitch system. This revealed that parasites depleted of PfA-M17 experience a growth delay and fail to expand in culture, subsequently leading to parasite death. A novel and specific small molecule inhibitor to PfA-M17, compound 3, was also designed and synthesized. Parasites treated with this inhibitor demonstrate a similar growth phenotype to PfA-M17 knockdown parasites. Loss of PfA-M17, either by knockdown or treatment with 3, resulted in multiple hemozoin fragments that were representative of multiple digestive vacuoles within trophozoite stage parasites. Metabolomic analysis of knockdown and 3-treated parasites revealed that peptides accumulating after the depletion of PfA-M17 are likely to originate from hemoglobin, indicating that PfA-M17 plays a role in the final stages of its digestion.
 Early hematopoiesis is a continuous process involving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that gradually differentiate toward specific lineages. Aging and myeloid malignant transformation are characterized by changes in the composition and regulation of HSPCs. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to characterize an enriched population of human HSPCs obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals. Based on their transcriptional profile, changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging and differences in their functionality were identified. Trajectory inference revealed altered gene expression dynamics during cell differentiation, which could explain aging-associated changes in hematopoiesis.Next, key regulators of transcription were analyzed by constructing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and detecting regulons specifically active in elderly individuals. Comparison of transcriptional programs and GRNs in normal HSPCs and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) HSPCs allowed the identification of regulons specifically active in MDS cases, suggesting a role of these transcription factors in the pathogenesis of the disease.The findings demonstrate that the combination of single-cell technologies with computational analysis tools enables the study of complex biological systems such as early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with perturbations such as aging and malignant transformation. Additionally, the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients.
 The ability to learn and distinguish between relevant and irrelevant stimuli is crucial for animal survival. One mechanism that helps animals ignore irrelevant stimuli is latent inhibition, which occurs when an animal is exposed to a stimulus without reinforcement, resulting in delayed learning when that stimulus is later associated with a reward. Honey bees exhibit latent inhibition towards an odor when it is presented without food reinforcement, and individual differences in latent inhibition exist within a colony, with a genetic basis.To investigate the underlying mechanisms of individual differences in latent inhibition, researchers selected two honey bee lines for high and low latent inhibition, respectively. They mapped a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) for latent inhibition to a region of the genome containing the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Disruption of Amtyr1 signaling through pharmacological blockade or RNAi qualitatively changed the expression of latent inhibition, suggesting that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the Central Nervous System (CNS).The results identified a distinct Amtyr1-based modulatory pathway for nonassociative learning, and a model was proposed for how Amtyr1 acts as a gain control to modulate hebbian plasticity at defined synapses in the CNS. These findings also have implications for understanding intracolonial learning differences among individuals that benefit colony survival.In summary, latent inhibition is a crucial mechanism for animals to learn to ignore irrelevant stimuli and attend to those that enhance survival. Honey bees exhibit individual differences in latent inhibition, which have a genetic basis and are modulated by the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Disruption of Amtyr1 signaling affects the expression of latent inhibition, suggesting that AmTYR1 plays a role in modulating inhibitory processing in the CNS. The findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in latent inhibition and its implications for colony survival.
