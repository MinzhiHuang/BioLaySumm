 Acylation of diverse carbohydrates is catalyzed by membrane-bound proteins containing the acyltransferase-3 (AT3) domain (PF01757), which is essential for various processes in bacteria, including symbiosis, resistance to viruses and antimicrobials, and biosynthesis of antibiotics. However, the structure and mechanism of these proteins are largely unknown. In this study, evolutionary co-variance analysis was used to build a computational model of the structure of a bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB. The resulting structure exhibited a novel fold for the AT3 domain, which molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated is stable in the membrane. The AT3 domain contains 10 transmembrane helices arranged to form a large cytoplasmic cavity lined by residues essential for function. Further molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the acyl-coA donor spans the membrane through a pore created by movement of an important loop capping the inner cavity, enabling OafB to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface. Limited but important interactions with the fused SGNH domain in OafB are identified, and modeling suggests this domain is mobile and can both accept acyl-groups from the AT3 and then reach beyond the membrane to reach acceptor substrates. This new general model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could abrogate critical functions of bacterial pathogens.
 Honey bees make complex decisions when foraging, evaluating flowers for nectar and pollen based on sensory information, past experiences, context, and colony needs. To understand their decision-making capacities, researchers used signal detection theory and a controlled flight arena. They found that honey bee decisions were sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence, with acceptance responses having higher accuracy and being more sensitive to changes in available evidence and reward likelihood. Fast acceptances were more likely to be correct than slower acceptances. The study also developed a novel model of decision-making, which could be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain and proposed a system for robust autonomous decision-making with potential applications in robotics.
 Biguanides, including metformin, have been shown to lower blood sugar and promote longevity in preclinical models. Epidemiologic studies in humans support these findings, indicating favorable effects of metformin on longevity and reducing the incidence and morbidity associated with aging-related diseases. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these health benefits remain elusive.Through unbiased screening in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified a role for genes necessary for ether lipid biosynthesis in the favorable effects of biguanides. We demonstrate that biguanides prompt lifespan extension by stimulating ether lipid biogenesis. Loss of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery also mitigates lifespan extension attributable to dietary restriction, target of rapamycin (TOR) inhibition, and mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition.Ether lipids are required for activation of longevity-promoting, metabolic stress defenses downstream of the conserved transcription factor skn-1/Nrf. Overexpression of a single, key ether lipid biosynthetic enzyme, fard-1/FAR1, is sufficient to promote lifespan extension. These findings highlight the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery as a novel therapeutic target to promote healthy aging.Our previous work identified a conserved signaling axis connecting mitochondria, the nuclear pore complex, and mTORC1 inhibition that is required for metformin-mediated extension of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and inhibition of growth in worms and human cancer cells. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is not necessary for metformin-induced growth inhibition in C. elegans but is required for the drug’s pro-longevity effects.Ether lipids, a major structural component of cell membranes, have broad roles in the regulation of cell differentiation, cellular signaling, and reduction of oxidative stress through their action as antioxidants. Humans deficient in ether lipid biogenesis suffer from rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), a rare genetic disorder resulting in skeletal and facial abnormalities, psychomotor retardation, and is uniformly fatal typically before patients reach their teenage years.Ether lipids are structurally distinct from canonical phospholipids, containing a fatty alcohol conjugated to the glycerol backbone at the sn-1 position via an ether linkage. Ether lipid precursors are first synthesized by enzymes associated with the membranes of peroxisomes, the main enzymes involved in ether lipid biosynthesis within the peroxisomal matrix being glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) and alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS). Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1) supplies most of the fatty alcohols used to generate the ether linkage in the precursor, 1-O-alkyl-glycerol-3-phosphate. This precursor is then trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for acyl chain remodeling to produce various ether lipid products.In C. elegans, loss-of-function mutations of any of the three main enzymes involved in human ether lipid biosynthesis, acl-7/GNPAT, ads-1/AGPS, and fard-1/FAR1, result in an inability to produce ether-linked lipids, as in humans, and has been reported to shorten worm lifespan. Worms and human cells deficient in ether lipids exhibit compensatory changes in phospholipid species, including increases in phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylcholines containing saturated fatty acids. However, in contrast to humans, ether lipid deficient nematodes develop to adulthood at a normal rate, providing an opportunity to determine the biological roles of ether lipids in aging and longevity without pleiotropies associated with developmental rate.Here, we show that the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery is necessary for lifespan extension stimulated by metformin or the related biguanide phenformin in C. elegans. Metabolomic analysis indicates
 This study aimed to understand the universality of bacterial correlations in the gut microbiome across hosts by analyzing extensive time series data from baboon hosts. The researchers found that most bacterial correlations were weak, negative, and universal across hosts, with shared correlation patterns dominating over host-specific correlations by almost twofold. Taxon pairs that had inconsistent correlation signs in different hosts always had weak correlations within hosts. Host pairs with the most similar bacterial correlation patterns also had similar microbiome taxonomic compositions and tended to be genetic relatives. The universality of bacterial associations in baboons was similar to that in human infants and stronger than one human data set from adults. Bacterial families that showed universal correlations in human infants were often universal in baboons. These findings contribute new tools for analyzing the universality of bacterial associations across hosts, with implications for microbiome personalization, community assembly, and stability, and for designing microbiome interventions to improve host health.
 This study investigates the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex of awake mice, focusing on their dependence on breathing and local spiking activity. The researchers find that respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, which correlate with local feedback inhibition and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. These oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Functionally, respiration-driven gamma oscillations segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation, leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of gamma oscillations, bridging computation, cognition, and physiology.
 This study aimed to identify the subunits of a stable native complex involved in underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. The researchers developed a novel method called MERCI (MS-Enabled Rapid protein Complex Identification) to isolate a complex named SUMM4, which comprises SUUR and Mod (Mdg4) -67.2. SUUR is a helicase protein that negatively regulates DNA replication fork progression, while Mod (Mdg4) is a chromatin boundary protein that stimulates SUUR ATPase activity and is required for the normal spatiotemporal distribution of SUUR in vivo. Together, SUUR and Mod (Mdg4) -67.2 mediate the activities of gypsy insulators that prevent certain enhancer-promoter interactions and establish euchromatin-heterochromatin barriers in the genome. Furthermore, SuUR or mod (mdg4) mutations reverse underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin. The findings suggest that SUMM4 can impart late replication of intercalary heterochromatin by attenuating the progression of replication forks through euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries. The study also reveals a mechanism for the establishment of late replication that does not depend on an asynchronous firing of late replication origins.
 In a large-scale study involving European children aged between 5 and 12 years from six study centers across Europe, researchers aimed to clarify the relationship between accelerated biological age, as assessed through telomere length, DNA methylation age, transcriptome age, and immunometabolic age, and developmental outcomes and health risk factors. The study population included up to 1173 children, with each center contributing between 11 and 24% to the sample.The researchers found that all biological age markers were positively associated with greater BMI and adiposity. DNA methylation age and immunometabolic age were also associated with taller height. Immunometabolic age was associated with greater cognitive maturity, including improved working memory and attentiveness, while DNA methylation age was related to relative immaturity in attentiveness and externalizing behavior.BMI has consistently been linked to accelerated aging in adults across various biological age markers, and the study suggests that this link is also apparent in children. Excess adiposity increases generalized inflammation and oxidative stress, which may have direct effects on age markers, particularly telomere length and DNA methylation age acceleration.The study also found that girls had longer telomere lengths than boys, although the evidence in children is inconsistent. No other biological age markers were associated with sex, except for DNA methylation age, which was associated with accelerated aging in men in adults.The researchers observed differences in associations between biological age and development between boys and girls, with some consistency across markers. For example, both shorter telomere length and transcriptome Δ age were more strongly associated with adiposity in boys, while DNA methylation and transcriptome Δ age showed stronger associations among boys with poorer behavior. In girls, both transcriptome and immunometabolic Δ age showed stronger associations with improved attentiveness.Immunometabic Δ age was also associated with greater odds of puberty onset, driven by effects observed among girls only. However, the sample size in the subset of children was small compared to the other developmental measures, and there was no significant association with the onset of puberty for boys.The study had some limitations, including the cross-sectional design, differences in age by study center, and the limited coverage of the metabolome and proteome. However, the large population sample, integration of rich molecular data, and broad range of developmental outcomes contribute to the interpretation and understanding of biological age measures in children, crucial for clinical and epidemiological research into early life risk factors for adverse aging trajectories. Future long-term studies should investigate associations between age acceleration in children and adults to further test the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis.
 This study aimed to identify genetic associates of childhood wheezing phenotypes using a novel multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of data collected from birth to 18 years in five UK birth cohorts. Forty-four independent SNPs were identified for early-onset persistent wheeze, 25 for pre-school remitting, 33 for mid-childhood remitting, and 32 for late-onset wheeze. A novel locus on chr9q21.13 near Annexin A1 (ANXA1) was identified, exclusively associated with early-onset persistent wheeze. The most likely causative SNP, rs75260654, was identified using Promoter Capture Hi-C loops, and the risk allele (T) confers a reduction in ANXA1 expression. In mouse experiments, ANXA1 protein expression increased and mRNA was significantly induced in lung tissue following house dust mite (HDM) exposure. Anxa1-deficient mice demonstrated heightened airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and Th2 inflammation upon allergen challenge. Targeting this pathway in persistent disease may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect. The study was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.Despite the successes of genetic studies of asthma, only a small proportion of the heritability is accounted for, and heterogeneity in asthma diagnosis may dilute important genetic signals. Most GWASs used a broad definition of 'doctor-diagnosed asthma,' which is imprecise and phenotypically and mechanistically heterogeneous. This study used data-driven methods to derive subtypes of wheezing from infancy to adolescence and investigated the genetic associations of these phenotypes. The study identified a novel locus, ANXA1, exclusively associated with early-onset persistent wheeze, which may be involved in epithelial airway repair and has anti-inflammatory properties. The findings suggest that the genetic architecture of different wheeze phenotypes comprises a limited number of variants likely underpinning mechanisms shared across phenotypes but that each phenotype is also characterized by unique phenotype-specific genetic associations.Limitations of the study include the comparatively small sample size, which may be less of an issue when primary outcomes are determined by deep phenotyping. The importance of precise phenotyping was highlighted in previous studies, which identified new risk loci using smaller sample sizes but more precise asthma subtypes. The study population was of European descent, and the results cannot be generalized to different ethnicities or environments. Large consortia have been formed to increase the power to identify asthma susceptibility loci, but they do not have the depth of longitudinal data to allow the type of analyses carried out in this study. The manual and visual inspection of LZPs for the refinement of association signals and identification of functional elements was an objective approach which might have undermined the findings. However, the study's strengths include the use of data from five birth cohorts with detailed and lifelong phenotyping, which were harmonized in a common knowledge management platform, allowing joint analyses. The study produced estimates with remarkably consistent directions of effects in three parallel GWASs. Overall, the study identified subsets of SNPs differentially associated across four wheezing phenotypes from infancy to adolescence and discovered a novel locus, ANXA1, exclusively associated with early-onset persistent wheeze, which may be a promising therapeutic target.
 This study investigates the effects of common coexistence history on plant-plant interactions, biodiversity, and yield in annual crop communities. The experiment was conducted in Switzerland using six annual crop species: wheat, oat, lentil, flax, camelina, and coriander. The results showed that after only two generations, plant-plant interactions shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when plants were growing in the same diversity setting as their parents. This history effect was particularly true for mixtures and was associated with increased overyielding under fertilized conditions. However, there was no significant increase in total yield and no yield benefits in unfertilized conditions. Common coexistence history did surprisingly not lead to character displacement but instead observed character convergence towards taller plants with lower leaf dry matter content. The findings emphasize the importance of considering transgenerational effects of diversity for crop mixtures and highlight the need for breeding programs to include diversity when breeding for crop mixtures. The experiment was conducted in an outdoor experimental garden at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and was fertilized with N, P, and K at the concentration of 120 kg/ha N, 205 kg/ha P, and 120 kg/ha K. The plots were randomized among plots and beds within each fertilizer treatment, and each monoculture and mixture community consisted of one, two, or four species planted in four rows. The experiment was repeated in 2019 and 2020 with seeds coming from single individuals, monocultures, and mixtures, respectively. All analyses were performed using R version 4.1.0.
 In this study, researchers investigated how dynamic interactions during decision-making occur between two agents in a social context using a setup called "transparent games." They compared human and macaque pairs in a transparent version of the coordination game "Bach-or-Stravinsky," where agents must coordinate to achieve a reward but face a conflict about which option to choose. Most human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize payoffs, while all macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination. Remarkably, two macaque pairs learned to coordinate dynamically after training with a human confederate. The results suggest that action visibility promotes the emergence and maintenance of coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions. The study also highlights the importance of considering different social attitudes and cognitive capacities in understanding dynamic coordination.
 This study reports the development of a method to generate human granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs through TF-mediated differentiation. The generated granulosa-like cells express granulosa marker genes and have highly similar transcriptomes to the human fetal ovary. The system can model several key ovarian phenotypes, including hormonal signaling, germ cell maturation, and follicle formation. The researchers also characterized the regulatory effects of granulosa-related TFs and determined that co-expression of NR5A1 and RUNX1 or RUNX2 is minimally sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs. The study also generated hiPSC lines with controlled TF expression from a known integration site or from non-integrating episomal vectors to provide a more reproducible way to generate high-performing lines. The system has several advantages over existing in vitro models of the human ovary, including its rapid, scalable, and efficient method of producing human granulosa-like cells, which is expected to prove useful as a model for the study of ovarian development and function, and that further optimization could allow for human in vitro oogenesis. The study used two parental hiPSC lines, ATCC-BXS0116 female hiPSCs and the F66 in-house hiPSC line, and verified their karyotypes and pluripotency. The researchers used a Lonza Nucleofector for electroporations, and selection was performed with ganciclovir and colonies were picked as described above. The excision of the selection cassette was verified by genotyping. Primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1. TF cDNAs were obtained from the TFome or the ORFeome and cloned into a barcoded Dox-inducible expression vector. The final expression constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing, which also served to determine the barcode sequences for each TF. Two unique barcodes were used per TF during library pooling. Libraries were pooled using an equimolar quantity of each plasmid and electroporated into FOXL2-tdTomato reporter hiPSCs. The conditions were chosen to give an average copy number of approximately 5/cell. The study used two libraries, library #1 containing 35 TFs and library #2 containing 18 TFs, and performed experiments at 5 fmol and 50 fmol. After selection with puromycin, hiPSCs were treated with doxycycline in mTESR Plus medium for 5 days, and reporter-positive cells were isolated by FACS and genomic DNA was extracted for barcode sequencing. The study also used COV434, KGN, and HGL5 cells for comparison and performed mycoplasma testing every 3 months. The researchers used a Cytoflow Python package for data analysis.
 This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of skin color variation in a Native American population with significant African admixture but low European admixture. The research focused on the Kalinago Territory of Dominica, where approximately 55% of the genetic ancestry was Native American, 32% African, and 12% European. Three albino individuals were identified, who were homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV of African origin with an allele frequency of 0.03 and a single allele effect size of –8 melanin units. The study also found that Native American genetic ancestry alone reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units. However, none of the published polymorphisms predicted to affect skin color in Native Americans caused detectable hypopigmentation in the Kalinago population. The genetic basis for lighter skin pigmentation specific to Native American and East Asian populations remains to be identified. The study also found that the Kalinago population had among the lowest European genetic ancestry (12%) compared to other reported Caribbean Native Americans, which helped control for the effects of major European pigmentation loci in the study.
 This study aimed to understand the different mechanisms of exercise and antioxidant intervention in diabetes and verify the activation of hepatic AMPK as a hallmark of dynamic redox balance. The study utilized a type 2 diabetic rat model induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin injection. The exercise intervention was started from day 0 to day 28, and the antioxidant intervention was also started at the same time.The results showed that exercise intervention upregulated ROS production, while antioxidant intervention activated the antioxidant system. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as Nrf2, was increased in diabetic rats, and after CE intervention, the level of Nrf2 further increased, indicating that exercise intervention could activate the antioxidant system.Both CE and IE intervention decreased the 3-NT level and did not further decrease the protein carbonylation level, while MDA, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, was significantly up-regulated in the diabetic group but decreased in the exercise group. These results suggest that CE can promote redox to reach a high level of balance.The apocynin intervention, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, decreased the protein carbonylation level and MDA level in the liver, indicating that the antioxidant intervention reduced the ROS in diabetic hepatocytes, thereby decreasing the ROS-induced compensatory upregulation of Sestrin2 and Nrf2.The study also found that the phosphorylation of AMPK showed different patterns in three kinds of exercise. Both CE and IE intervention could promote the phosphorylation of AMPK compared to the diabetic rats, while EE intervention did not increase the content of AMPK phosphorylation, which might be caused by the reduction of AMPK level.In conclusion, the study found that moderate exercise promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and ameliorated autophagy in the liver, while excessive exercise aggravated mitochondrial fission and did not alleviate autophagy. The in vivo mitochondrial ROS burst caused by excessive exercise inhibited the expression of AMPK and promoted mitophagy, leading to abnormal aerobic oxidation and aggravating diabetes. The study also found that moderate ROS could directly promote AMPK activation by phosphorylation without AMP upregulation and reduce blood and liver glucose levels. However, excessive exercise-generated oxidative stress reduced AMPK expression and exacerbated diabetes. The study provides clues for the personalized management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.
 The escape trajectory (ET) of prey plays a crucial role in avoiding predation, and previous geometric models have predicted a single ET. However, many species exhibit highly variable ETs with multiple preferred directions. A new geometric model was constructed to explain the observed multiple preferred ETs in Pagrus major by incorporating the time required for prey to turn and the predator's position at the end of its attack. The optimal ET was determined by maximizing the time difference of arrival at the edge of the safety zone between the prey and predator. The model could explain various patterns of ETs observed in other species, such as a single preferred ET and multiple preferred ETs at small and large angles from the predator. The results open new avenues for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.The C-start escape response of Pagrus major consists of an initial bend, followed by a return tail flip, and continuous swimming or coasting. The initial orientation, directionality, turn angle, and ET were defined based on the prey's center of mass and the predator's attack path. The experimental data showed no asymmetry in directionality and ET distribution, and the ETs from the left and right sides were pooled. The model was input with various parameters, including the predator's width, the distance between the prey and the predator at the onset of the prey's escape response, the predator's speed, and the time required for the prey to turn. The model was then used to investigate how the choice of different ETs affects the time difference (Tdiff) for each initial orientation. The overall frequency distribution of ETs was estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, and the theoretical ET distribution was compared with the observed ET distribution using the two-sample Kuiper test. The model showed that the prey strategically adjusts the use of optimal and protean tactics based on their initial orientation, allowing for unpredictable ETs while keeping Tdiff large enough to enter the safety zone before the predator reaches it. The findings have implications for understanding the basis of the variability in ETs observed in previous studies and open new avenues for investigating how animals determine their ETs from multiple options with specific probabilities, which are modulated by the initial orientation with respect to the threat.
 The recent development of prime editing (PE) genome engineering technologies offers a simplified approach to generating human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based disease models. PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site.A systematic comparison of PE and conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs revealed that PE is more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. PE is particularly effective in generating heterozygous editing events, which is crucial for creating autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. The expression of PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limits PE in hPSCs.To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, researchers optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. This mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs.In summary, PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs due to its overall efficiency, precision, and ability to generate heterozygous mutations. By optimizing the delivery modality of the PE components, researchers have established a highly efficient genome editing platform for hPSCs.
 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells (PCs). The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is used to stratify MM patients into stages I, II, and III based on clinical and laboratory parameters, with distinct outcomes and treatment responses. However, little is known about the gene expression signatures of MM cells at the single-cell level in relation to the R-ISS stage.In this study, single-cell transcriptome sequencing was used to investigate the gene expression profiles of normal and R-ISS stage I, II, and III groups. The results showed that a novel cytotoxic PC population, which was enriched in stage II patients and expressed the marker NKG7, was identified. Additionally, a malignant PC population with significantly elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA, as well as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, was associated with unfavorable prognosis in MM. Furthermore, ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) was found to promote proliferation of MM cell lines and may serve as a detrimental marker in MM.The proportions of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells decreased along with R-ISS stages, reflecting the plasticity of the tumor immune microenvironment. Importantly, the crosstalks between myeloid cells and PCs identified several potential immunotargets, such as SIRPA-CD47 and CD74-MIF, respectively.Collectively, this study provided an R-ISS-related single-cell MM atlas and revealed the clinical significance of novel PC clusters and potential immunotargets in MM progression.
 Cas7-11 is a single subunit Type III-E CRISPR-Cas effector that functions in programmable RNA cleavage and editing. A cryo-EM structure of Desulfonema ishimotonii Cas7-11 (DiCas7-11) reveals its molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form, with evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains giving rise to its unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and both the second and third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The processed 15-nt 5’-tag interacts extensively with C7L.1 and to a lesser extent with C7L.2, nearly burying the entire 5’-tag and precluding it from complete base pairing with a complementary RNA. DiCas7-11 lacks the domains equivalent to Csm4 and Cas10 subunits and thus lacks their functions, such as recognition and stabilization of the 8-nt 5’-tag and cyclic oligoadenylate synthesis and ancillary DNA cleavage. The structure and mutational data suggest the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool. Cas7-11 is a unique Type III CRISPR-Cas system that forms a complex with the caspase-like TPR-CHAT peptidase, suggesting a potential for a viral RNA-induced and protease-mediated antiviral immunity. Cas7-11 provides a desirable platform to further develop RNA interference and editing tools due to its known collateral nuclease activities and the complex enzyme composition of Csm/Cmr. The structure of DiCas7-11 was determined using cryo-electron microscopy at an overall resolution of 2.82 Å and provides the architecture of the enzyme and the molecular basis for its enzymatic activities.
 This study investigates the impact of tree species diversity and genetic diversity on tree community productivity and trophic interactions in a subtropical forest using data from the BEF-China experiment. The researchers found that tree community productivity was higher in the four-species mixture than in monocultures, while genetic richness had no significant effect on productivity. Tree functional diversity was higher in the species mixture than in monocultures and was positively related to productivity. However, when functional diversity was calculated based on individual tree values, only species diversity but not genetic diversity had effects on tree functional diversity. Herbivore leaf damage and soil fungal diversity were lower in species mixtures than monocultures, and both had negative effects on productivity. The researchers suggest that tree diversity promoted productivity indirectly through functional diversity and trophic interactions, with positive indirect effects through reduced herbivory and soil fungal diversity. The study also found that tree genetic diversity had contrasting effects on productivity through functional diversity and soil fungal diversity in species monocultures and mixtures. Overall, the results highlight the importance of considering both tree species and genetic diversity in afforestation projects to promote ecosystem productivity and resilience.
 Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but detecting molecular interactions while tracking single molecules remains a challenge. In this study, researchers describe a new property of rhodamine dyes called proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), which allows one fluorophore (the 'sender') to reactivate a second fluorophore (the 'receiver') from a dark state when they are in proximity. PAPA operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and can be used to detect protein-protein interactions and highlight a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. The researchers demonstrate the utility of PAPA by detecting the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. This new method provides a valuable addition to the toolbox for studying molecular interactions in live cells.
 This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of calcium supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in young people under 35 years old. The study identified 43 eligible randomized controlled trials involving 7382 participants, with 3283 receiving calcium supplementation and 4099 serving as controls. The results showed that calcium supplementation significantly improved total body BMD (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.330, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.163–0.496, p < 0.001) and slightly improved total body BMC (SMD 0.149, 95% CI 0.006–0.291, p < 0.001). At the femoral neck, calcium supplementation had a stronger protective effect on BMD (SMD 0.627, 95% CI 0.338–0.915, p < 0.001) and a small improvement effect on BMC (SMD 0.364, 95% CI 0.134–0.595, p = 0.002). A slight but significant improvement in BMC was observed for the lumbar spine (SMD 0.163, 95% CI 0.008–0.317, p = 0.039), but calcium supplementation did not improve the BMD levels at the lumbar spine (SMD 0.090, 95% CI −0.044 to 0.224, p = 0.190) or total hip (SMD 0.257, 95% CI −0.053 to 0.566, p = 0.104) or the BMC level at the total hip (SMD 0.116, 95% CI −0.382 to 0.614, p = 0.648). Subgroup analyses by age, sex, region, sources of calcium supplementation, and bias risk of each individual trial showed generally consistent results with the primary analyses. The beneficial effect of calcium supplementation on bone mass implies that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving peak bone mass may be a shift in the window of intervention for osteoporosis. The study was supported by a grant from Wenzhou Medical University.
 In biological systems, liquid and solid-like biomolecular condensates can exhibit different behaviors despite containing the same molecules. The function of these condensates is affected by phase transitions and material properties, which can be tuned by various factors including temperature, concentration, and valency. However, it is unclear which factors are most efficient at regulating their behavior.To address this question, this study focused on influenza A virus (IAV) liquid cytosolic condensates, also known as viral inclusions. These condensates are sites dedicated to IAV genome assembly and exhibit liquid properties such as fusion, division, dissolution, and dynamic behavior. The researchers aimed to provide a proof of concept that liquid condensate hardening via changes in the valency of its components is more efficient than altering their concentration or temperature.They used influenza A virus liquid inclusions, which can be hardened by targeting vRNP interactions via the known NP oligomerising molecule, nucleozin, both in vitro and in vivo without affecting host proteome abundance or solubility. This study could offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies by understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions.The researchers analyzed the intracellular biophysical traits of the perturbations on viral condensates by measuring thermodynamic parameters such as thermodynamic potential, entropy, and enthalpy. They also assessed the effect of perturbations on the dynamics and kinetics of viral condensates, which revealed changes in elasticity and viscosity.The data indicated that the temperature increasing from 4°C to 42°C shifts the system to smaller inclusions that have less vRNPs, while decreasing the temperature to 4°C increases the size of inclusions and decreases their nucleation capacity and abundance. The concentration of material is a key determinant for the physical properties of condensates, and altering the concentration of vRNPs and/or Rab11a affects the size but modestly impacts IAV inclusions' material properties.The study demonstrated that the stabilization of intersegment interactions is more efficient at hardening IAV inclusions than varying the temperature or concentration of the drivers of IAV inclusions. The hardening topological phenotype was observed in the lungs of infected mice, and it was possible to affect viral inclusions without imposing additional changes in host protein abundance and solubility using solubility proteome profiling (SPP) of infected cells.In summary, this study provided insights into how IAV liquid inclusions respond to specific stimuli and offered a proof of concept that altering the material properties of biomolecular condensates could be a novel antiviral therapy. The findings could have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of biomolecular condensates in various biological contexts.
 Kinesin superfamily protein KLP-12 from Caenorhabditis elegans is an orthologue of KIF21A and KIF21B, which regulate axonal length by inhibiting microtubule dynamics. The study reports that KLP-12 regulates axonal length through inhibiting microtubule dynamics at its plus-end, as shown by genetic analyses and in vitro TIRF assays. The crystal structure of KLP-12 complexed with curved α- and β-tubulin dimers suggests that kinesin-4 precisely controls the curvature of tubulin dimers at the plus-end, which is larger than that decorated by plus-end stabilizing kinesin-1 and smaller than that decorated by destabilizing kinesin-13. This precise control is achieved by the specific interactions on the microtubule interfaces conserved among kinesin-4 motors. The results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4 motor KLP-12.
 Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) are highly potent stem cells that perpetuate without change over evolutionary time and generate cystoblast daughters, which develop into nurse cells and oocytes. The differentiation of GSCs involves several mechanisms, including the generation of a transient syncytial state, the germline cyst, and the increase of pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification to suppress transposable element (TE) activity. Relatively open GSC chromatin is further restricted by Polycomb repression of testis or somatic cell-expressed genes briefly active in early female germ cells. Subsequently, Neijre/CBP and Myc help upregulate growth and reprogram GSC metabolism by altering mitochondrial transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis, and other processes.GSCs and many other highly potent stem cells modulate the mechanisms they use to control TEs as the initial steps in their differentiation program. The totipotent stem cell state was likely shaped by the need to resist TE activity over evolutionary timescales. GSCs and early female germ cells normally express many male germ cell genes, which calls into question elevated male gene expression as a criterion for identifying germline sex determination genes. Mutants that increase testis-related gene expression and also arrest female germ cell development or generate GSC-like tumors may not determine germline sex, as elevated male gene expression is normal in female germ cells at early stages.Highly potent stem cells and GSCs are collectively immortal and responsible for protecting a species’ genome from TEs over developmental time. Animal genomes contain diverse TEs, and stem cells and germ cells would seem to require the highest levels of TE defense consistent with their high expression of CGGs. However, female Drosophila GSCs display relatively open chromatin, and like the Drosophila zygote, only form a syncytial environment and upregulate heterochromatin in downstream cells. The timing of these events suggests that stem cells use additional mechanisms in addition to the cytoplasmic piwi pathway for transposon control, which renders H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation unnecessary but fades quickly in daughter cells, necessitating them to increase alternative transposon defense mechanisms.Cluster analysis suggests that TEs transpose much less frequently at or before the stem cell stage but show that transposition has begun before the end of cyst formation. TE transcription is high in early Drosophila embryos and elevated TE expression and activity are widely observed in early mouse and human embryos. Programmed changes in TE expression patterns can accurately indicate the developmental state of stem cell lines that capture stages downstream from full pluripotency. TE-dependent transcription in early embryonic cells may even be functionally important. An association of intrinsic TE resistance with high potency states might also explain why DNA methylation levels can be reduced during the reprogramming of PGCs back to a pluripotent state to generate gonocytes.Highly potent stem cells may alter cell cycle and replication properties to enhance their ability to suppress TE movement. For example, P elements insert preferentially near replication origins and this may allow them to transpose after duplication to a new unfired origin, often in a late replicating region. Altering replication timing to eliminate late S phase might disrupt this pathway by eliminating available targets before they can be used.In summary, Drosophila female GSCs provide an attractive system for studying totipotency maintenance and differentiation. New female germ cells continuously arise downstream from GSCs and develop into ovarian follicles ordered by age within ovarioles. GSCs and developing follicles sense environmental nutrients using insulin/IGS and steroid signaling to maximize oocyte output. An important regulator of resource adaptation is Myc, whose translation becomes derepressed as early as the four-cell cyst and increases further under favorable conditions. GSCs and early female germ cells normally express many male germ cell genes, and mutants that increase testis-related gene expression and also arrest female germ cell development or generate GSC-like tumors may not determine germline sex. Highly potent stem cells and GSCs are collectively immortal and responsible for protecting a species’ genome from TEs over developmental time, and they use additional mechanisms in addition to the cytoplasmic piwi pathway for transposon control that render H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation unnecessary but fade quickly in daughter cells,
 The circadian clock plays a crucial role in the spatial and temporal control of sunflower development, synchronizing the anthesis of hundreds of florets each day to promote pollinator visits and reproductive success. Sunflowers exhibit daily rhythms in floret anthesis that persist in constant environmental conditions and are temperature-compensated, suggesting regulation by the circadian clock. The circadian clock also gates environmental responses, such as light, to influence the timing of anthesis. In constant darkness, daily rhythms in anthesis and pseudowhorl formation persist, indicating the involvement of the circadian clock. However, the strong inhibition of style elongation in constant darkness may help explain why rhythms in style emergence were less robust than those of ovary and anther growth. The different sensitivities of floral organs to light and temperature suggest they may be regulated by distinct growth regulatory pathways. The ecological and evolutionary success of the Asteraceae family is attributed in part to their compressed inflorescences that act together as single false flowers to attract pollinators. In sunflowers, the ring-like pattern of pseudowhorls that emerges during anthesis is generated by the action of the circadian clock on florets across the capitulum disk, with loss of synchronized daily rhythms in anthesis in constant light and temperature leading to loss of pseudowhorl formation. The molecular mechanisms underlying circadian control of floral organ growth are not currently known, but it is speculated that they could involve circadian control of transcription coupled with light regulation of protein activity.
 C. elegans nematodes encounter two major threats in their natural habitat: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and temperature. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by bacteria and can kill C. elegans by damaging their nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Temperature also affects C. elegans survival, with a small increase in temperature shortening their lifespan. In this study, the authors investigated how temperature and hydrogen peroxide interact to determine C. elegans survival.They found that hydrogen peroxide kills C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner at environmental concentrations above 0.1 mM, and the reaction rates of chemical reactions of H2O2 with biomolecules increase exponentially with temperature. Using chemical kinetics, they modeled how an increase in temperature from 20 to 25°C would affect the rates of the chemical reactions of H2O2 with DNA-bound Fe(II) and thiol groups in proteins. They also measured the peroxide resistance of nematodes cultured within their preferred temperature range and found that C. elegans peroxide resistance was temperature-dependent.The authors then investigated whether the temperature C. elegans experienced before encountering peroxides in the environment affected their subsequent sensitivity to peroxide. They performed temperature-shift experiments and found that nematodes grown at 25°C were more peroxide resistant than those grown at 20°C, even when shifted to a lower temperature before the peroxide survival assay.The findings contradicted a model where temperature affected how quickly the nematodes were killed by peroxides only by influencing the reactivity of peroxides. Instead, the authors propose that C. elegans nematodes induce their peroxide defenses when grown at the higher temperature to prepare for the increased lethal threat posed by peroxides at high temperature. This strategy, which they call enhancer sensing, provides faithful information about the threat that hydrogen peroxide poses by assessing the temperature-dependent enhancement of its reactivity.
 Class switch recombination (CSR) is a critical process in the adaptive immune system that generates distinct antibody isotypes. Defects in CSR are associated with autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis. During CSR, transcription is required to recruit the cytidine deaminase AID, which forms DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) essential for the formation of new antibody genes. RNA loops (R loops) within the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus have been observed at switch regions, but their role in CSR remains unclear.In this study, the authors report that cells lacking two enzymes involved in R loop removal, senataxin (SETX) and RNase H2, exhibit increased R loop formation and genome instability at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus without impacting transcriptional activity, AID recruitment, or CSR efficiency. SETX and RNase H2-deficient cells also exhibit increased insertion mutations at switch junctions, a hallmark of alternative end joining. The authors propose that SETX acts redundantly with RNase H2 to mediate timely R loop removal, promoting efficient repair while suppressing AID-dependent genome instability and insertional mutagenesis.R loop metabolism plays a role in CSR, and SETX and RNase H2 impact R loop levels at discrete loci. In human cells, the majority of R loop formation positively correlates with gene expression, suggesting that increased transcription can enhance R loop formation. However, elevated transcription cannot explain the increased R loop levels at switch regions, as germline transcript levels at switch regions are similar in all genotypes. Instead, increased or persistent R loop formation may reduce splicing efficiency of germline transcripts specifically at Sμ.In conclusion, the authors used mouse knockout models of SETX and RNase H2 to assess the impact of defective R loop removal on DNA DSB repair during CSR in primary B lymphocytes. Their findings suggest that timely R loop removal at switch regions by a SETX/RNase H2 mechanism during CSR suppresses error-prone end-joining and translocation formation at IgH.
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with the emergence of new variants, including Omicron, which has significantly reduced neutralization sensitivity to current vaccines. To address this, researchers have developed a mosaic-type trimeric RBD (mos-tri-RBD) vaccine candidate that carries key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants. In rats, mos-tri-RBD elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against Omicron and other variants, with higher neutralizing antibody titers than homo-tri-RBD or the BBIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The results suggest that mos-tri-RBD is highly immunogenic and may serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron. The mosaic strategy, which combines key mutations relevant to immune evasion into a single molecule, provides an effective strategy to achieve broad-spectrum neutralization in a single-component vaccine.
 Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, continues to pose a global health threat due to the development of resistance to antimalarial drugs. One potential solution is the discovery of drugs with novel modes of action. P. falciparum parasites infect human red blood cells, where they digest the host's main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase PfA-M17 is involved in the last step of this digestive pathway, providing parasites with free amino acids for growth, many of which are likely to originate from hemoglobin. Loss of PfA-M17 results in parasites exhibiting multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage, indicating its importance in parasite survival. PfA-M17 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that forms a homo-hexamer in its active form, with optimal function at neutral pH. It is believed that hemoglobin-derived peptides are exported from the digestive vacuole into the parasite cytoplasm, either through the chloroquine-resistance transporter or by other unidentified mechanisms. Once in the cytoplasm, it is hypothesized that hemoglobin-derived peptides are digested by PfA-M17, although it is also possible that PfA-M17 plays an additional role in the catabolic turnover of peptides from other origins. PfA-M17 and PfA-M1 are both able to cleave single amino acids from the N-terminus of small peptide chains, with PfA-M1 showing a broad substrate specificity and PfA-M17 showing almost exclusive selectivity for leucine and tryptophan in vitro. Leucine is an important substrate of the isoleucine transporter at the parasite membrane and may be important for the uptake of isoleucine across the parasite membrane. Repeated attempts to knockout Pfa-m17 have failed, suggesting it is essential for intra-erythrocytic growth. Its ortholog could be disrupted in both Plasmodium berghei and Toxoplasma gondii, leading to a significant effect on parasite replication. To functionally characterize PfA-M17 and determine its contribution to P. falciparum survival, a conditional knockdown parasite line was created using a riboswitch system. This revealed that parasites depleted of PfA-M17 experience a growth delay and fail to expand in culture, subsequently leading to parasite death. A novel and specific small molecule inhibitor to PfA-M17, compound 3, was also designed and synthesized. Parasites treated with this inhibitor demonstrate a similar growth phenotype to PfA-M17 knockdown parasites. Loss of PfA-M17, either by knockdown or treatment with 3, resulted in multiple hemozoin fragments that were representative of multiple digestive vacuoles within trophozoite stage parasites. Metabolomic analysis of knockdown and 3-treated parasites revealed that peptides accumulating after the depletion of PfA-M17 are likely to originate from hemoglobin, indicating that PfA-M17 plays a role in the final stages of its digestion.
 Early hematopoiesis is a continuous process involving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that gradually differentiate toward specific lineages. Aging and myeloid malignant transformation are characterized by changes in the composition and regulation of HSPCs. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to characterize an enriched population of human HSPCs obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals. Based on their transcriptional profile, changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging and differences in their functionality were identified. Trajectory inference revealed altered gene expression dynamics during cell differentiation, which could explain aging-associated changes in hematopoiesis.Next, key regulators of transcription were analyzed by constructing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and detecting regulons specifically active in elderly individuals. Comparison of transcriptional programs and GRNs in normal HSPCs and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) HSPCs allowed the identification of regulons specifically active in MDS cases, suggesting a role of these transcription factors in the pathogenesis of the disease.The findings demonstrate that the combination of single-cell technologies with computational analysis tools enables the study of complex biological systems such as early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with perturbations such as aging and malignant transformation. Additionally, the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients.
 The ability to learn and distinguish between relevant and irrelevant stimuli is crucial for animal survival. One mechanism that helps animals ignore irrelevant stimuli is latent inhibition, which occurs when an animal is exposed to a stimulus without reinforcement, resulting in delayed learning when that stimulus is later associated with a reward. Honey bees exhibit latent inhibition towards an odor when it is presented without food reinforcement, and individual differences in latent inhibition exist within a colony, with a genetic basis.To investigate the underlying mechanisms of individual differences in latent inhibition, researchers selected two honey bee lines for high and low latent inhibition, respectively. They mapped a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) for latent inhibition to a region of the genome containing the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Disruption of Amtyr1 signaling through pharmacological blockade or RNAi qualitatively changed the expression of latent inhibition, suggesting that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the Central Nervous System (CNS).The results identified a distinct Amtyr1-based modulatory pathway for nonassociative learning, and a model was proposed for how Amtyr1 acts as a gain control to modulate hebbian plasticity at defined synapses in the CNS. These findings also have implications for understanding intracolonial learning differences among individuals that benefit colony survival.In summary, latent inhibition is a crucial mechanism for animals to learn to ignore irrelevant stimuli and attend to those that enhance survival. Honey bees exhibit individual differences in latent inhibition, which have a genetic basis and are modulated by the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Disruption of Amtyr1 signaling affects the expression of latent inhibition, suggesting that AmTYR1 plays a role in modulating inhibitory processing in the CNS. The findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in latent inhibition and its implications for colony survival.
 This study introduces a non-invasive imaging modality using endogenous autofluorescence signatures of metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD to distinguish all seven airway epithelial cell types in real time. The methodology allows for the identification of cell types without the need for genetic labels and sometimes with greater accuracy than destructive immunofluorescent approaches. The researchers also discovered the existence of secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs) in the airway, which are likely to play an important role in the immunologic response to antigens present in the airway lumen. The methodology can be optimized for assessing human airway specimens and for the real-time assessment of disease-specific physiologic parameters and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. However, it must be re-optimized in each new experimental setting and machine learning algorithms will require re-training. The training set provided in this manuscript will be a useful validation for native mouse tracheal epithelia. The study was conducted using C57BL/6J, MT-MG, and Cd11c-mCherry mice, and all procedures were performed with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols. The researchers used an Olympus FVMPE-RS multiphoton laser scanning microscope equipped with a MaiTai HPDS-O IR pulsed laser and an INSIGHT X3-OL IR pulsed laser for imaging. The autofluorescence images were obtained using a MATLAB algorithm to normalize the Z-axis to the basement membrane, and morphological measurements were conducted as described in the study. The researchers used k-nearest neighbor, multinomial logistic regression, and XGBoost algorithms to classify cell types using features such as FAD, NADH, FAD/NADH ratio, nuclear position, X-length, Y-length, Z-length, XY aspect ratio, YZ aspect ratio, SD of the fluorescence ratio from midpoint above, and SD of fluorescence ratio bottom. The study also includes the use of methacholine to stimulate SAP formation and the investigation of the functions of airway SAPs.
 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of the adult heart to regenerate after injury. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of m6A in heart regeneration remains unclear. To study m6A function in heart regeneration, Mettl3 expression was modulated in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of Mettl3 significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice. Conversely, Mettl3 overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice. Through conjunct analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA-seq, Fgf16 was identified as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification during postnatal heart regeneration. Mettl3 negatively regulates Fgf16 mRNA expression in an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent manner. Silencing of Fgf16 suppressed cardiomyocyte proliferation, but overexpression of ΔFgf16, in which the m6A consensus sequence was mutated, significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice. These findings demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces Fgf16 mRNA levels through an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent pathway, thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.
 The risk of second primary cancers (SPCs) is increasing among cancer survivors, but the underlying causal relationship remains unclear. To investigate this, a pan-cancer association study was conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the UK Biobank (UKB). The study identified significant cross-correlations between different cancers, with 11 significant associations found after harmonizing SIR and MR results. Notable findings include an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients initially diagnosed with oral pharyngeal cancer (SIRSEER = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.31, ORradial-MR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.13-1.30, p = 6.00 × 10-3; ORcause = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.05-1.31, p = 8.90 × 10-3), an increased risk of soft tissue cancer in patients initially diagnosed with ovary cancer (SIRSEER = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.08-2.60, ORradial-MR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.22-1.58, p = 1.07 × 10-3; ORcause = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.16-1.58, p = 0.01), and an increased risk of lung cancer and myeloma in patients initially diagnosed with kidney cancer (SIRSEER = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.22-1.35, ORradial-MR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.08-1.27, p = 6.60 × 10-3; ORcause = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.02-1.31, p = 0.05; SIRSEER = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.33-1.78, ORradial-MR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.21-2.45, p = 0.02; ORcause = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.04-2.34, p = 0.02). The study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai, and The University of Hong Kong. The increasing prevalence of cancers and prolonged survival due to improved treatments make it essential to understand the relationship between primary and secondary cancers to optimize treatment and improve survivorship.
 This study aimed to develop a novel behavioral paradigm for macaque monkeys to investigate gaze biases in value-based decision-making, as previous paradigms contained restrictions that interfere with natural gaze patterns and limit the ability to identify the relationship between gaze behavior and choice. The study identified gaze biases in monkeys that were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in humans, and these biases were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework. The findings suggest a common mechanism that can explain gaze-related choice biases across species and open the way for mechanistic studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.The study involved two adult male rhesus monkeys, Monkey C and Monkey K, who were implanted with an orthopedic head restraint device and performed a value-based decision-making task while head-restrained and seated in front of a computer monitor. Eye position was monitored using a non-invasive infrared eye-tracker. The monkeys were encouraged to direct their attention towards the target that appeared first by temporally staggering the onset of the two targets in 30% of the trials. The monkeys directed their initial fixation to the cued target on 96% of the staggered-onset trials.The study used the Gaze-Weighted Linear Accumulator Model (GLAM) to gain insight into potential mechanisms underlying choice and gaze behavior in the task. The GLAM modeling was conducted using the glambox toolbox and revealed that the multiplicative model provided a better fit than the additive model, suggesting that gaze amplifies the value of the attended target. The findings suggest that gaze plays an active role in the decision process and that the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood, making it essential to identify the neural origins of this behavior.
 This study investigates the metabolic response of the generalist insect species Drosophila suzukii to various fruit diets using untargeted metabolomics. The study found that flies developed on different fruits have mostly identical metabolomes, indicating metabolic generalism. However, quantitative levels of ions are critical for correctly classifying fly metabolomes according to diet. The study also identified diet-specific fly ions using Elastic Net regularization and found that most of these ions were present in similar quantities in their respective fruit and flies who consumed it. Some diet-specific metabolites were produced de novo by flies, while others were accumulated or sequestered. The results demonstrate that only some fruit metabolites are metabolized or excreted, while others tend to accumulate in flies. The study also found that organic acids and flavonoids were ubiquitous in plants and were detected in flies, with specific substituents modulating the bioactivity of flavonoids and potentially mediating differential developmental responses to fruit diet in D. suzukii. The study concludes that the metabolomes of flies fed on different fruits are mostly identical, and metabolic generalism is a mechanism promoting diet breadth in D. suzukii. The study also suggests that more studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of the biochemical diversity of specific plant organs and the physiological origin and maintenance of diet generalism and specialization.
 Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague, evolved from its ancestor Yersinia pseudotuberculosis approximately 6000-7000 years ago through a series of genetic changes that enabled it to become an arthropod-borne pathogen. One of the key adaptations was the development of the capacity for biofilm-dependent blockage of the flea foregut, which facilitated transmission by flea bite. A frameshift mutation in the rcsD gene, which is part of the Rcs signalling pathway, is an important evolutionary step that facilitated this adaptation.The rcsD gene in Y. pestis has undergone a frameshift mutation after codon 642 due to a single nucleotide deletion. However, the N-terminal region of rcsDpe is still functional, as deletion of this region reduced biofilm formation and Congo red (CR) pigmentation. Replacement of rcsDpe with rcsDpstb and rcsB deletion significantly increased biofilm formation.The rcsD frameshift mutation followed the emergence of rcsA pseudogenization, and it further altered the canonical Rcs phosphorylation signal cascade, fine-tuning biofilm production to be conducive with retention of the pgm locus in modern lineages of Y. pestis.In summary, a frameshift mutation in rcsD is an important evolutionary step that fine-tuned biofilm production to ensure perpetuation of flea-mammal plague transmission cycles. This mutation resulted in the production of a small protein composing the C-terminal RcsD histidine-phosphotransferase domain (designated RcsD-Hpt) and full-length RcsD. The rcsD frameshift mutation occurred after the emergence of rcsA pseudogenization and altered the Rcs phosphorylation signal cascade, fine-tuning biofilm production to be conducive with retention of the pgm locus in modern lineages of Y. pestis.
 This study investigated the peer review process in scientific publishing using 572 peer review reports from 200 papers published in Nature Communications within the neuroscience field. The research utilized OpenAI's ChatGPT to analyze the sentiment and politeness of the reviews, finding that ChatGPT's scores were consistent and accurate, outperforming conventional lexicon- and rule-based algorithms. The study revealed that evaluations of the same manuscript varied considerably among different reviewers, suggesting subjectivity in the peer review process. Additionally, the study found that first authors with a female name received less polite reviews than first authors with a male name, although this did not affect the favorability of their reviews. Female senior authors received more favorable reviews than male senior authors, which may be due to selection bias elsewhere in the publishing process. The study underscores the potential of generative artificial intelligence to evaluate and enhance scientific peer review, leading to a more equitable and just academic system. However, limitations include the selection bias present in the dataset and the focus on the neuroscience field. Future studies may expand upon this initial work by incorporating larger sample sizes and encompassing diverse scientific disciplines and journals.
 This study demonstrates that continuous intraperitoneal administration of interferon-alpha (IFNα) in mice reduces liver metastatic spreading of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and improves survival. The antimetastatic effects of IFNα do not rely on its direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation or metastatic cell growth within the liver. Instead, IFNα acts on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs), including liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), to negatively control trans-sinusoidal migration of CRC cells. This is evidenced by a reduction in the overall LSEC porosity, an enhancement in the subendothelial deposition of basal membrane components, and an upregulation of LYVE-1, a marker of hepatic capillarization. The results suggest that IFNα therapy may transform a metastases-prone liver into a metastases-resistant organ by stimulating HECs/LSECs to shape a vascular antimetastatic barrier. The study also proposes that this strategy could be used as perioperative neoadjuvant immunotherapy in CRC patients undergoing resection of their primary tumor who are at high risk for developing metachronous liver metastases.
 This study aimed to investigate the impact of vaccination on influenza A virus (IAV) evolution in pigs by analyzing the genetic diversity and reassortment of IAV in vaccinated and nonvaccinated pigs. The researchers used bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from a previous vaccine-challenge study, where pigs were co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains using a co-infection seeder pig model. Thirteen BALF samples were selected for viral plaque purification, and 202 IAV plaques were isolated and whole-genome sequenced.The results showed that among the 202 plaques, 148 (73.3%) were the parental virus-challenge strains, and 54 (26.7%) were IAV reassortants. Prime-boost vaccinated pigs had fewer reassortant viruses than nonvaccinated pigs, likely due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses. However, direct sequencing from BALF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions.The findings suggest that vaccination helps reduce the risk of IAV co-infection in pigs and decreases the number and diversity of genotypes of reassortant viruses generated in pig lungs. However, vaccine-induced immunity may drive variant selection on IAV genomes, which could affect the within-host genetic diversity and expand the antigenic diversity of IAV populations. Further studies are needed to fully understand the complex relationship between vaccination, IAV evolution, and the emergence of novel antigenic variants with zoonotic and pandemic potential.
 This study investigated the role of place cell remapping in memory formation by examining the effects of scopolamine, an amnestic drug, on place cell activity and population coding in the hippocampus of rats. The study used a large-field-of-view version of the UCLA Miniscope to image neurons in the hippocampal CA1 layer during maze sessions. The results showed that scopolamine impaired aversive learning, as evidenced by a failure to exhibit long-term retention of avoidance behavior. However, it did not acutely disrupt spatial tuning of CA1 neurons or shock-evoked responses. Instead, scopolamine reduced the percentage of recurring place cells and degraded the between-session similarity of recurring place cell population vectors. This disruption of between-session place cell stability was similar in male and female rats. The study also found that place cell remapping occurred more in rats that underwent acquisition and extinction of avoidance than in control rats, but the spatial distribution of place fields remained unchanged by remapping. The findings suggest that place cell remapping may play a functional role in storing memories of aversive encounters, but potential confounds must be considered. The study also highlights the importance of controlling for behavioral differences between sessions and normalizing speed and occupancy distributions to accurately assess place cell remapping.
 HIV-1 infection triggers inflammasome activation in humanized mice, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. This early inflammasome response is crucial for HIV-1 pathogenesis, as it drives HIV-1-induced CD4+ T cells death and promotes HIV-1 replication. Viremic mice demonstrated higher levels of IFI16 and AIM2 expression, two key DNA sensors involved in inflammasome activation, in their organs than non-viremic mice. The upregulation of IFI16 and AIM2 was common in all three organs, with a maximal transcription at 24 days post-infection. Delayed transcriptomic changes occurring around day 24 post-infection were observed, notably in the spleen. Furthermore, IFI16 expression was higher in viremic mice and correlated with corresponding tissue viral RNA copies and CD4+ T cells percentage in the blood. Similarly, AIM2 reached a maximum of expression at day 24 post-infection in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the spleen and was expressed at higher levels in viremic mice. AIM2 expression also correlated with viral RNA copies in the same organ and inversely with CD4+ T cells percentage in the blood. Other inflammasome-related genes, such as ASC and CASP1, reached a maximum of expression 24 days post-infection and their expression was associated with HIV-1 replication in the bone marrow for ASC and HIV-1 pathogenesis for ASC in the bone marrow and the spleen and for CASP-1 in the lymph nodes.To confirm inflammasome activation in huNSG mice upon HIV-1 infection, plasma levels of inflammasome-related cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-6, IP-10, and TNF-α, were quantified. HIV-1 infection was previously described to induce a rapid and intense cytokine storm involving several pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Concordantly, huNSG mice infected with HIV-1 demonstrated a rapid elevation in the plasma levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-18, and IP-10, but not of IL-6 and TNF-α. IL-18 levels accumulated at day 10 and day 24 post-infection, and viremic mice harbored higher IL-18 levels than non-viremic mice. Furthermore, IL-18 levels correlated with viremia and inversely with CD4+ T cells percentage in the blood. Although IFN-γ and IP-10 concentrations were also higher in viremic mice, plasma levels were not correlated with plasma viral load or CD4+ T cells percentage in the blood. IL-1β levels were below the LOD of the assay for most of the mice blood samples, likely due to its short half-life, low volume of plasma collected in mice, and fast degradation.Treatment of huNSG mice with the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 reduced the levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines induced during early HIV-1 infection. VX-765 decreased the expression of IFI16, AIM2, ASC, and CASP1 genes in the spleen at 11 and 22 days after HIV infection. Importantly, caspase-1 inhibition interfered with HIV-1 replication, as evidenced by lower plasma viral loads and a reduced content of total HIV-1 DNA in the spleen of VX-765-treated mice. Caspase-1 activity was lower in all subsets compared to the spleen, and none of them presented a decreased caspase-1 activity in response to VX-765 treatment. However, splenic CD11c+ and CD14+ cells presented a reduced caspase-1 activity upon VX-765 treatment, while CD4+ and CD8+ T cells presented low levels of caspase-1 activity and did not respond to VX-765 treatment. In the bone marrow, caspase-1 activity was
 This study investigated the hypothesis that pair bond transcriptional signatures erode following long-term partner separation in prairie voles. Opposite-sex and same-sex pairs were cohabited for 2 weeks and then either remained paired or were separated for 48 hours or 4 weeks. The results showed that opposite-sex pair bonded males exhibited increased partner huddle duration between baseline and long-term timepoints, while separated animals did not. However, prior work indicates that pair bond transcription may induce other long-term biological changes that erode more slowly, such as long-lasting epigenetic memory, proteomic and/or structural changes, or transcriptional changes in a key subset of cells. The study also found that pair bond transcription may involve oxytocin signaling in the NAc, and future studies will help shed light on the pain associated with loss and how we integrate grief in order to meaningfully reengage with life. The study used RNAseq and behavior testing to examine the effects of partner separation on pair bond transcription and behavior in prairie voles. The study found that opposite-sex pairs showed a significant decrease in partner preference after long-term separation, while same-sex pairs did not. The study also found that opposite-sex pairs showed a significant decrease in partner huddling latency after long-term separation, while same-sex pairs did not. The study used a custom Python-based script to analyze frame-by-frame behavioral data and calculate the time spent huddling with each tethered animal. The study used RNAseq to examine the effects of partner separation on gene expression in the NAc and found that opposite-sex pairs showed a significant decrease in gene expression related to glia and extracellular matrix organization, synapse organization, and vesicle docking after long-term separation. The study also found that opposite-sex pairs showed an increase in gene expression related to myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation after long-term separation. The study used a vTRAP construct to specifically examine neuronal transcriptional changes in the NAc and found that opposite-sex pairs showed a significant decrease in gene expression related to dopamine signaling, synaptic plasticity, and vesicle trafficking after long-term separation. The study also found that opposite-sex pairs showed an increase in gene expression related to estrogen receptor signaling and oxidative phosphorylation pathways after long-term separation. The study used a publicly available snRNAseq dataset to validate the neuronal enriched gene list and found that the gene list was predominantly expressed in neuronal cell types.

 This study investigates the emergence of motor variability from motor primitives during early human development using longitudinal EMG recordings of leg muscles during locomotor and rhythmic movements. The researchers found that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development, with infants having a minimal number of motor primitives but generating maximal motor variability in the neonatal period due to variable activations of these primitives. However, toddlers generate less variability despite the existence of more primitives due to more regularity within their activation. These results suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration as soon as birth by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives that later fraction and become more consistently activated by the motor system. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for motor exploration and the maturation of the motor system through development.
 The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to analyze Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This meta-analysis, which includes 13,000 Typhi genomes, highlights the spread of genotype 4.3.1 (H58) in Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa, while distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in other regions. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and travel-associated sequences can provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020), but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium aims to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi and inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies. The meta-analysis was not funded specifically but was supported by fellowships from the European Union, the Wellcome Trust, and the National Health and Medical Research Council.
 In Arabidopsis thaliana, plants undergo vernalization, a process triggered by long-term winter cold, to synchronize flowering time with spring. This is achieved through epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor gene, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). During vernalization, CBFs (C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factors) accumulate and bind to CRT/DREs (C-repeat/dehydration-responsive elements) at the 3′-end of FLC, leading to COOLAIR expression. COOLAIR is an antisense transcript that removes active histone marks from FLC chromatin, contributing to FLC silencing. However, COOLAIR is not required for the vernalization process as shown by the normal vernalization response of cbfs and FLCΔCOOLAIR mutants. CBFs are upregulated by long-term cold exposure and mediate long-term cold-induced COOLAIR expression, indicating that the cold signaling pathways for short-term and long-term cold responses are not sharply distinguishable.
 This study used single-genome proviral sequencing to investigate the distribution of HIV-1 reservoir cells in multiple anatomical compartments from autopsy samples of three individuals living with HIV-1 and receiving antiretroviral therapy until their decease. Intact proviruses were detected in lymph nodes and, to a lesser extent, in the colon, suggesting the involvement of gut-associated lymphoid tissues. The study is among the first to identify near full-length proviral sequences from the central nervous system in two study participants, supporting the hypothesis that CNS cells can serve as reservoirs for long-term HIV-1 persistence despite antiretroviral therapy. Large clones of virally infected cells were broadly disseminated across multiple tissues, and in selected cases, involved cells from the CNS, suggesting that HIV-1 reservoir cells seeded to the brain via hematogenous spread can proliferate in the local tissue microenvironment of the CNS. HIV-1 can invade the CNS within days after infection, and infected cells may frequently be short-lived but some infected CD4 T cells in the brain may persist long-term. Microglial cells, the main innate immune cell population of the CNS, may represent a primary cellular site for long-term HIV-1 persistence in the CNS due to their long half-life, ability to divide and self-renew, and high cell-intrinsic susceptibility to HIV-1. The study identified intact proviruses in basal ganglia and periventricular white matter, suggesting that HIV-1 may preferentially persist in these anatomical compartments in the CNS. Clones of HIV-1-infected cells were distributed across different autologous CNS tissues, suggesting local spread of virally infected cells through clonal proliferation within the immune microenvironment of the CNS. The study did not determine which cell types were infected by HIV-1 and responsible for clonal expansion of viral reservoir cells in the CNS but it is possible that infected microglia are involved. The study identified CXCR4-tropic proviruses exclusively in one study participant, who was diagnosed with HIV-1 25 years prior to starting antiretroviral therapy and died 10 months after ART commencement, suggesting that viral CXCR4 tropism most likely resulted from 'coreceptor switch' frequently occurring during advanced stages of immune deficiency. The study also identified a high number of HIV-1 proviruses isolated from the prostate, which had the second highest proviral frequency among all analyzed tissues in study participant 2, second only to lymph node samples. The prostate can represent a tissue reservoir for HIV-1. The study has several limitations, including the small sample size, limited tissue sizes available for investigation, and the inability to study phylogenetic associations between tissue reservoirs of HIV-1 relative to viral species circulating in peripheral blood. However, the work supports the persistence of genome-intact HIV-1 in many tissues, including CNS tissues, emphasizing the difficulties in finding strategies to effectively eliminate HIV-1 from the human body in clinical settings.
 Circadian clocks are highly conserved transcriptional regulators that control 24-hour oscillations in gene expression, physiological function, and behavior in almost every tissue. They are thought to control tissue-specific gene expression and function, synchronized by the brain clock. Many disease states are associated with loss of circadian regulation, but it is currently difficult to monitor tissue-specific clock function in intact organisms. In this study, researchers developed a method called Locally Activatable BioLuminescence (LABL) to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live, intact Drosophila.Using LABL, they observed that specific neuronal and peripheral clocks exhibit distinct transcriptional properties. Loss of the receptor for PDF, a circadian neurotransmitter critical for the function of the brain clock, disrupts circadian locomotor activity but not all tissue-specific circadian clocks. Peripheral clocks in non-neuronal tissues were less stable after the loss of PDF signaling but continued to oscillate. Distinct clocks exhibit differences in their loss of oscillatory amplitude or their change in period, depending on their anatomical location, mutation, or fly age.LABL is an effective tool that allows for rapid, affordable, and direct real-time monitoring of individual clocks in vivo. It offers high spatial and temporal resolution of clock oscillations and can be used to investigate the effects of mutations and environmental factors on distinct clocks. The researchers believe that this technology will be critical in the interrogation of distinct circadian clocks in future studies, particularly in monitoring peripheral clock function during disease progression in Drosophila.
 This study investigates the function of the yeast protein Vrl1, which was previously thought to be non-functional due to an inactivating mutation in commonly used strains. Vrl1 was found to have features of a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms an obligate complex with Vin1, the paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5. The VINE complex, consisting of Vrl1 and Vin1, occupies endosomal tubules and redistributes a conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like protein from endosomes. VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome. The VINE complex is important for maintaining endosomal identity and is responsible for recruiting effectors, including coat proteins and vesicle tethers, to the endosomal membrane. The study also highlights the importance of the VPS9-domain GEFs Muk1 and Vps9 in stimulating the endosomal Rabs Vps21, Ypt52, and Ypt53 to perform downstream functions.
 This study aimed to understand the effects of temperature on interaction strengths between marine fish species using quantitative fish environmental DNA (eDNA) metababarcoding in the Boso Peninsula, Japan. The researchers collected eDNA samples twice a month for two years from 11 coastal sites and analyzed the data using nonlinear time series analytical tools. They detected fish-fish interactions as information flow between eDNA time series and quantified pairwise interaction strengths. Water temperature influenced fish-fish interaction strengths, and the impact varied among fish species. For example, interaction strengths of Halichoeres tenuispinis and Microcanthus strigatus increased with water temperature, while those of Engraulis japonicus and Girella punctata decreased. The findings demonstrate a practical research framework to study the effects of environmental variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature, contributing to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.
 The study examines the microstructure and crystallography of eggshells from all major clades of Palaeognathae, including extinct taxa, using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results reveal detailed information about the previously categorized ostrich-, rhea-, and tinamou-style morphotypes of palaeognath eggshells. The rhea-style eggshell is homologous, while the ostrich- and tinamou-style morphotypes are best interpreted as homoplastic morphologies. The analysis also provides implications for ornithology and palaeontology, aiding in the understanding of the evolution of modern and extinct dinosaur eggshells, and offering useful archives for comparative contrasts in various fields such as palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, geochronology, and zooarchaeology.The study emphasizes the importance of palaeognath eggshells as a valuable subject for evolutionary biology due to their long-term preservation in the fossil record. The evolution of eggs and eggshells within a single dinosaur clade is not well understood, and homoplastic similarities can complicate the interpretation. The current study documents the evolution of eggs among modern avian dinosaurs, providing insights into the evolution among extinct taxa. Palaeognathae, one of the two major clades of modern birds, is characterized by larger, flightless birds with distinctive eggshell microstructures compared to those of Neognathae. The eggs and eggshells of Palaeognathae might be more appropriate modern analogues for those of flightless non-avian dinosaors than those of volant Neognathae due to the influence of flight on egg mass and eggshell thickness.The phylogeny of Palaeognathae has undergone significant revisions since the late 2000s, mainly due to advancements in molecular approaches. The current study revisits palaeognath eggs and eggshells with a revised phylogeny of Palaeognathae, offering a comprehensive and updated understanding of avian egg evolution. The findings provide insights into the evolution of palaeognath eggshells, their implications for ornithology and palaeontology, and potential future research topics.
 Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are important for communication and navigation in various animal species, including rodents, bats, frogs, cetaceans, and primates. USVs have diverse functions, such as distress calls, courtship signals, territorial defense signals, private communication, and echolocation. In mice, USVs have been extensively studied due to their social and affective significance and the growing mechanistic understanding of their neuronal circuitry. Mouse USVs are increasingly used in neurodevelopmental and neurolinguistic research as a behavioral measure.Reliably attributing USVs to their emitter during close interactions is a significant challenge, as imprecise localization can lead to incorrect assumptions about the behavior of the animals. To address this challenge, a hybrid ultrasonic tracking system, Hybrid Vocalization Localizer (HyVL), was developed. HyVL integrates a high-resolution acoustic camera with high-quality ultrasonic microphones to achieve millimeter precision (~3.4-4.8 mm, 91% assigned) in localizing USVs, which is three times better than other systems.Using mouse courtship interactions as an example, HyVL demonstrated that males and females vocalize in different relative spatial positions, and the fraction of female vocalizations has likely been overestimated previously due to imprecise localization. Furthermore, when two male mice interact with one female, one male takes a dominant role in the interaction, both in terms of the vocalization rate and the location relative to the female.HyVL substantially improves the precision with which social communication between rodents can be studied. It is also affordable, open-source, easy to set up, and reduces the required number of experiments and animals. The system's compact form factor and relatively low hardware costs enable deployment in larger and more natural environments for studying social interaction in various species.
 Sarcomeres are the force-producing units of striated muscles, and their architecture is conserved across animals. In vertebrates, sarcomeres are bordered by two Z-discs, which anchor actin filaments, and myosin filaments are cross-linked at the M-band. The actin and myosin filaments are mechanically linked by the titin protein, which spans half a sarcomere and determines sarcomere length. Recent evidence suggests that titin is the main sarcomeric component responsible for passive tension in muscles.In Drosophila, the sarcomere architecture is also conserved, but the role of titin in determining sarcomere length and architecture is less well understood. To investigate this, researchers used nanobodies to determine the precise location of two Drosophila titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, in intact flight muscles. They found that Sallimus bridges across the I-band, whereas Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band. The ends of both proteins overlap at the I-band/A-band border, revealing a staggered organization of the two Drosophila titin homologs. This architecture may help to stably anchor Sallimus at the myosin filament and ensure efficient force transduction during flight.The researchers used a series of nanobodies to recognize specific domains of Sallimus and Projectin and combined them with DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to determine their precise location in intact flight muscle sarcomeres. They found that the staggered organization of the two proteins may explain how high mechanical tension can be stably transmitted across the sarcomere and how sarcomere length can be ruled without the presence of a single protein linking the Z-disc to the M-band as observed in vertebrates.In summary, the researchers used nanobodies and DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to investigate the precise location and organization of two Drosophila titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, in intact flight muscle sarcomeres. They found that Sallimus bridges across the I-band, whereas Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band, and the ends of both proteins overlap at the I-band/A-band border. This architecture may help to stably anchor Sallimus at the myosin filament and ensure efficient force transduction during flight.
 This study presents a high-throughput, simple, and low-cost microfluidic method for quantitatively measuring the elastic (storage) and viscous (loss) modulus of individual cells. The method uses a long microfluidic channel with a square cross-section and a high-viscosity fluid to induce large cell deformations and tank-treading motion. The cells' viscoelastic properties are extracted based on a theoretical framework developed by Roscoe (1967) that describes the deformation of a viscoelastic sphere in a viscous fluid under steady laminar flow. The method's accuracy is confirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells.The study demonstrates that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell-cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks. The method can be used for dose-response measurements of drugs that induce actin cytoskeleton disassembly, and the responses are modulated by the cell cycle and the intermediate filament network of the cells.The method involves suspending cells in a high-viscosity fluid and pumping them through a several centimeter long microfluidic channel with a square cross-section. The fluid shear stress induces large cell deformations, which are imaged using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera at frame rates of up to 500 frames/s to achieve a measurement throughput of up to 100 cells/s. The method takes advantage of two physical principles: the shear stress profile inside a long microfluidic channel depends only on the pressure gradient along the channel and the channel geometry, and the shear stress profile does not depend on the viscosity of the cell suspension medium.The method allows for the computation of the cell's viscoelastic properties from the stress-strain relationship and the tank-treading frequency. The elastic modulus characterizes the cell's elastic behavior, while the loss modulus characterizes its viscous behavior. The method provides quantitatively accurate estimates for the elastic and dissipative properties of soft spherical particles.
 This study investigates the role of a specific mutation in the mitofusin 2 (MFN2) gene, R400Q, in cardiomyopathy. MFN2 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein essential for heart development, contraction, and repair. While gene ablation studies have demonstrated that mitofusins are critical for heart development and function, human conditions caused by natural loss-of-function MFN gene mutations have not been reported to cause cardiac involvement. Instead, these mutations have been linked to neuronal diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) or optic degeneration.The study found that the MFN2 R400Q mutation is over-represented in cardiomyopathy among individuals of African descent, and that this mutation is defective in recruiting Parkin to mitochondria, thereby impacting an important mitophagic pathway. Mice engineered to carry the Mfn2 Q400 mutation develop a perinatal cardiomyopathy, while Mfn2 T105M and Mfn2 M376V knock-in mice develop a CMT2A-like neuropathy and normal hearts, respectively.The findings suggest that mitophagic dysfunction is a new mechanism for cardiomyopathy, and that targeted investigations of other genetic mitophagy defects as cardiac risk modifiers are warranted. The study also supports the concept that different patterns of mitofusin dysfunction underlie organ-specific manifestations of clinical diseases caused by MFN2 mutations.
 This study investigated the hypothesis that early-life exposure to sex-specific olfactory cues from mice can influence their lifespan. Female mice were exposed to odors from adult females from 3 to 60 days of age, and their lifespan was compared to female mice exposed to water or male odors. The results showed that female mice exposed to female odors had an 8% increase in median lifespan and a 9% increase in the age at 90th percentile compared to the control group. The interaction term in the Cox regression analysis did not achieve significance, indicating that the odor effect did not depend on genotype. The study adds to the growing evidence that non-genetic factors, such as early-life environmental influences, can impact late-life health and lifespan in mammals. The mechanism for the lifespan effect in the FU-treated female mice is not yet known and warrants further investigation.
 This study investigated the effects of commonly used doses of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and a novel DREADD actuator, compound 21 (C21), on sleep in wild-type C57BL/6J mice. The results showed that both CNO and C21 suppressed REM sleep relative to NREM sleep, affected sleep architecture, and increased sleep state stability and continuity. These effects cannot be fully explained by back-metabolism to clozapine alone but might result from off-target binding to endogenous receptors. The findings have important implications for the future application of chemogenetics in sleep research and neuroscience.The study used 16 young adult male C57BL/6J mice, 13 of which were implanted for combined experiments involving procedures for this project and related work. All animals were implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes and had a rest interval of at least 3 days between experiments. The animals received intraperitoneal injections of CNO or saline in a counterbalanced order, with a 72 hr rest interval between the first two experimental sessions. Seven animals also received a 3 mg/kg C21 injection in a fifth experimental session.EEG/EMG recordings were performed using the 128 Channel Neurophysiology Recording System and the electrophysiological recording software Synapse. Raw data was stored on a local computer in 24 hr recording blocks and visually scored in individual 4 s epochs using the Sleep Sign for Animals software.The results showed that CNO and C21 both led to a suppression of REM sleep relative to NREM sleep, affected sleep architecture, and increased sleep state stability and continuity. These effects were consistent with more consolidated sleep and bore striking similarities with those previously reported for clozapine in rats and humans.The study suggests that the DREADD actuators, CNO and C21, have sleep modulatory effects which cannot be fully explained by back-metabolism to clozapine alone but might result from off-target binding to endogenous receptors. This is the first demonstration that DREADD actuators that do not convert to clozapine can elicit relevant behavioural effects in DREADD-free animals. The findings have important implications for the future application of chemogenetics in sleep research and neuroscience.The study also highlights the need to use non-DREADD-expressing controls, even when novel actuators are used that cannot convert to clozapine. Considering the sensitivity of sleep architectural parameters to CNO and C21 demonstrated here, our work reveals a new opportunity of using simple EEG/EMG sleep screening to assess the pharmacological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators in vivo. The experimental refinements of the DREADD approach, plus novel technological improvements, will unleash the full potential of this powerful tool in behavioural neuroscience and help pave the way for its clinical application.
 The microfluidic multiplexed chemotaxis device (MCD) is a novel tool designed for high-throughput screening of bacterial responses to a range of chemostimulant concentrations. The MCD uses a single pressure source to serially dilute a chemostimulus with a single buffer input, producing five logarithmically separated chemical solutions. Simultaneous chemotaxis assays are fast and efficient compared to conventional devices and eliminate variability due to multiple culture preparations and potential changes in cell cultures. The MCD design is amenable to modifications, such as alteration of chemical concentrations, gradients, and flows, and increased multiplexing. The MCD was fabricated using two-layer soft lithography with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and validated using epifluorescence microscopy. The MCD enables robust and efficient quantification of the chemotactic responses of various bacterial species to different chemostimulants, simplifying the labor-intensive chemotaxis screening process. The MCD could also be applied to accelerate microfluidic approaches to human health studies and meet the high-throughput demands of chemical synthesis, screening, and testing with living cells. The MCD was fabricated using standard single and two-layer photolithography and multilayer photolithography with SU-8 photoresist. The final channel heights for the fabricated MCD dilution layer were 90-94.5 μm for the main channel and 37-38.5 μm for the herringbone ridges, while the cell injection layer was 71-73 μm high. The MCD was pre-treated by flowing a 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumen solution to reduce cell adhesion to the microchannel surfaces and then washed with ASW before use. Fluid flow was driven by a single pressure controller, and pressures were scaled down for P. haloplanktis experiments. Between each chemotaxis assay, the fluid inputs were flowed for a minimum of 2 minutes to stratify cell, chemostimulus, and buffer streams in the observation channels. Upon halting the flow, a monotonic concentration profile was established in each observation channel due to the diffusion of the chemostimulus. The spatio-temporal evolution of the bacterial distribution was determined by imaging the cells using phase-contrast microscopy with a sCMOS camera for approximately 10 minutes. An automated computer-controlled stage was used to cyclically move the microscope field of view to each observation channel 75 times, producing an effective imaging period of 8 seconds for each observation channel. Each experiment was technically replicated at least three times with the same culture and repeated on different days with freshly grown cells. For validation of the MCD, a conventional single assay (SA) microfluidic device was designed with a similar geometry to the individual MCD observation channels. The SA chemotaxis devices were used to validate the MCD for the well-established chemotactic behavior of V. alginolyticus to the chemoattractant serine. The SA devices were fabricated in a single layer using soft lithography, and they were pre-treated with a 0.5% (w/v) BSA solution and flushed with ASW prior to experiments. The SA chemotaxis devices were used to validate the MCD for the well-established chemotactic behavior of V. alginolyticus to the chemoattractant serine. The three inlets of the single assay device carried the chemoattractant dissolved in ASW, V. alginolyticus suspended in ASW, and ASW, respectively. The three solutions were flow stratified for a minimum of 2 minutes using a syringe pump, whereby flow rates were controlled by syringe size to maintain a 4:1:4 ratio of the stream widths. In an identical manner to the MCD, a chemostimulus gradient develops in the channel via diffusion, and the chemotactic response of the cell population was observed over time. Imaging was performed with phase-contrast microscopy at 1 fps over the course of approximately 10 minutes using a CMOS camera. Sample size in each replicate chemotaxis experiment ranged from 7000 to 16,000 measured cell positions, dependent on the strain used for each particular assay. After completing the initial 10 minute filming period corresponding to the first measurement of a given organism/chemostimulus pairing, technical replicates were achieved in both the MCD and SA devices
 This study investigates the role of Elavl1, an RNA-binding protein, during cranial neural crest specification using the chick embryo model. Elavl1 is essential for maintaining cranial neural crest specification by stabilizing the Wnt antagonist Draxin through 3′-UTR interaction. Loss of Elavl1 and Draxin disrupts multiple nodes of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) required for neural crest specification, including those driven by Wnt and BMP. The data suggest that Elavl1 acts as a point of integration to coordinate signaling from parallel but independent GRNs. Elavl1 is known to stabilize RNAs via 3′-UTR interaction, and this study aligns well with previous work in other contexts. However, unlike prior high-throughput studies that found many RNAs directly bound by Elavl1, this study identified a single biologically relevant target of Elavl1 during neural crest specification. The study also speculates that Elavl1 likely intersects with additional GRNs following specification and may have additional targets and roles beyond Draxin stabilization. The findings provide insights into the critical role of post-transcriptional regulation in neural crest development and the importance of Elavl1 in coordinating signaling from parallel but independent GRNs.
 Breathing is essential for life and is controlled by complex neural networks and cellular mechanisms in the brainstem and spinal cord. The respiratory rhythm is generated by oscillatory populations in the brainstem, which are then relayed to phrenic motor neurons (MNs) in the spinal cord. Phrenic MNs provide the sole innervation to the diaphragm, a muscle critical for bringing oxygenated air into the lungs during inspiration. The principles governing the assembly of respiratory circuits are unknown, but recent research suggests that coordinated activity of type I (N-cadherin) and type II (Cdh6, Cdh9, and Cdh10) cadherins is required for robust respiratory motor output.Both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons require this combinatorial cadherin code to establish proper phrenic MN cell body positioning and dendritic orientation. Inactivation of cadherins in MNs during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. These findings demonstrate that cadherins are vital to respiratory circuit assembly and function and suggest a model where cadherin-mediated adhesive recognition dictates wiring specificity through multifaceted functions in dendritic organization and molecular recognition.
 This study demonstrates that the spread of misinformation on social media platforms is facilitated by the existing incentive structure, where social rewards (in the form of "likes" and "shares") are dissociated from the veracity of the information. To combat this, the researchers tested the efficacy of an intervention where users are given the option to react to posts using "trust" and "distrust" buttons. The hypothesis is that people will use these buttons to discern true from false information more so than existing engagement options, creating an environment where rewards and punishments are more directly associated with the veracity of information.The study involved 951 participants who engaged in simulated social media platforms where they encountered true and false information. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to use "trust" and "distrust" buttons to discern true from false information, and the results showed that participants used these buttons in a more discerning manner than existing "like" and "dislike" buttons. In Experiments 2 and 3, new groups of participants were tested in social media platforms that introduced real "trust" and "distrust" feedback from other participants. The results showed that participants shared more true than false information in these environments, indicating that the new feedback structure improved sharing discernment.The study also found that participants who received "trust" feedback were more discerning in their sharing behavior than those who received "like" feedback, and those who received "distrust" feedback were more discerning than those who received "dislike" feedback. The results held when controlling for demographics and political orientation and replicated in an independent sample.The researchers suggest that this intervention could be adopted by social media platforms to reduce the spread of misinformation without reducing engagement. The study provides insights into the cognitive mechanisms that make this intervention effective and suggests that it may also help increase the accuracy of beliefs. The researchers plan to integrate the new incentive structure into existing and future social media platforms to further test the external validity of the findings.
 Microtubules, filamentous polymers central to intracellular transport, can generate force and drive motility directly. During mitosis, dynamic microtubules transport chromosomes by shortening while their disassembling tips remain coupled to the chromosomes via kinetochores. Force generation depends on either biased diffusion or conformational wave mechanisms. The conformational wave hypothesis suggests that curling protofilaments physically hook the kinetochore and pull against it to drive motility. Prior work showed that the amount of mechanical strain energy released by curling protofilaments is sufficient for kinetochore motility, but whether kinetochores harness any of this strain energy remains unclear due to the lack of methods for modifying mechanical or energetic properties of protofilament curls.To investigate this, researchers developed an assay for measuring forces and displacements generated by curling protofilaments. They found that adding magnesium enlarges pulses independently of its acceleration of disassembly, indicating that magnesium directly stabilizes the longitudinal bonds within protofilament curls. Pulses generated by yeast tubulin are larger than those generated by bovine brain tubulin, and a simple mechanical model shows that both the magnesium- and species-dependent changes in pulse energy can be explained solely by increasing the contour lengths of protofilament curls without changing their intrinsic flexural rigidity or curvature. These findings suggest that protofilament flexural rigidity and stored lattice strain are crucial to microtubule function.Microtubules were purified from bovine brain and yeast using two cycles of polymerization and depolymerization. Wild-type yeast αβ-tubulin was purified using nickel affinity and ion exchange chromatography. Tubulin samples for the laser trap assays were prepared, aliquoted, snap-frozen, and shipped on dry ice. Anti-His beads were prepared by incubating streptavidin-coated polystyrene microspheres with biotinylated anti-penta-His antibodies, washed, and stored. For each experiment, a small channel was formed by bonding a KOH-cleaned glass coverslip to a clean glass slide using double-stick tape. Biotinylated bovine serum albumin was incubated in the channel, washed out, and avidin DN was incubated and washed out. GMPCPP-stabilized, biotinylated microtubule seeds were assembled and incubated in the channel. Just prior to each experiment, a small aliquot of anti-His beads was pre-incubated with a mixture of plain and biotinylated BSA, decorated with His6-yeast tubulin, and added to growth buffer containing 10-25 µM bovine tubulin.The optical trap instrument used for the assay consisted of a Nikon inverted microscope, a 1064 nm Nd:YVO4 laser for trapping, a 473 nm laser for microtubule cutting, and custom software written in LabVIEW for instrument control and data acquisition. Suitable beads laterally attached to coverslip-anchored microtubules were identified, and suitable microtubules were firmly anchored by one end to the slide surface and able to freely rotate about their surface anchor without interfering microtubules bundled alongside or crossing along their length. To establish the initial loaded state, the laterally attached bead was trapped, and the microtubule and bead were pulled in the opposite direction of the tether, toward the cutting laser location. The beads were raised slightly above the coverslip surface to ensure the surface did not interfere with measurement. The force clamp was initiated, and microtubule depolymerization was triggered by trimming off the stabilizing cap using the cutting laser. Position signals from the trapped bead were recorded using the force clamp software.Candidate pulses were evaluated for inclusion in data analysis based on their amplitude relative to the standard deviation of the baseline noise. The fraction of events that yielded measurable pulses in bovine microtubule experiments was lower than in yeast microtubule experiments mainly because the pulses were smaller on average and therefore more of them fell below the detection threshold. The force-deflection relationship for multiple protofilaments at a microtubule tip interacting with a bead was calculated by assuming the bead to be an infinitely flat, rigid surface and protofilaments distributed radially about the microtubule axis in a 13-protofilament configuration. The
 Hagfishes, a class of epibenthic jawless vertebrates, produce a unique and effective defensive slime when attacked. This slime is composed of fibrous threads and mucus, which rapidly expand and entrap large volumes of water, clogging the mouth and gills of predators. The evolution of this biomaterial is unclear, but evidence suggests that it may have originated from the epidermis.Large intracellular threads have been identified within a putatively homologous cell type from hagfish epidermis. These threads, which average ~2 mm in length and ~0.5 μm in diameter, are present throughout the hagfish body and are covered by a dense layer of epidermal thread cells. When the skin is damaged, these threads and mucus form an adhesive epidermal slime that is more fibrous and less dilute than the defensive slime.Transcriptome analysis suggests that epidermal threads are ancestral to the slime threads, with gene duplication and divergence generating a diversity of thread genes uniquely expressed in slime glands. The results support an epidermal origin of hagfish slime, which may have been driven by selection for stronger and more voluminous slime.ETCs, an unusual thread-producing cell in hagfish epidermis, are suspected to be homologous to GTCs in the slime glands. These cells produce a dense mass of granules of unknown function in the distal region of the cell, in addition to the threads. While the threads and granules appear to be secretory products, there is no evidence that they are released via merocrine or apocrine modes. A holocrine-like mechanism that depends on cell rupture is more likely.The abundance of ETCs in hagfish skin is significant, with an estimated total of ~1.2 × 10^7 ETCs covering the entire hagfish body, which is ~3.9 times greater than the total number of GTCs from all slime glands combined. The large mucous cells, which occur with a lower density than ETCs, play a role in producing the mucus components of epidermal slime.The helical geometry of epidermal threads has been studied using confocal microscopy, revealing that they are right-handed helices with a mean diameter of 0.35±0.1 μm and a mean pitch angle of 63.5°±5.6°. The threads are capable of plastic deformation and are mechanically robust, with no evidence of threads breaking even when they are sheared under a cover glass. The appearance of loose subfilament structure in some epidermal threads suggests that they may simply be a bundle of individual intermediate filaments.The evolution of slime glands from epidermis is a complex process that involves changes at the cellular level as well as larger scale morphological changes. A possible evolutionary scenario suggests that slime glands evolved through possible invagination of the epidermis, with cells specialized for slow release of mucus having little purpose and being excluded in favor of larger proportions of thread cells and large mucous cells. Future work will explore the morphological and genetic changes associated with the large mucous to gland mucous cell transition as well as the origin of the gland musculature.While an epidermal origin of hagfish slime glands is consistent with the morphological and molecular data presented here, it is not the only possible explanation. Another possibility is that hagfish defensive slime glands arose from cloacal glands, which are found in the dorsal wall of the cloaca and contain both thread and mucous cells. However, the genetic data and analysis are consistent with an epidermal origin for slime thread genes, and by extension, an epidermal origin of slime glands.Identifying other intermediate forms between epidermis and slime glands or finding new intermediate fossils may help to further clarify the evolution pathway from hagfish epidermis to slime glands.
 This study aimed to evaluate the disease-modifying effects of sodium selenate treatment in a rat model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using the kainic acid (KA)-induced post-status epilepticus (SE) model. Sodium selenate is a compound known to activate protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates and reduces hyperphosphorylated tau (h-tau), a neuropathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative conditions, including TLE.Ten-weeks post-SE, rats received sodium selenate, levetiracetam, or vehicle subcutaneous infusions for four weeks. Video-electroencephalogram (vEEG) recordings were acquired before, during, and after treatment to assess seizure occurrence and severity. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM), novel object placement (NOP), and novel object recognition (NOR) tests.The results showed that sodium selenate treatment was associated with a significant reduction in seizure number, cognitive dysfunction, and sensorimotor deficits compared to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, sodium selenate treatment increased PP2A expression, reduced h-tau, and reversed telomere length shortening. Network medicine integration identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with TLE, and the Purple and Yellow modules showed significant correlations with selenate-treated animals.These findings suggest that sodium selenate treatment has disease-modifying effects in an animal model of chronic drug-resistant TLE, making it a promising therapeutic approach for this common and disabling disease. The study's findings, if confirmed in clinical trials, could be paradigm-shifting for the treatment of TLE.
 This study introduces a new concept called 'Skeletal Age' to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for individuals. Using data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register, the study found that all types of fractures were associated with a loss of years of life, indicating that the skeletal age of individuals suffering from a fracture is greater than their chronological age. The findings have important implications, as patients with a fragility fracture have a significantly greater risk of mortality than their counterparts without fracture. The study also adjusted for comorbidities and found that the significant fracture-mortality association remained unchanged, suggesting that the association is unlikely due to comorbidities. The study proposes 'Skeletal Age' as a new metric for communicating the risk of mortality following a fracture, as it quantifies the consequence of a fracture using a natural frequency metric, which is easier and more friendly to doctors and patients than probability-based metrics. The use of 'Skeletal Age' can improve doctor-patient risk communication and potentially lead to preventive changes. The study's findings should be interpreted within the context of their strengths and limitations, including the use of registry-based data, the lack of adjustments for lifestyle factors, and the absence of an examination of the effect of bone metabolism-affecting medications on the assessment of skeletal health. Future research could include a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of 'Skeletal Age' and current metrics in fracture risk communication.
 The study proposes a deep neural network named Brain Extraction Net (BEN) for accurate brain tissue extraction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across different species, modalities, and MR scanners. BEN is a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised network that uses an adaptive batch normalization (AdaBN) strategy and an iterative pseudo-labeling procedure for semi-supervised learning. The network is evaluated on 18 datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans, and outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. BEN improves the robustness of atlas-to-target registration and brain volumetric quantification in neuroimaging and is an open-source and modularly designed toolbox that provides uncertainty maps to quantify the confidence of the network's decisions and to model interrater variability. The study demonstrates the potential of BEN to enhance neuroimaging studies at high throughput for both preclinical and clinical applications.
 Candida albicans, a common human fungal pathogen, utilizes external heme as both an iron source and a heme source through a unique uptake system involving CFEM hemophores. This system includes the capture of heme from host proteins by CFEM hemophores and its transfer across the cell wall to the cell membrane. While the mechanism for heme internalization into the cell was unknown, recent research identified two membrane proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, previously classified as FREs, as being essential for heme uptake. Frp1 is required for heme uptake under all conditions, while Frp2 contributes to heme uptake under alkaline conditions. The Frp1/2-CFEM hemophore pathway represents a new paradigm for heme uptake and utilization.Frp1 and Frp2 are adjacent to and share a promoter region with the CFEM protein genes PGA7 and CSA1, respectively. This synteny is maintained across most fungal genomes, further suggesting a common function in heme acquisition. Frp1 and Frp2 have been previously identified as genes that are highly induced under iron starvation conditions and under alkaline conditions. They are also required for optimal growth on hemin in the distantly related basidiomycete fungal pathogen C. neoformans.Frp1 and Frp2 function both as heme reductases and as heme receptors that bring the heme from the cell surface into the cell. They could function in the transport of heme into the cell as well, as they mediate the uptake of metal-substituted heme analogs such as ZnMP and the toxic metal-substituted PPIX derivatives. The affinity of heme for Frp1 and Frp2 might differ depending on pH, which could explain their differential roles in heme utilization under various conditions.In summary, Frp1 and Frp2 are essential for heme uptake into the cell and represent the missing link between the extracellular CFEM hemophore cascade and the intracellular heme endocytosis pathway to the vacuole. Their function as heme reductases and heme receptors allows for the efficient uptake and utilization of heme by C. albicans.
 The seventh pandemic of diarrheal cholera disease, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae, began in 1960 and is characterized by its environmental persistence and sudden outbreaks. V. cholerae's ability to adapt to changing environments is facilitated by sensory proteins, including ToxR and ToxS, which react to environmental stimuli such as bile acid. The crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS reveals an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. The ToxRS complex exposes a bile binding pocket inside ToxS, which is only properly built upon stabilization by newly formed structural elements of ToxR. The VtrAC complex of V. parahaemolyticus shares structural and functional similarities with ToxRSp, further emphasizing the significance of ToxRS within the recently defined superfamily of co-component signal transduction systems. The findings hold far-reaching implications for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings. ToxR is a transmembrane transcription factor that can function as an activator, co-activator, and repressor. Its periplasmic domain is proposed to act as an environmental sensor, binding bile acids and consequently activating transcription with its cytoplasmic DNA binding domain. ToxS is built of a periplasmic, a transmembrane, and a short cytoplasmic region. The periplasmic domain of ToxS interacts with the periplasmic domain of ToxR, forming a stable heterodimer and protecting ToxR from periplasmic proteolysis and enhancing its activity. The exact mechanism of ToxR functionality is not clear but is proposed to involve binding DNA as a homodimer at the 'tox-boxes' or using a topological DNA recognition mechanism. Bile significantly alters the virulence factor production, but the exact mechanism remains unclear, with studies showing opposite outcomes in regard to up- or downregulation of virulence factors by bile. The ToxRS complex plays a crucial role in Vibrio strains, as it sensitively regulates the expression system, enabling fine-tuning of transcription levels according to small changes in the pathogen's environment.
 The hippocampus is a complex brain structure involved in episodic memory and spatial navigation. Recent studies have identified functional differences along its anterior-posterior axis and its subfields, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences are unclear. To address this, researchers used track-density imaging to examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus. They identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed their degree of connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Using a tailored tractography pipeline, they characterized where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Their results provide new insights into how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, this study represents a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in vivo and informs our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.
 The Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is activated upon detection of cytoplasmic dsDNA by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), leading to the activation of inflammasomes and inflammation. STING binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and activates transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-κB), resulting in increased production of type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The cGAS-STING pathway has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis, as mice deficient for PD-associated proteins PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK) and parkin show a STING-mediated inflammatory phenotype.To test whether chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration, a mouse model with heterozygous expression of the STING genetic variant N153S was used. In these mice, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and dopaminergic axon terminals in the striatum were found to have reduced integrity, along with alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation was observed in juvenile mice, preceding the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and was blunted in mice deficient for inflammasomes but not for signaling by type I interferons.These findings demonstrate that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and targeting the STING pathway could be beneficial in PD and further neurodegenerative diseases. However, the interconnected nature of neuroinflammation signaling was highlighted, as Casp1-/- mice showed strong inhibition of inflammasome signaling but incomplete rescue of microglia activation and neurodegeneration. Further studies are needed to delineate the contributions of STING activation within microglia and neurons and to assess the susceptibility of different brain regions and neuron populations to STING-induced damage.
 This study investigates why tumors recur in patients undergoing complete response following immunotherapy, despite the presence of cytotoxic T-cell immunity. Contrary to the widely held belief that tumors escape T-cell immunity through immunoediting, this work demonstrates that tumor cells form unique transient cell-in-cell structures that are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. These structures are mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells and are characterized by the inner cells maintaining their integrity and viability while the outer cells are often killed. The discovery of this resistance mechanism reveals a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and highlights the need for further research to develop strategies to overcome it. The study was conducted using mouse models and human samples, and the results suggest that this biological process is a central mechanism through which tumor cells evade T-cell immunity and give rise to relapsed tumors.
 This study investigated the cognitive abilities of marmosets, a highly social primate species, in processing Theory of Mind (ToM) animations using eye tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study compared the gaze patterns and brain activations of marmosets and humans while observing Frith-Happé animations, which feature two triangles moving in different conditions: ToM (mental state attribution), Goal-Directed (GD), and Random.The results showed that both humans and marmosets exhibited longer fixations on the large red triangle during ToM animations compared to other conditions. However, humans also allocated more time to the red triangle in GD animations, while marmosets did not show any difference between GD and Random animations. Both species spent the same proportion of time looking at the small blue triangle in all conditions.Functional imaging studies revealed that the observation of ToM compared to Random animations activated extensive and comparable brain networks in both humans and marmosets, including areas typically associated with social cognition. However, humans showed stronger activations in the left hemisphere, while marmosets displayed stronger activations in the right hemisphere.These findings suggest that marmosets, like humans, differentiate between ToM and non-ToM scenarios, but their gaze behavior and neural activations indicate a distinct processing strategy. This study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities and sheds light on potential similarities and differences in ToM processing between marmosets and humans.
 In the fly larval brain, neuroblast lineages provide an excellent in vivo paradigm for investigating gene regulation during developmental transitions. Neuroblasts are the stem cells that generate all the neurons and glia in the larval and adult brain. During neurogenesis, neuroblasts undergo asymmetric division to produce a sibling progeny that commits to generating differentiated cell types. The type II neuroblast lineage, which generates an immature intermediate neural progenitor (immature INP) in every division, is particularly well-suited for mechanistic investigations.Immature INPs initiate INP commitment 60 minutes after asymmetric neuroblast division. During this process, Notch signaling activity is terminated, and the master regulator of INP commitment, earmuff (erm), is activated. The transcription factors FruitlessC (FruC) and FruitlessB (FruB) have been shown to play a role in INP commitment. However, the fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate stemness gene transcription in neuroblasts are not well understood.In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify genes that contribute to the generation of diverse differentiated cell types during neurogenesis. They found that FruC is the predominant Fru isoform expressed in neuroblasts and that it binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in type II neuroblasts, including Notch and its downstream-effector genes that promote stemness in neuroblasts.The authors also found that FruC negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. Identical to fruC loss-of-function, reducing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) activity increases stemness gene activity. These findings suggest that low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.The authors propose that FruC-PRC2-H3K27me3 molecular pathway fine-tunes stemness gene expression in neuroblasts by promoting low-level H3K27me3 enrichment in their cis-regulatory elements. This mechanism is likely to be relevant throughout metazoans.In summary, this study provides new insights into the fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate stemness gene transcription in neuroblasts during developmental transitions. The authors demonstrate that FruC binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in type II neuroblasts and that it negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. These findings suggest that the FruC-PRC2-H3K27me3 molecular pathway fine-tunes stemness gene expression in neuroblasts, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.
 This study reports an unexpected role of neutrophils in the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes under physiological conditions. Contrary to the belief that neutrophils are excluded from apoptotic sites to avoid tissue inflammation, neutrophils were found to be the predominant phagocytes responsible for the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes in an immunologically silent manner. Neutrophils penetrate apoptotic hepatocytes and clear them from the inside, a process termed perforocytosis. Defects in neutrophil-mediated apoptotic clearance have been observed in human autoimmune liver disease, suggesting a role of neutrophils in maintaining tissue homeostasis. The study also found that neutrophils are attracted to apoptotic hepatocytes by cytokines and chemokines secreted by apoptotic cells, specifically IL-1β and IL-8. Inhibition of selectins, but not PECAM, abrogated the neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes, indicating selectins play a critical role during this process. Neutrophil depletion impaired the prompt clearance of apoptotic cells in the mouse liver, leading to an increase in apoptotic bodies and autoantibodies, suggesting a role of defective neutrophil-mediated removal of apoptotic bodies in autoimmune liver disease. Overall, this study adds to the repertoire of other known functions of neutrophils and has implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
 In this study, researchers investigated the spatial organization of premotor interneurons controlling flexion and extension of the ankle in the spinal cord using rabies virus tracing techniques. Contrary to previous expectations, they found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains. This finding challenges the notion that motor instructions are processed in a spatially organized manner among the flexor-extensor circuit components.The researchers used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice to minimize systematic biases associated with each method. They found that the identity and number of starter cells, which are the main determinants of reproducibility in rabies tracing experiments, are difficult to precisely determine using the methods discussed here. However, they noted that muscle identity of infected motor neurons can be inferred by their stereotyped position in the spinal cord.The researchers also noted that the presence of a small number of 'ectopic' motor neurons, which are seen only following high titre injections, does not significantly contribute to the tracing results. They suggested that these 'ectopic' motor neurons likely represent recurrently connected presynaptic motor neurons.The researchers emphasized the importance of full appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach for mapping premotor circuits and interpreting the results obtained. They concluded that despite using five different methods, they have not been able to find evidence that spinal premotor interneurons innervating flexor vs extensor motor neurons are segregated.
 This study aimed to investigate the relationship between respiration, neural activity, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) signals in anesthetized rats. The researchers found that respiration was associated with gamma-band neural oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and gamma-band power in the electrophysiological signal. This respiration-related gamma activity was tightly linked to the rsfMRI signal, as shown by a strong correlation between the gamma power-derived rsfMRI correlation map and the ACC resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) seedmap.Furthermore, the researchers identified a respiration-related rsfMRI network involving key brain regions controlling respiration, such as the piriform cortex, and regions involved in the rodent default mode network (DMN), including the ACC, medial prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, retrosplenial cortex, primary somatosensory cortices, and hippocampus. This network was mediated by gamma-band neural activity, as shown by a decrease in the respiration-related rsfMRI network when gamma power was regressed out.Additionally, the researchers confirmed that the neural activity played a necessary role in the respiration-related rsfMRI network by experimentally silencing the neural activity in the whole brain while maintaining the respiration in the rat. At the isoelectric state, the LFP amplitude and power were close to zero, and rsfMRI data exhibited a flat, noise-like power distribution and no meaningful ACC RSFC.The researchers also distinguished the respiration-related neural network from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts by obtaining the artifactual patterns of fast and slow respiration signals in the rsfMRI data. They found that the slow respiration-related rsfMRI artifact was distinct from the respiration-related neural network, as it was dominantly located around the ventricles and large veins, whereas the respiration-related neural network was mostly located at the gray matter with a distinct spatial pattern.Overall, this study provides new insights into the relationships between respiration, neural activity, and rsfMRI signals and opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between these factors in both healthy and diseased conditions.
 This study investigated how prey profitability influences the foraging strategies of greater mouse-eared bats, a wild predator that primarily gleanes ground-dwelling arthropods but also has the ability to hawk aerial prey. Using miniaturized biologging devices and DNA metabarcoding of feces, the researchers found that bats use two foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures but vastly different success ratios: gleaning (30%) and hawking (76%). However, due to the larger size of ground prey, 85% of the nightly food acquisition comes from ground prey despite the lower success rates. The bats predominantly use the same foraging strategy on a given night, suggesting that they adapt their hunting behavior to weather and ground conditions. The results demonstrate that these bats use high risk-high gain gleaning of ground prey as a primary foraging tactic but switch to aerial hunting when environmental changes reduce the profitability of ground prey, highlighting the importance of prey switching in covering energy intake even in specialized predators.
 This study aimed to provide quantitative phylogenetic perspectives on hand preferences in monkeys, apes, and humans by analyzing data from 1786 individuals from 38 species and 22 generas of anthropoid primates. The study used the tube task paradigm to assess hand preferences and classified subjects into two age categories: adults and subadults. The data showed that humans display unparalleled right-handedness among primates, but this difference is in direction and not strength. The human condition is characterized by strong individual hand preferences, which is not the case for other primates. The study found that hand preference strength is generally weaker in juveniles compared to adults and that subadult non-human hominoids are notably stronger left-handed than adults. However, none of the hypotheses on primate handedness, including the postural origins hypothesis (POH), tool use, and brain size hypotheses, were unambiguously corroborated by the data. The study suggests that future research should focus more on manual lateralization strength rather than direction to address the phylogenetic patterns described herein. The data were analyzed using R and the phytools package, and the results showed that lateralization strength has a strong phylogenetic signal among anthropoids, while lateralization direction is more uniform across the anthropoid radiation. The study also found that human right-handedness is unparalleled among primates, but humans only deviate markedly from all other taxa in direction and not in strength of lateralization for bimanual manipulation. The study emphasizes that humans are highly deviant among predominately terrestrial primates in displaying such strong individual hand preferences. The study did not find notable influences of foraging-related tool use or absolute brain size on hand preferences. The study's limitations include the binary coding of ecology, the lack of functional equivalence between different bimanual testing schemes, and the limitations of the phylogenetic modelling approach. The study concludes that the evolutionary underpinnings of handedness expression in humans remain enigmatic.
 Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, hypersocial phenotype, and cardiovascular abnormalities. There are currently no pharmacological treatments for the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a role in cognitive and cardiovascular function, is a potential therapeutic target for this syndrome.In this study, researchers analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation on key phenotypes relevant to WBS. CD mice displayed a hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids.Subchronic (10 days) treatment with JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Notably, JZL184 treatment also improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results suggest that modulation of the ECS is a promising novel therapeutic approach for improving key phenotypic alterations in WBS.
 Animal development involves a series of morphologically and molecularly distinct stages, from embryogenesis to adulthood. In holometabolous insects like Drosophila melanogaster, this process includes larva, pupa, and adult stages. The larval stage is characterized by growth and moulting, while the pupal stage is marked by the elimination of larval tissues and the formation of adult structures. The sequential expression of transcription factors, including chinmo, Br-C, and E93, plays a crucial role in determining the identity of these developmental stages.Chinmo is a transcription factor that promotes growth in larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. Its absence during metamorphosis is critical for proper adult differentiation. Interestingly, Br-C and E93 act as tumour suppressors, while chinmo is known to be a pro-oncogene. The function of chinmo as a juvenile specifier is conserved in hemimetabolous insects like Blattella germanica.Chinmo is expressed during embryogenesis and early larval development and is strongly downregulated from L3. Depletion of chinmo using an RNAi transgene results in developmental arrest at the end of the first instar larval stage, with a tanned cuticle and precocious pupal cuticle gene expression. In the salivary glands, depletion of chinmo causes a dramatic decrease in normal larval development, while in the tracheal system, it results in a reduction in nuclear size and DNA content of tracheal cells and a reduced length of the organ. In contrast, depletion of chinmo in imaginal tissues, such as the wing imaginal discs and eye imaginal discs, strongly impedes their larval development.The regulatory interactions of Chinmo with the other temporal specifiers, Br-C and E93, were examined by measuring their expression in chinmo-depleted salivary glands and wing discs. Contrary to previous reports, both tissues showed a significant and premature increase of Br-C protein levels as early as in L1 larvae, while no increase in E93 protein levels was detected in any tissue. Precocious upregulation of Br-C blocked development in both tissues, phenocopying the loss of function of chinmo. Depletion of chinmo and Br-C in salivary glands and wing discs revealed that while salivary glands showed the same growth impairment observed upon chinmo depletion, depletion of Br-C largely rescued the abnormalities in the wing discs caused by depletion of chinmo.In summary, Chinmo is required during the larval period to control the development and function of larval and imaginal tissues. Its absence by the end of larval development is required for the transition to the prepupa and then to allow terminal adult differentiation during the pupal period. The results suggest that a major regulatory function of chinmo during early larval development in imaginal cells is channelled through the repression of Br-C, while in larval tissues, chinmo appears to exert an active role promoting growth and maturation. The functional and expression data reported above show that Chinmo acts as a larval specifier in Drosophila.
 Cycling of co-substrates, where a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions, is a ubiquitous feature in metabolism. While well-known energy and electron carriers like ATP and NAD(P)H act as cycled co-substrates, there are also other metabolites that perform this role in various parts of central metabolism. In this study, a mathematical framework is developed to analyze the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux.Using a single reaction and linear pathways as examples, it is found that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct from the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalyzing that reaction. This limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. By regulating these two parameters, flux dynamics can be controlled in branched and coupled pathways.Existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from central carbon metabolism were analyzed, revealing several reactions that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. The limitations imposed by co-substrate cycling provide experimentally testable hypotheses on specific metabolic phenotypes.In conclusion, measuring and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells. Co-substrate cycling, in general, and co-substrate cycling specifically, could provide a key design feature in cell metabolism, imposing certain constraints or dynamical properties.
 The study identified NFATc1 as a crucial regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation during development, as NFATc1-expressing cells generated almost all articular chondrocytes but not chondrocytes in the growth-plate primordium. NFATc1-expressing cells displayed prominent capacities for colony formation and multipotent differentiation, and transcriptome analyses revealed a set of characteristic genes in NFATc1-enriched articular cartilage progenitors. The expression of NFATc1 was diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppressing NFATc1 expression in articular cartilage progenitors was sufficient to induce spontaneous chondrogenesis while overexpressing NFATc1 suppresses chondrogenesis. Mechanistically, NFATc1 negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene, indicating that NFATc1 characterizes articular, but not growth-plate, cartilage progenitors and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation at least partly through regulating COL2A1 gene transcription. However, there are some limitations to the study, including the need for further exploration of the detailed molecular mechanism of NFATc1 regulating articular chondrocyte differentiation and the origin of NFATc1+ articular cartilage progenitors.
 Photosystem II (PSII) is a key enzyme in oxygenic photosynthesis, responsible for water oxidation and plastoquinone reduction. The near-universal type of PSII contains 35 chlorophylls a (Chl-a) and 2 pheophytins a (Phe), with Chl-d and Chl-f being found in some cyanobacterial PSII variants. Chl-d and Chl-f replace some of the Chl-a in the reaction centre, allowing for the use of lower energy, far-red light. However, it was predicted that these far-red PSII variants would lose photochemical efficiency and/or resilience to photodamage due to the diminished energy available.In this study, the enzyme turnover efficiency, forward reactions, and back-reactions were compared in Chl-a-PSII, Chl-d-PSII from Acaryochloris marina, and Chl-f-PSII from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis. The results showed that:1. All types of PSII have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover.2. The modified energy gaps on the acceptor side of Chl-d-PSII favour recombination via PD1+Phe- repopulation, leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII.3. The acceptor-side energy gaps in Chl-f-PSII are tuned to avoid harmful back reactions, favouring resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage.The differences in the redox tuning of the electron transfer cofactors Phe and QA and in the number and layout of the chlorophylls that share the excitation energy with the primary electron donor explain the distinct adaptations of Chl-d-PSII and Chl-f-PSII to lower energy environments, each with different functional penalties.
 This study investigated the role of osteocytes in regulating bone and bone marrow homeostasis by examining the effects of osteocyte ablation on bone tissue development and postnatal maturation. The researchers used a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes by expressing diphtheria toxin subunit α in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)-positive osteocytes. The results showed that partial ablation of osteocytes caused impairment of osteogenesis and lymphopoiesis, and increased osteoclastogenesis and mobilization of myelopoiesis toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes. These changes resulted in severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan.Further analysis revealed that osteocytes regulate bone and bone marrow lineage cell specification through the acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells. The researchers suggest that this may be an underlying cause of the accelerated skeletal aging phenotype. The study also showed that sarcopenia usually occurs concurrently with osteoporosis during aging, and that osteocyte ablation caused severe sarcopenia and muscle atrophy.The researchers also found that osteocytes regulate myelopoiesis via Gsα-dependent and -independent signaling and secrete factors such as sclerostin and RANKL to regulate bone metabolism. However, the results demonstrated that osteocyte ablation impaired osteogenesis and induced osteoclastogenesis, despite a reduction in sclerostin expression and an increase in serum RANKL.The study also showed that senescence in osteoprogenitors and myeloid lineage cells led to the impaired osteogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis, respectively. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that senescent osteoprogenitors have reduced self-renewal capacity and predominantly differentiate into adipocytes as opposed to osteoblasts, and that fat-induction factors inhibit osteogenesis during adipogenesis.The researchers also found that even under in vitro conditions, impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogenesis were still observed in osteoprogenitors and bone marrow-derived macrophisms, suggesting that these cells have been primed by the altered bone microenvironment in DTAhet mice before in vitro differentiation.In conclusion, this study demonstrated that osteocytes play a critical role in regulating senescence of bone and bone marrow, and that osteocyte ablation induced SASP accumulation in bone marrow osteoprogenitors and myeloid lineage cells, which altered MSC and HSC lineage commitments with impaired osteogenesis and promoted myelopoiesis and osteoclastogenesis, leading to the accelerated skeletal aging phenotype with severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, degenerative kyphosis, and bone marrow myelopoiesis, thus shortened lifespan. Targeting osteocyte function and cell fate may shed light on the therapeutic regimens for aging-associated bone diseases.
 The long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) of Escherichia coli provides a model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations despite the redundancy of genomic changes leading to similar phenotypic and fitness effects. Researchers characterized the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes in 12 replicate populations after 50,000 generations. They found that all evolved lines have more mRNAs, and this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. Despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations have remarkably similar gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The majority of expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level, with very few translational changes. Mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.
 This study investigates the role of CD133, a marker widely associated with cancer stem cells and drug resistance, during mouse liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy (PHx). In Shp2-deficient livers, actively dividing hepatocytes formed distinctive clusters and highly expressed CD133 but were negative for other stem/progenitor cell markers. CD133 expression was upregulated by proliferative signal inhibition in various cancer cell lines, and isolated CD133+ intracellular vesicles were enriched with mRNAs rather than miRNAs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed lower intracellular transcriptional diversity in Shp2-deficient cells, which was potentially remedied in CD133+ cells through intercellular mRNA exchanges. CD133-deficient cells were more sensitive to proliferative signal inhibition in livers and intestinal organoids. These findings suggest a mechanism of intercellular communication to compensate for intracellular signal deficit in various cell types.
 This study aimed to identify drug candidates for maintaining photoreceptor survival in retinal ciliopathies, specifically LCA10, using an organoid-based high-throughput screening platform. The study used rd16 mouse iPSC-derived retinal organoids, which showed compromised photoreceptor development and viability, as a primary screen. An FDA-approved small molecule drug, reserpine, was identified as an efficacious lead compound that also enhanced photoreceptor development and survival in LCA10 patient iPSC-derived retinal organoids and in the rd16 retina in vivo.Transcriptomic analyses of drug-treated patient organoids indicated modulation of cell survival pathways including p53 and proteostasis by reserpine. Further examination revealed dysregulation of autophagy in patient organoids and rd16 retina, and partial restoration of proteostasis and improved ciliogenesis after reserpine treatment. The study establishes a cross-species drug discovery pipeline using organoid-based HTS and identifies a repurposing drug candidate for maintaining photoreceptor survival in LCA10 patients. Additionally, reserpine and its derivatives could potentially serve as effective treatments for other retinal ciliopathies due to the common impact of proteostasis dysregulation on these diseases.
 In this study, the researchers investigated the role of honey bees and their microbiota in the metabolism of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in almond trees and other plants. They found that both the host and the microbiota contribute to the degradation of amygdalin.The researchers first confirmed that amygdalin can be metabolized by both bees and members of their gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In contrast, in microbiota-colonized bees, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut.The researchers also identified specific strains of Bifidobacterium, Bombilactobacillus, and Gilliamella that can degrade amygdalin. They found that the degradation mechanism varies between strains, with some producing prunasin as an intermediate and others not.Furthermore, they identified a highly expressed enzyme belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3) in amygdalin-grown cultures of Bifidobacterium strain wkB204. This enzyme is likely involved in the degradation of amygdalin and prunasin.The researchers also investigated the impact of amygdalin on honey bee health and found that concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mM did not affect bee survival rates or microbiota composition and did not deter bees. However, dietary amygdalin can reduce parasite and viral loads in honey bees.Overall, this study sheds light on the complex interactions between honey bees, their microbiota, and the plant compounds they encounter in their diet. It highlights the importance of considering both the host and the microbiota when studying the metabolism and health effects of dietary compounds in insects.
 Candida albicans causes severe invasive candidiasis, which requires the virulence factor candidalysin (CL) for membrane damage. CL uses a unique mechanism to form membrane pores by pre-assembling into a pore-competent loop conformation in solution. The assembly of CL into an insertion-competent state in solution may provide an infectivity advantage for C. albicans, and could also be a potential therapeutic opportunity to inhibit CL pore formation. The oligomeric state of the basic assembly unit is proposed to be a CL 8-mer, and future studies are expected to shed light on the specific reasons behind the disparate effects of mutations and determine if CL pore formation is indeed under kinetic control. Wild-type and variant CL were synthesized and characterized using mass spectrometry, ion mobility measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed to determine the molecular weight and size of CL in solution. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of CL in the presence and absence of lipid bilayers. AFM imaging was performed to observe CL pores in lipid bilayers and to investigate the effect of mutations on CL pore formation. The data suggest that CL forms membrane pores by pre-assembling into a pore-competent loop conformation in solution, and that this mechanism may be a potential therapeutic target to inhibit CL pore formation.
 Precision medicine, which tailors interventions to patients' genetic, biological, and behavioral markers, holds promise for improved health outcomes. However, the effectiveness of personalized interventions may not solely be due to their pharmacological ingredients; contextual factors, such as the therapeutic interaction and placebo effects, may also contribute significantly. This study aimed to test whether framing a sham treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness by recruiting 102 adults to receive painful heat stimulations on their forearm. Participants were told either that the machine was personalized to their genetics and physiology or that it was effective in reducing pain generally. The results showed that participants in the personalized group reported greater relief in pain intensity and unpleasantness than the control group in both the feasibility study and the pre-registered double-blind confirmatory study. Several personality traits moderated the results. These findings provide evidence that framing a placebo treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness and could potentially improve the methodology of precision medicine research and inform practice. The study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council and Genome Québec.Contextual factors, such as the therapeutic interaction and placebo effects, may significantly influence the effectiveness of personalized interventions in precision medicine. While the role of contextual factors in precision medicine remains unexplored, research in placebo science suggests that contextual factors, such as verbal suggestions, patient expectations, social cues, and observational learning, can increase the effectiveness of inactive treatments and placebo effects of real treatments for both subjective and physiological symptoms. The public's high expectations, increased trust, and preference for uniqueness in precision medicine may also contribute to placebo effects. Providing genetic and physiological feedback and using it to tailor treatments may similarly influence outcomes for precision therapies. The appeal to individuality and the personalization process may also implicitly suggest stronger perceived treatment effectiveness by harnessing factors known to increase the placebo effect. However, the influence of the personalization process on perceived treatment effectiveness is largely unknown. Therefore, this study tested whether believing that a treatment is tailored to one's physiology and genetics may improve its perceived efficacy. The study found that participants using the machine presented as personalized reported nearly twice the reduction in pain intensity and unpleasantness as those in the control group. These findings could potentially optimize contextual factors in precision medicine and inform clinical practice.In conclusion, this study provides evidence that framing a placebo treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness and could potentially optimize contextual factors in precision medicine. The findings could have implications beyond the field of precision medicine and healthcare, as individual tailoring is increasingly becoming the focus of consumer products and experiences. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms of action and optimize contextual factors in the delivery of personalized treatments.
 Shared lineage has diverse effects on neuronal circuitry in various model systems. In the zebrafish spinal cord, sister V2a (NotchOFF) and V2b (NotchON) neurons arise from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and have somata in close proximity and similar axonal trajectories. However, electrophysiological analyses reveal that these sister neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. This divergent connectivity resembles the Notch-differentiated sister neurons in Drosophila and represents the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.In both zebrafish and mice, vsx1+ progenitors give rise to two distinct daughter populations, V2a and V2b neurons. Using a stochastic labeling approach, we successfully labeled clonally related V2 neurons in zebrafish spinal cord but required a chx10 co-label to properly identify vsx1 pairs as V2a/b neurons in vivo. Sister V2a/b neurons are located in close proximity to each other during larval stages, but their axons exhibit different morphological characteristics. Sister V2a neurons have axons that are on average 61% longer than their V2b counterparts due to Notch expression attenuating axon growth. However, there is no relationship between axon length and location along the rostral-caudal axis.To assess axon proximity, we calculated the shortest distance between the V2b and V2a axon along each point of the V2b neuron. Clonally related V2a/b neurons send axons along a similar trajectory, with a median of 37.1% of the V2b axon length within 5 µm of the V2a axon. This suggests a possibility for sister V2a/b neurons to contact shared synaptic targets. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology in voltage clamp from clonally related pairs of V2a/b neurons revealed little to no synchronous synaptic input. Non-sister V2a/b neurons from the same segment also receive input from distinct synaptic sources.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that sister V2a/b neurons develop and remain close to each other during larval stages but do not form synaptic connections with each other or with shared downstream targets. This suggests that developmental timing and divergent cellular identities may determine neuronal connectivity in the spinal cord. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the integration of Notch-differentiated sister neurons into distinct circuits.
 The study investigates the role of the PARbZIP family of transcription factors in regulating homeostatic plasticity, a mechanism that enables neuronal networks to rebalance activity following perturbations. The PARbZIP family consists of HLF, TEF, DBP, and E4BP4, all of which share the same DNA binding motif. While these factors are typically thought to act as transcriptional activators, they do not oscillate in the brain outside of the SCN and have been linked to epilepsy. The study found that prolonged activity deprivation activates a robust transcriptional program involving the PARbZIP TFs HLF and TEF, which act to restrain the expression of homeostatic plasticity. The results suggest that homeostatic plasticity is itself subject to activity-dependent regulation and is transcriptionally restrained by the PARbZIP TFs HLF and TEF. The study also found that HLF and TEF are upregulated soon after activity withdrawal and continue to increase with time, suggesting that their upregulation correlates with the length of the network's silencing. Loss of function of members of the PARbZIP family is also associated with epileptic phenotypes, but it is proposed that instead of driving homeostatic plasticity, HLF and TEF are upregulated in the TTX condition to restrain homeostatic responses. The study further found that HLF and TEF regulate recurrent excitatory synaptic connections and inhibition, although the inhibition is less affected. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of homeostatic plasticity and the role of transcriptional regulation in neuronal networks.
 The developing respiratory buds of the mammalian lung are marked by the presence of important progenitor cells, identified by the expression of SOX9 and ID2. Early in embryonic development, prior to E13.5, SOX9+progenitors are multipotent and generate both airway and alveolar epithelium. However, they become selective progenitors of alveolar epithelial cells later in development. Transcription factors, including Sox9, Etv5, Irx, Mycn, and Foxp1/2, interact in complex gene regulatory networks to control proliferation and differentiation of SOX9+progenitors. The molecular mechanisms by which these transcription factors and other signaling pathways control chromatin state to establish and maintain cell-type identity are not well-defined.To gain insight into the chromatin accessibility landscape of developing SOX9+lung epithelial progenitor cells, paired RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq were performed on SOX9+epithelial cells isolated from a transgenic reporter mouse at E11.5 and E16.5. Widespread changes in chromatin accessibility were observed between these timepoints, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements. Gene regulatory network inference identified a common SOX9+progenitor gene regulatory network, implicating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+progenitor cells. Consistent with this model, conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mouse resulted in an expansion of the SOX9+EPC population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation.These data demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis and emphasize the combinatorial power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development. However, further studies are needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which PI3K signaling regulates chromatin state and cellular differentiation during lung development. Additionally, the role of other signaling pathways and transcription factors in integrating developmental and external stimuli into comprehensive cellular programs that enable regulatory proteins access to activate or repress gene expression remains an area of active investigation.
 Working memory (WM) is a crucial cognitive domain affected in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), primarily studied using the binary slot model. However, recent observations from continuous reproduction paradigms suggest the dynamic allocation of WM resources (resource model) for more accurate predictions. This study employed two continuous reproduction paradigms, memory-guided localization (MGL) and analog recall tasks with sequential presentation, to investigate WM dysfunction in MS.The results demonstrated an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS. While sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy control from relapsing-remitting MS, MGL were more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes. Computational modeling revealed that imprecision in decoding information and swap error were responsible for WM dysfunction in MS.The study provided a sensitive measure for assessing WM impairment and offered new insights into the organization of WM dysfunction in MS. However, it had limitations, including the lack of structural and functional evaluations and the absence of an eye tracker. Future studies should address these limitations to validate the findings and better understand the underlying mechanisms of WM deficits in MS.The study involved 121 MS patients (61 relapsing-remitting and 60 secondary progressive) and 73 healthy controls. Participants underwent a clinical interview, neurological examination, Nine-Hole Peg Test, and the Persian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Visual WM was assessed using two analog recall tasks, MGL and analog recall paradigms with sequential bar presentation. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac, and the level of significance was set at p-value<0.05.
 Nociception, the neural process that animals use to detect and encode potentially tissue-damaging stimuli, is crucial for survival. While the peripheral mechanisms of nociception are conserved across the animal kingdom, the brain-mediated modulation is less understood, particularly in non-mammalian species. In this study, researchers investigated the role of Drosophila in nociceptive regulation through its descending inhibitory mechanism from the brain, mediated by the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) that plays an important role in mammalian descending control of nociception.Using a combination of genetic, behavioral, histological, and Ca2+ imaging analyses, the researchers found that DSK mutants were hypersensitive to noxious heat, and that DSK signaling was mediated through its receptors, CCKLR-17D1 and CCKLR-17D3. They also identified neurons involved in DSK-mediated nociceptive regulation at a single-cell resolution and revealed a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception.These findings provide the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species, suggesting that the descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception. The study also highlights the importance of using non-mammalian model systems to investigate central pain pathophysiology and descending nociceptive control mechanisms, which may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying central pain modulation and pain pathology due to dysfunctions of descending modulatory pathways.
 This study investigates a fungus, Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1, that infects Aglaia odorata plants despite the presence of antifungal rocaglates produced by the host. The researchers found that Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1 possesses an amino acid substitution in eIF4A, a molecular target of rocaglates, which confers resistance to the compound. The genetically engineered Colletotrichum orbiculare, a cucumber-infecting fungus, with the same substitution showed insensitivity to the translational repression induced by rocaglates, enabling it to infect plants even in their presence. The findings demonstrate a unique contest between plants and fungi centered on secondary metabolites synthesized in the host plant.Plants often produce secondary metabolites, such as rocaglates, as defense mechanisms against parasites. However, some fungi can overcome the barrier presented by these compounds through various mechanisms. In this study, researchers found an Aglaia plant-parasitizing fungus that overcomes the toxicity of rocaglates through an amino acid substitution in eIF4A. The fungus was identified as belonging to the Ophiocordyceps genus and was distinct from other known species based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis. The genetically engineered C. orbiculare, a cucumber-infecting fungus, with the same substitution showed insensitivity to the translational repression induced by rocaglates, demonstrating the fungus's resistance to the compound.Rocaglates are small molecules synthesized in plants of the genus Aglaia and have antifungal properties, making them of particular interest due to their antitumor activities. They target eIF4A, a DEAD-box RNA binding protein, and function as potent translation inhibitors with a unique mechanism. The artificial anchoring of eIF4A becomes a steric hindrance to scanning 40S ribosomes, masks the cap structure of mRNA, and reduces the available pool of eIF4A for active translation initiation events by the sequestration of eIF4A on mRNAs. Since eIF4A is an essential gene for all eukaryotes, Aglaia plants must have a mechanism to evade the cytotoxicity of the rocaglates they produce. This self-resistance is achieved by the unique amino acid substitutions at the sites in eIF4A proteins where rocaglates directly associate.The researchers identified a fungus growing on the surface of the stem of the Aglaia odorata plant with tremendous vitality. The fungus was isolated, and its RNA was sequenced, revealing that it belonged to the Ophiocordyceps genus and was distinct from other known species based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis. The fungus possessed an amino acid substitution in eIF4A at the critical interface for rocaglate interaction, conferring resistance to the compound. The genetically engineered C. orbiculare, a cucumber-infecting fungus, with the same substitution showed insensitivity to the translational repression induced by rocaglates, demonstrating the fungus's resistance to the compound.In conclusion, this study highlights a unique contest between plants and fungi centered on secondary metabolites synthesized in the host plant. The findings demonstrate that Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1, a parasitic fungus on Aglaia plants, overcomes the toxicity of rocaglates through an amino acid substitution in eIF4A, conferring resistance to the compound. The genetically engineered C. orbiculare, a cucumber-infecting fungus, with the same substitution shows insensitivity to the translational repression induced by rocaglates, enabling it to infect plants even in their presence. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-fungus interactions and the evolution of resistance to secondary metabolites.
 Psychophysical methods, including forced-choice tasks, are widely used in psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral economics to quantify the relationship between external stimuli and internal sensations. These methods involve controlled experiments and rigorous analysis using signal detection theory (SDT), which assumes a sensory signal generates an internal representation corrupted by Gaussian variability and leads to a binary decision based on a comparison of this stochastic signal with an internal criterion. However, these methods require many trials and preferably highly trained participants, leading to tedious data collection and potential limitations in studying untrained subjects or children.Recently, continuous psychophysics has emerged as an alternative approach, abandoning the rigid trial structure in favor of continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli. This method requires fewer trials and is more natural for untrained subjects, making it suitable for various applications, such as measuring contrast sensitivity, eye movements, or retinal sensitivity. However, current analysis methods for continuous psychophysics do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task, leading to larger perceptual thresholds compared to traditional psychophysical experiments.To address this challenge, a new computational analysis framework based on Bayesian inverse optimal control (BIOC) has been proposed. This framework not only recovers perceptual thresholds but also estimates subjects' action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. By modeling the behavior of subjects as optimal control under uncertainty, the BIOC method probabilistically inverts the model to infer the underlying parameters, providing further evidence for the importance of considering acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and intrinsic costs in experiments, even when the focus seems to be only on perception.The BIOC method has been validated through simulations and previously published data, demonstrating its feasibility for actions involving human and nonhuman primate participants, such as tracking with a computer mouse, finger, or gaze. The results show that the method recovers perceptual uncertainties closer to those obtained with classical paradigms than previous analysis methods, while also extracting meaningful psychological quantities capturing behavioral variability, effort costs, and subjective perceptual beliefs.In summary, the BIOC method for continuous psychophysics offers a powerful and flexible framework for analyzing behavioral data, allowing for the modeling and inferring of additional cognitive factors that influence perception. This approach opens up the prospect of a wider adoption of continuous psychophysics paradigms in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience, while also providing further evidence for the importance of considering the behavioral goal and subjective costs in experiments.
 This study explores how normative decision rules, specifically decision thresholds, adapt to reward and evidence-quality switches in dynamic environments. The authors used dynamic programming to derive optimal threshold policies for a general incremental cost function and applied it to constant cost functions. They found that the optimal decision thresholds can be mapped to LLR-space to obtain adaptive thresholds. The authors also addressed the challenges of optimizing both the numerator and denominator of the reward rate equation for variable trial lengths by adopting techniques from average reward reinforcement learning. The study's findings demonstrate that ideal observers and human subjects use adaptive and robust normative decision strategies in relatively simple decision environments. The results can aid experimentalists in understanding the possible behaviors to expect in subject data, identifying adaptive decision rules, and identifying the relationship between task dynamics and decision rules. The study also highlights the importance of considering the sensitivity of performance to both model choice and task parameters.
 This study applies a conceptual framework using artificial intelligence to examine the links between biodiversity dynamics and abiotic change in a freshwater ecosystem, specifically Lake Ring in Denmark, over the past century. The framework identifies correlations between community-level functional biodiversity, biocides, and climate change records. The results show that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed significantly over time without returning to its original state, even after partial recovery from eutrophication and land use in recent times. Insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. The community-level biodiversity approach used here reliably explained freshwater ecosystem shifts, unlike traditional quality indices. The study advocates the use of high-throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends to identify the environmental factors causing loss of biodiversity and disrupting ecosystem functions.
 In the present study, researchers evaluated the proposition that the brain compensates for fundamental delays in motion perception by predictively encoding the position of moving objects using information from their past trajectories. Using multivariate analysis of high temporal resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) data, they found that early position representations of moving objects were activated substantially earlier than equivalent activity evoked by unpredictable flashes, aligning the earliest representations of moving stimuli with their real-time positions. However, delays still accumulated across later stages of cortical processing. The findings suggest that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for neural delays accumulated early in stimulus processing, but that subsequent cortical visual areas do not implement further compensation for neural delays. The existence of these extrapolation mechanisms opens the possibility that transmission delays on the way to visual cortex might be partially or fully compensated, allowing the early visual system to represent moving objects on predictable trajectories closer to their real-time locations. However, it is unclear whether similar mechanisms operate along the cortical visual processing hierarchy to compensate for additional delays that accumulate as visual information is processed. The study provides the first direct evidence in humans that extrapolation processes allow the early visual system to localise moving objects in real time.
 This study investigated how early language experience modulates the neural representation of semantic knowledge in the human brain using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and a unique human model of early deaf adults with varying amounts and qualities of language exposure. The results showed that early deaf adults with reduced early language exposure had reduced semantic sensitivity in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL) compared to early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth. This finding provides positive, causal evidence that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the dATL, highlighting the role of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences. The study also discussed the implications of these findings for neurodevelopment more generally and the possibility that language-derived knowledge neural systems may lay the foundation for the efficient storage and manipulation of semantic knowledge, particularly abstract knowledge without tangible and consistent sensorimotor referents.
 Replay, the sequential reactivation of neural ensembles in the hippocampus, is a crucial mechanism for memory processing. While place cells' activity is used to encode behavioral episodes through both rate and place representations, replay has primarily been defined based on place information. In this study, researchers investigated the role of rate information during replay in rats running along two novel linear tracks. They observed that place cells in dorsal CA1 could modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts, independent of place information. This rate modulation mirrors the same pattern observed during behavior and can be used to discriminate between contexts. The findings suggest that hippocampal memory processes rely on two complementary neural representations: place and rate.The researchers recorded extracellularly from dorsal CA1 in five male Lister-hooded rats, which were trained to run back and forth along two linear tracks to collect a liquid reward at each end. They observed global remapping of place cells between the two tracks, with the majority of place fields shifting their location and/or modulating their firing rate. They used Bayesian decoding to detect replay sequences of each linear track and identified statistically significant replay trajectories.To investigate the role of rate information during replay, they compared the place fields' peak in-field firing rate differences between tracks to the difference in average peak instantaneous rates during significant replay events. They found that the difference in peak in-field firing rate between tracks was predictive of the difference in average peak instantaneous rates during replay events from both tracks during the post-exploration period (POST). However, this was not the case during the pre-exploration period (PRE).The researchers also tested their findings using alternative metrics for replay firing rate and place fields firing rate, as well as different criteria for significant replay events and place cells. They found that their results were consistent across these variations. Overall, their findings suggest that contextually driven rate modulation between two behavioral episodes is maintained during offline replay.
 This study investigates the role of PARL, a mitochondrial intra-membrane rhomboid protease, in male infertility caused by impaired spermatogenesis. PARL is linked to mitochondrial encephalopathies, including Leigh syndrome, and is essential for maintaining mitochondrial fitness. In PARL-deficient mice, early testicular atrophy and a complete arrest of spermatogenesis during meiotic prophase I occur, independent of neurodegeneration. The spermatocytes exhibit severe mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities, including defects in the electron transfer chain, disrupted coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, and metabolic rewiring. These defects lead to arrested spermatocytes undergoing ferroptosis, a regulated cell death modality characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. The findings suggest that mitochondrial defects induced by PARL depletion act as an initiating trigger for ferroptosis in primary spermatocytes through simultaneous effects on GPX4 and CoQ, two major inhibitors of ferroptosis. The study sheds new light on the potential role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and male infertility, warranting further investigation.
 In this study, the researchers aimed to uncover the mechanisms behind the protective effects of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) using APOE*3-Leiden . CETP mice, a well-established model for human-like metabolic diseases. FGF21 was overexpressed in the liver through an adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) vector, followed by administration of a high-fat high-cholesterol diet for 23 weeks. The results showed that FGF21 prevented hepatic lipotoxicity, accompanied by activation of thermogenic tissues and attenuation of adipose tissue inflammation. It also improved hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia and upregulated hepatic programs involved in fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol removal. Furthermore, FGF21 inhibited hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduced Kupffer cell (KC) activation, diminished monocyte infiltration, and lower accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Additionally, FGF21 decreased lipid- and scar-associated macrophages, which correlated with less hepatic fibrosis as demonstrated by reduced collagen accumulation. Collectively, hepatic FGF21 overexpression limits hepatic lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrogenesis by blocking hepatic lipid influx and accumulation through combined endocrine and autocrine signaling, respectively, and preventing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic macrophages in the liver.
 The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data language is an open-source, standardized approach for describing neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB addresses the challenges of heterogeneity and evolution in neurophysiology experiments by providing a unified framework through its novel data language, which can co-evolve with the needs of the neuroscience community. NWB enables precise communication about neural data, supports reproducibility, interchange, and reuse of diverse neurophysiology data, and is foundational for the Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI) data repository. NWB's design principles include a specification language, a data standard schema, APIs, and storage backends, all of which are factored out as the Hierarchical Data Modeling Framework (HDMF) to make NWB accessible to users and developers. NWB's ecosystem includes tools for data acquisition, processing, analysis, and publication, and supports experiment planning, data acquisition, processing, and analysis to publication and reuse. NWB is a critical component of the neurophysiology data ecosystem, as it allows scientists to identify unmet needs and contribute new tools to address them, ensuring that neurophysiology data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).
 Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes respiratory tract disease and seasonal epidemics, with H1N1 strains identified as the causal agent for pandemics in 1918 and 2009. Beyond respiratory disease, IAV infections have been linked to neurological consequences such as encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. The mechanisms behind these neurological disturbances are not well understood, but it is believed that even non-neurotropic strains can infiltrate the brain and cause neurological damage.A recent study used intranasal infections with H1N1 pdm09 in female mice and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to follow changes in the transcriptional landscape of cell populations in the medial hypothalamus. The study found changes in all populations during the peak of disease, with a change in cell state in microglia at early infection and later strong effects in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, after the mice have recovered from the acute infection, all non-neuronal cell types return to their resting state, while neurons show long-lasting changes of the transcriptome even after full recovery.The study also found that viral infection of the olfactory bulb using H1N1 pdm09 is comparable to previous studies using the non-neurotropic H1N1 strain PR8. However, the study did not find neuroinflammatory processes in the hypothalamus, or if the here-chosen time point of 3 dpi might be too late to capture innate immune activation in the CNS. The study identified a lack of RNA sequencing studies focusing solely on molecular changes in the hypothalamus during non-neurotropic IAV challenges and suggested that different molecular changes based on viral strain or between brain regions are expected and further studies are needed to resolve this.The study also found that many of the neuronal subpopulations respond with a similar pattern when the organism is challenged by an infection, with changes including inhibition of genes contributing to metabolic and translational processes in the neurons. While most neuronal subpopulations follow this same regulatory pattern, POMC+ neurons show bigger and more unique changes in gene regulation following a peripheral influenza infection. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, can have different immunological functions and properties based on their activation state. The study found that microglia are also in the medial hypothalamus a main immune orchestrating cell population, shifting from their homeostatic state towards a pro-inflammatory microglia population during 3 and 7 dpi. This shift is completely resolved after recovery at 23 dpi.The study also found that oligodendrocytes and astrocytes between 144-244 genes were up- or down-regulated at 3 and/or 7 dpi, accompanied by a shift of the cells in the dimensional reduction plot of the not integrated data, especially at 7 dpi. In oligodendrocytes, this was accompanied by an up-regulation of genes involved in stress-related and glucocorticoid pathways. The same was not seen in the astrocyte sub-cluster. The study identified significantly regulated GO terms associated with transport pathways in oligodendrocytes, with a strong up-regulation of genes in these terms at 3 and 7 dpi. Only mitochondrial transport processes and transmembrane transport included down-regulated genes. Genes associated with GABAergic transport was up-regulated in oligodendrocytes uniquely at 7 dpi. Marker genes for the astrocytic 7-dpi cluster were identified as Aldh1a1, Lrrc8a, and Zfhx3. Zfhx3 showed a very distinct expression in this cluster. For astrocytes, the GO term oxidoreductase activity was highly and uniquely enriched at 7 dpi. Accordingly, the oxidoreductase genes were found to be highly up-regulated in the 7-dpi cluster, with only a few being also regulated at 3 dpi and non at 23 dpi.Taken together, the data suggest that an IAV infection induces slowly evolving transcriptional changes in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, leading to the appearance of distinct sub-populations of these cell types at 
 In the study, researchers investigated the mechanisms and mediators of plasticity upon apicobasal polarity loss in epithelial cells, which is a key event in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis. They used Drosophila ovaries as a model system, where inducing polarity-gene l(2)gl (Lgl) knockdown causes invasive multilayering of the follicular epithelium.Through single-cell RNA sequencing, they discovered distinct phenotypes and characterized the underlying gene expression. They identified a genetic requirement of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in promoting multilayer formation of Lgl-KD cells. Ectopic expression of Keap1 increased the volume of delaminated follicle cells and enhanced their invasive behavior, with significant changes to the cytoskeleton.The findings describe the comprehensive transcriptome of cells within the follicle cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and identify a previously unappreciated link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis. The study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the earliest stages of tumorigenesis following polarity loss.
 This study investigated the behavioural and neural computations that differentiate learning from social and non-social information sources. Participants took part in a tightly controlled within-subject design, where they made trial-wise confidence judgements about the advice of social and non-social information sources. The results showed that participants used different strategies when setting intervals to express their confidence in the performances of social advisors as opposed to non-social advisors. The study used a computational approach to test the interplay of two belief estimates that impact interval setting: the belief in how accurate the advice/prediction is and the subjective uncertainty in that belief. The study found that participants were less influenced by their subjective uncertainty when estimating the performances of social advisors and changed and updated their beliefs about social cues less than about non-social cues when they observed the outcomes of their predictions. The study also found that participants experience a steeper decline of subjective uncertainty in their beliefs about the accuracy of social advice, resulting in a narrower prior distribution, during the next encounter with the same advisor. The study used Bayesian simulations to investigate how uncertainty about beliefs changed from trial to trial and showed that belief updates about non-social cues were consistent with a noisier update process that diminished the impact of experiences over the longer term. The study suggests that participants attribute intentions and motivations to social agents, leading them to assume stability in the performances of social advisors, but not non-social cues. The study found that the same algorithm was able to explain social and non-social learning, but the extent to which the algorithm was recruited when learning about social compared to non-social information differed. The study used ROIs derived from previous studies to show that dmPFC and pTPJ represent a combination of present and past confidence judgements that are made about social advisors and that they do this more strongly for social than for non-social cues. The study used a Bayesian model to guide the analyses and found that participants’ behaviour and uncertainty estimates were influenced by the social or non-social framing of the task. The study used a general linear model (GLM) analysis to predict participants’ interval setting and found that participants’ subjective uncertainty in their accuracy belief was a significant predictor of their interval setting. The study used a learning index to measure the rate at which evidence observed at the time of the prediction error is integrated into the next estimate and found that participants updated their intervals by less than the prediction error that they observed, indicating under-adjustment of the interval setting. The study also found that participants were more likely to select predictors that were more accurate in their predictions and that participants were able to do this by observing the angular errors associated with their predictions. The study used a Bayesian approach to estimate participants’ beliefs about the performance of a social and non-social advisor/predictor and found that participants’ beliefs were influenced by the social or non-social framing of the task. The study used a GLM to predict changes in interval settings as a function of model-based and model-free regressors and found that participants’ prediction error was a significant predictor of their interval setting change. The study used a Bayesian model to test whether the integration of new evidence differed between social and non-social conditions and found that participants reduced their uncertainty quicker when observing social information and that new information can be flexibly integrated during the belief update. The study used a Bayesian model to simulate trial-wise interval setting for each participant according to the observations they made and found that an increase in noise led to simulation behaviour that resembled behavioural patterns observed in the non-social condition. The study used a Bayesian model to estimate participants’ beliefs about the distribution that determined the observed angular error and found that participants’ beliefs were updated by multiplication of a prior belief and a likelihood distribution, resulting in a posterior belief. The study used a Bayesian model to estimate the posterior pdf across parameter space and normalized it to ensure that probabilities across all sigma values added up to one. The study used a GLM to predict participants’ interval setting and found that participants’ subjective uncertainty in their accuracy belief was a significant predictor of their interval setting. The study used a learning index to measure the rate at which evidence observed at the time of the prediction error is integrated into the next estimate and found that participants updated their intervals by less than the prediction error that they observed, indicating under-adjustment of the interval setting. The study used a Bayesian model to test whether the integration of new evidence differed between social and non-social conditions and found that participants reduced their uncertainty quicker when observing social information and that new information can be flexibly integrated during the belief update. The study used a Bayesian model to simulate trial-wise interval setting for each participant according to the observations they made and found that an increase in noise led to simulation behaviour that resembled behavioural patterns
 The study presented in the text aims to develop a molecular model of neurotransmitter release based on the properties of the synaptic protein synaptotagmin (yt). The model is based on the reaction scheme of a single C2B domain, which can bind PI(4,5)P2 and two Ca2+ ions. The model assumes the simplest case of simultaneous association of both Ca2+ ions to the C2B domain. The model also includes the positive allosteric stabilization of the dual-bound state, which promotes fusion by lowering the energy barrier. The model predicts that each C2B domain engaging in dual Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 binding lowers the energy barrier for fusion by ~5 kBT, and most fusion events occur when three syts actively reduce the energy barrier for fast SV fusion. The model also explores the consequences of putative mutations affecting Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 binding and/or the allosteric coupling between the binding sites of both species. The study concludes that allosterically stabilized Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 dual binding to the C2B domain forms the molecular basis for synaptotagmins to exert their cooperative control of neurotransmitter release.
 Sauropterygia was a diverse clade of Mesozoic marine reptiles spanning the Early Triassic to Late Cretaceous, traditionally divided into two major lineages: the short-necked, durophagous Placodontia and the long-necked Eosauropterygia. However, the early evolutionary history of sauropterygians and their relationships with other diapsid reptiles are still incompletely understood.A new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic of South China, Prosaurosphargis yingzishanensis, represents the earliest known occurrence of the clade. An updated phylogenetic analysis focusing on the interrelationships among diapsid reptiles recovers saurosphargids as nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. Furthermore, a clade comprising Eusaurosphargis and Palatodonta is recovered as the sauropterygian sister-group within Sauropterygomorpha tax. nov.The phylogenetic position of several Early and Middle Triassic sauropterygians, such as Atopodentatus, Hanosaurus, Majiashanosaurus, and Corosaurus, is also clarified, elucidating the early evolutionary assembly of the sauropterygian body plan. The study provides evidence for the rapid diversification of sauropterygians in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event and emphasizes the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa.The new saurosphargid, Prosaurosphargis yingzishanensis, is described as having dorsal transverse processes that are relatively short mediolaterally and broad anteroposteriorly, and rows of rudimentary osteoderms on its body flanks. This indicates that the osteoderms in Pomolispondylus likely represent a late stage of osteoderm reduction in the lineage leading to Eosauropterygia, rather than the first stages of osteoderm development in the saurosphargid lineage.The analysis also recovers a close relationship between Archosauromorpha and Testudines within a monophyletic Archelosauria, which is strongly supported by molecular data but only recently recovered in a phylogenetic analysis using a morphology-only dataset. The study demonstrates the importance of including a broad sample of outgroup taxa in phylogenetic analyses and choosing their stratigraphically oldest and/or anatomically most plesiomorphic representatives as operational taxonomic units to accurately reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships between major extant and extinct reptilian lineages.
 This study aimed to investigate the reactive and reversible effects of smoking on DNA methylation in human blood cells using a large cohort of monozygotic twin pairs. The study identified 13 differentially methylated CpGs in current smoking discordant monozygotic twin pairs, with eight of these sites showing lower methylation in smoking twins compared to their non-smoking co-twins. The methylation differences were smaller in former smoking discordant pairs and current/former smoking discordant pairs compared to current/never smoking discordant pairs. The results suggest that smoking-associated methylation patterns in blood cells are largely reversible upon quitting smoking. The study also found that five additional epigenome-wide significant CpGs were identified in current/former smoking discordant pairs. All 13 differentially methylated CpGs and 10 of the 13 CpGs identified in former smoking discordant pairs have been previously associated with smoking. The study also examined the overlap of methylation differences in smoking discordant twin pairs with loci that have a causal effect on smoking and found that three of the 13 epigenome-wide significant DMPs detected in smoking discordant monozygotic pairs were located within 1 Mb of a GWAS locus associated with smoking initiation. The study concludes that monozygotic twin pairs offer a unique opportunity to assess smoking-reactive methylation patterns and examine the extent to which effects are reversible upon quitting smoking.
 The structure and function of the vertebrate retina have been extensively studied through isolated, ex vivo preparations. However, understanding retinal function in awake animals remains elusive. In this study, single-unit extracellular recordings were performed in the optic tract of head-fixed mice to compare the output of awake, anesthetized, and ex vivo retinas. While visual response properties were overall similar across conditions, awake retinal output had faster kinetics with less variability in response latencies, a larger dynamic range, and higher firing activity. Modeling analyses further showed that awake responses convey comparable total information but less efficiently, allowing for a linear population decoder to perform significantly better than anesthetized or ex vivo responses. These results suggest that the retina employs dense coding in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as previously assumed from ex vivo studies.
 Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde (PFA) is a common method used to preserve biomolecular transactions in living cells for various biological techniques. However, the effect of PFA fixation on liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) behaviors is not well understood. In this study, the authors compared images of U2OS cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins (IDRs) known to undergo LLPS before and after PFA fixation. They found that fixation can both enhance and diminish putative LLPS behaviors, and in some cases, even cause artificial puncta to appear in cells without detectable puncta in the live condition. The authors also established a kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein–protein interactions and demonstrated that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein–protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and notably, the difference between fixation rates of different proteins. The findings reveal that PFA fixation changes the appearance of LLPS from living cells, present a caveat in studying LLPS using fixation-based methods, and suggest a mechanism underlying the fixation artifact.
 The bladder-chip model is a novel in vitro system designed to mimic the bladder architecture by co-culturing human bladder epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells in a device with flow channels for urine and nutritive media, respectively. The model allows for the application of linear strain to mimic bladder filling and voiding cycles, and the use of antibiotics to study bacterial persistence. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) attachment and invasion of bladder epithelial cells is sensitive to fluidic shear stress, and the bladder-chip model enables the study of UPEC infection under low shear stress conditions.Upon infection, neutrophils are recruited to the site of infection and form neutrophil swarms and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to control bacterial growth. However, not all neutrophils are able to control bacterial growth, and some bacteria within IBCs are protected from neutrophil-mediated killing. During the recovery period, a significant fraction of IBCs reseed new foci of infection through bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation. These insights suggest that IBCs play a significant role in bacterial persistence and reseeding of bladder infections, with important consequences for non-compliance with antibiotic regimens. The bladder-chip model offers a valuable tool for studying the complex dynamics of urinary tract infections and the role of IBCs in bacterial persistence and antibiotic resistance.
 This study investigates the flexibility of Escherichia coli's cellular amination network by constructing a glutamate auxotrophic strain and testing its ability to grow on various amino acids. The results reveal that several amino acids complemented the auxotrophy either by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. The study also identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Furthermore, new amino acids were extended to the transaminase network, and d-amino acid dehydrogenase (DadA) was identified as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. The study also introduced ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine. Overall, the findings reveal the high flexibility of the cellular amination network in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.
 This study investigates the response of the coral symbiont alga Breviolum to low pH environments and the mechanism involved in monosaccharide secretion. Breviolum was grown in normal and acidic media, and the results showed that low pH significantly suppressed algal growth, caused cellular changes, and increased monosaccharide secretion. The cell wall structures of Breviolum cells cultured at low pH were more exfoliated, and the cell surface structures were wrinkled. Gene expression analysis revealed that low pH upregulated genes associated with cellulose metabolism, including cellulase and glycoside hydrolase. The cellulase gene was identified as a differentially expressed gene, and its activity was inhibited by the cellulase inhibitor, glucopyranoside, suggesting that cell wall degradation is involved in monosaccharide secretion. Overall, the findings suggest that low pH signals the cellulase-mediated release of monosaccharides from the algal cell wall as an environmental response in coral reef ecosystems.
 Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a recessive renal cystic disease characterized by renal fibrosis and cyst formation, accounting for a significant portion of end-stage renal disease in children and young adults. Currently, no targeted therapy is available for this disease. Among the over 25 NPHP genes identified, INVS/NPHP2 is one of them. In mice, global knockout of Invs leads to renal fibrosis and cysts. However, the precise contribution of different cell types and the relationship between epithelial cysts and interstitial fibrosis remains undefined.To dissect tissue-specific function and mechanism of interstitial fibrosis resulting from defective Invs, two conditional mouse knockout models were generated: (1) targeting Invs deletion in epithelial cells of the distal nephron (Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre mice), and (2) deleting Invs in stromal cells (Invsflox/flox;Foxd1-Cre mice). Epithelial-specific knockout of Invs resulted in renal cyst formation and severe stromal fibrosis, while stromal-specific knockout displayed no observable phenotypes up to the young adult stage.Further investigation revealed that increased cell proliferation and myofibroblast activation occurred early during disease progression and preceded detectable cyst formation in the Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre kidney. Concomitant removal of cilia partially suppressed the phenotypes of the Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre mutant kidney, suggesting a significant interaction of cilia and Invs function in vivo.Finally, the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) reduced cyst burden, decreased cell proliferation, and ameliorated kidney function decline in Invs mutant mice, suggesting VPA as a potential candidate drug for treating NPHP.
 The extinct Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) was a whale-sized marine mammal that lived in the North Pacific during the Miocene to 1768. Despite first-hand accounts of their biology, little is known about the physiological adjustments underlying their evolution to exploit the harsh coastal climate. A study revealed that the adult-expressed hemoglobin (Hb) of this sirenian has a fixed amino acid replacement at an otherwise invariant position (β/δ82Lys→Asn) that alters multiple aspects of Hb function.First, the functional characterization of recombinant sirenian Hb proteins demonstrated that the Hb-O2 affinity of this sub-Arctic species was less affected by temperature than those of living tropical sea cows. This phenotype presumably safeguarded O2 delivery to cool peripheral tissues and largely arises from a reduced intrinsic temperature sensitivity of the H. gigas protein. Additionally, the β/δ82Asn→Lys mutant Hb further revealed that this exchange renders Steller's sea cow Hb unresponsive to the potent intraerythrocytic allosteric effector 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), a radical modification that is the first documented example of this phenotype among mammals.Furthermore, the β/δ82Lys→Asn replacement underlies the secondary evolution of a reduced blood-O2 affinity phenotype that would have promoted heightened tissue and maternal/fetal O2 delivery. This conclusion is supported by analyses of two Steller's sea cow prenatal Hb proteins (Hb Gower I; ζ2ε2 and HbF; α2γ2) that suggest an exclusive embryonic stage expression pattern and reveal uncommon replacements in H. gigas HbF (γ38Thr→Ile and γ101Glu→Asp) that increased Hb-O2 affinity relative to dugong HbF.Finally, the β/δ82Lys→Asn replacement increases protein solubility, which may have elevated red blood cell Hb content within both the adult and fetal circulations and contributed to meeting the elevated metabolic requirements and fetal growth rates associated with this species' cold adaptation.The Steller's sea cow's underwater foraging time is dictated by onboard oxygen stores and the efficiency of their use. While sirenians are proficient divers, they do not exhibit the greatly elevated body O2 stores or an enhanced dive reflex common to other marine mammals. Instead, their secondary transition to aquatic life coincided with a rapid evolution of their Hb encoding genes due to gene conversion events with a neighboring globin pseudogene. The resulting high blood-O2 affinity phenotype presumably allows extant sea cows to maximize O2 extraction from the lungs during submergence at the cost of somewhat reduced O2 offloading, thus lowering the overall metabolic intensity and fostering a prolonged breath-hold capacity. However, the limited thermoregulatory capacity of extant sea cows confines them to subtropical waters. Fossil evidence and first-hand accounts of the sub-Arctic Steller's sea cow provide insights into the biological and morphological adaptations of this extinct species, while retrieved ancient genetic material has been instrumental in clarifying its phylogenetic affinities and population history.
 The study describes the use of the RasV12 gene to generate continuous cell lines from Drosophila melanogaster primary cultures, specifically for muscle, glial, and epithelial cell types. The researchers used lineage-restricted RasV12 expression with tissue-specific Gal4 drivers to produce targeted cells with a competitive advantage, resulting in the generation of cell lines with expected cell-type-specific phenotypes. The approach was successful in generating cell lines for muscle, glial, and epithelial cell types, and could potentially be used to generate lines for any cell type with an appropriate Gal4 driver. The researchers also tested different genotypes to determine if the success rate could be improved, but found that primary cultures expressing RasV12 without modulation or a survival factor produced lines with similar success rates for the btl-Gal4 or 24B/how-Gal4 drivers. The cells will be valuable for both low- and high-throughput approaches, including genetic or compound screens, and most of the cells have an attP-flanked cassette, making them amenable to insertion of transgenes. The cells will also be useful for generating disease models and investigating cell form and function in co-cultures. The method and the cells will be useful for generating new cell lines in the desired mutant background or editing existing cell lines using CRISPR or insertion of transgenes using the attP site. The researchers used the following fly stocks for creating primary cell lines: Gal4 drivers (24B/how-Gal4, repo-Gal4, btl-Gal4, Act5C-GeneSwitch-Gal4), transgenes (UAS-RasV12, UAS-RasV12 with RMCE site, UAS-GFP nuclear, bratdsRNA, UAS-p35 baculovirus death inhibitor, and Gal80ts), and methods included egg collection, embryo disruption, and cell culture.
 Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are specialized epithelial cells that line various surfaces and assemble multiple motile cilia for fluid flow. During their differentiation, MCCs undergo massive centriole amplification, which is essential for multiciliogenesis. PLK4, a master regulator of centriole biogenesis, is required for centriole assembly in cycling cells but its role in MCCs is unclear.To address this question, researchers created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are crucial for centriole amplification in MCCs. Tracheal epithelial cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results suggest that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs and that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events.PLK4 is recruited to the surface of both parent centrioles and deuterosomes in MCCs. However, recent work has shown that inhibiting PLK4 kinase activity with the ATP-competitive small molecule centrinone has no impact on centriole amplification in mouse multiciliated ependymal cells or mTECs. ShRNA-mediated depletion of PLK4 modestly delays centriole assembly in mTECs but does not reduce the final number of centrioles produced or the fraction of cells forming motile cilia. These data suggest that there are distinct requirements for PLK4 in promoting centriole assembly in cycling cells and differentiating mouse MCCs.The researchers used genetic approaches to define the requirements of PLK4 protein and kinase activity for centriole amplification in MCCs. They also investigated the impact of blocking centriole amplification on the differentiation and surface area scaling of MCCs. Their data show that PLK4 protein and kinase activity are required for centriole assembly in mouse MCCs, demonstrating that the early stages of centriole assembly are similar in cycling cells and MCCs. Moreover, they show that centriole amplification drives an increase in apical surface area in airway MCCs, suggesting that increased centriole number is a central driver of surface area scaling in MCCs.
 This study investigates the origin of epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium during endometrial repair using a mouse model and single cell RNA sequencing. The researchers identified a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. To confirm their hypothesis, the researchers used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts and stromal perivascular cells. They demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings have implications for understanding endometrial pathologies and other mucosal tissues.
 Burkholderia thailandensis, an environmental isolate, exhibits genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity due to a phase variation system driven by RecA-mediated homologous recombination between IS2-like elements. This system allows the bacterium to adapt quickly to environments demanding different lifestyles, such as planktonic and biofilm growth. The IS elements provide homologous sequences for amplification of a chromosomal region containing 157 genes, which promotes biofilm formation when present in multiple copies and enhances planktonic growth with a single copy. The presence of two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region in the chromosome results in a heterogeneous population, optimized for either planktonic or sessile growth, representing a bet-hedging strategy for population survival in fluctuating environments. This phase variation system likely evolved through the acquisition of ISα and ISβ elements.
 The rate and accuracy of translation in bacteria hinges on multiple components, including transfer RNA (tRNA) pools, tRNA modifying enzymes, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. While redundancy in these components is hypothesized to evolve under selection driven by its impacts on growth rate, empirical measurements of the fitness costs and benefits of redundancy are lacking. In this study, researchers manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of Escherichia coli by deleting 28 tRNA genes, 3 tRNA modifying systems, and 4 rRNA operons in various combinations.They found that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful but costly under nutrient limitation. This nutrient-dependent cost of redundant tRNA genes stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate, and therefore varies as a function of the maximum growth rate attainable in a given nutrient niche. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. Importantly, these effects are contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing.The results suggest both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species' evolutionary history with feasts and famines. The fitness costs and benefits of redundancy should ultimately be shaped by nutrient availability, but redundancy may itself arise via different mechanisms for different translation components, and hence selection may shape the components in distinct ways. For instance, with rRNAs, the loss of GCN redundancy is buffered by strong compensatory upregulation of 'backup' gene copies. However, tRNA pools are not similarly regulated, and the impacts of redundancy on growth rate and other growth parameters vary across different tRNA genes and growth media. Further studies are needed to fully understand the evolution and impacts of redundancy in translation components.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented increase in sequencing data for SARS-CoV-2, making existing tools for exploring phylogenies inadequate for handling the large datasets. Taxonium is a new web-based tool that uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser, making it the first tool to enable the interactive examination of such large phylogenies. Taxonium supports mutation-annotated trees, which capture all known genetic variation in a dataset, and can be run entirely locally, from a server-based backend, or as a desktop application.Taxonium provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution by allowing the exploration of a tree of over five million sequences. It also offers a public tree of more than five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences for exploration at cov2tree.org. Taxonium can be applied to any tree and is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium.Genomic researchers responded to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 by collaborating at an unprecedented scale, generating open protocols for amplicon sequencing and storing the resulting datasets in the INSDC databases and GISAID. The fundamental representation of a viral epidemic for genomic epidemiology is a phylogenetic tree, which approximates the transmission tree and allows insights into the direction of migration of viral lineages.The construction of phylogenetic trees and the visualization of these trees have been major bottlenecks preventing full-scale analyses. Two broad responses to this issue are downsampling the sequences or developing new tools that operate on large datasets directly without downsampling. Taxonium is an example of the latter approach, allowing for the exploration of large trees with millions of nodes in a responsive and efficient manner.
 This study demonstrates that RNA elements, specifically PRRE motifs and a GA-rich element in the 3′ UTR of the mouse Net1 RNA, regulate RNA localization in both epithelial and neuronal cells. The findings suggest that these elements specify that an RNA should be trafficked to the plus end of microtubules, wherever that may be in a given cell type, opening up the possibility of predicting the localization of an RNA in a given cell type if its localization in another cell type is known. The study also reveals that RP mRNAs, which are enriched in neurites and the basal pole of epithelial cells, are trafficked to these locations through the action of kinesin motor proteins. The results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying RNA trafficking and suggest that similar mechanisms operate in different cell types and species. The study was conducted using C2bbe1, HCA-7, MDCK cells, and CAD neuronal cells. The researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 to integrate a loxP-flanked blasticidin resistance cassette into the AAVS1 safe harbor of C2bbe1 and HCA-7 cells, and cre-mediated recombination to switch on doxycycline-inducible expression of transgenes and reporter transcripts. Halo-seq was used to assay RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of C2bbe1 monolayers, and the results showed that apical-Halo and basal-Halo fusion proteins produced less biotinylated RNA than the cytoplasmic-Halo fusion but recovered significantly more RNA following streptavidin pulldown from cells treated with DBF than control untreated cells. The study also identified 1192 genes that were significantly cytoplasmically enriched and 715 genes that were significantly depleted in the cytoplasm, and lncRNAs had significantly lower CB values, indicating that Halo-seq was faithfully reporting on RNA localization in C2bbe1 cells. The study also found that LARP1 mediates the basal localization of PRRE-containing RNAs in epithelial monolayers and the neurite localization of the same RNAs in neuronal cells. The findings suggest that the RNA contents of both locations are determined at least in part through microtubule plus-end directed trafficking mechanisms. The study also found that a GA-rich region in the 3′ UTR of the mouse Net1 RNA is necessary and sufficient to drive RNAs both to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells and the basal pole of human epithelial cells. The study also found that a GA-rich region in the 3′ UTR of human NET1 RNA was also identified as necessary for the localization of the transcript to the leading edges of migrating cells, dependent on transport by KIF1C. Overall, the study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying RNA trafficking and suggests that similar mechanisms operate in different cell types and species.
 Aging is a complex process associated with various phenotypic changes at the cellular and tissue levels, including genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, chronic low-level inflammation (inflammaging), immunosenescence, and impaired regeneration. Some studies suggest that an increase in transcriptional noise is a hallmark of aging. However, the relationship between aging and transcriptional noise remains unclear, and previous analyses have been confounded by various factors, including computational methods and biological sources of variability.To systematically compare the most important families of methods used to quantify age-related transcriptional noise, the authors developed Decibel, a Python toolkit. Decibel implements four commonly used methods for quantifying age-related transcriptional noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data: biological variation over technical variation, gene-based Euclidean distance, Euclidean distance to the cell type mean using invariant genes, and global coordination level (GCL).Additionally, the authors developed Scallop, a novel computational method for quantifying membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. Cells with a greater Scallop membership score are transcriptionally more stable. Application of these computational tools to seven aging datasets showed large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging.The authors also investigated cell type-specific effects on transcriptional noise by focusing on the aging lung. They found that club cells and interstitial fibroblasts showed increased transcriptional noise, while alveolar macrophages seemed to decrease it. However, a single-cell analysis of alveolar macrophages did not identify distinct clusters associated with mouse or human aging, suggesting that changes in the aged alveolar microenvironment are key for their altered functionalities.In humans, they analyzed two aging lung datasets and found no consistency between the two datasets regarding transcriptional noise of the 30 specific cell types detected. However, both in human and mouse lungs, they detected a shift in the abundance of a number of cell populations with age, most clearly seen for immune cells. The age-associated increase in immune cell infiltration of solid organs may be generalized.The authors suggest that the sources of the apparent increase in transcriptional noise reported by previous studies may be multiple and are mostly related to the computational methods used to characterize transcriptional noise and cellular identity in aged tissues. They propose that Scallop, which measures transcriptional noise by membership to cell type-specific clusters, is a better choice for measuring loss of cell type identity compared to DTC methods.In summary, the authors' results suggest that transcriptional noise is not a bona fide hallmark of aging. Instead, they posit that previous analyses of noise in aging scRNAseq datasets have been confounded by various factors, including both computational methods used for analysis and other biology-driven sources of variability. The open availability of Decibel and Scallop represents an opportunity for the aging research community to further investigate these issues.
 Tumour heterogeneity is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment due to the presence of drug-resistant clonal lineages. Identifying the characteristics of these lineages that underpin resistance to therapy has remained challenging. In this study, clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq (Wholistic Interrogation of Lineage Dynamics by sequencing) was used to understand response and resistance to therapy, including BET bromodomain inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy, in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).WILD-seq utilizes a lentiviral library to label cells with an expressed, heritable barcode that enables identification of clonal lineage in conjunction with single-cell RNA sequencing. The platform was optimized to ensure recurrent representation of clonal lineages across animals and samples, facilitating analysis of clonal dynamics under the selective pressure of therapeutic intervention.Analysis of response of TNBC models to frontline taxane-based chemotherapy revealed an enrichment of clones with high levels of NRF2 signaling, implicating defense against oxidative damage as a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. These NRF2-high, taxane-resistant lineages were found to be collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation as a result of L-asparaginase treatment and adapted to this second-line intervention by up-regulating de novo asparagine synthesis.These findings demonstrate the utility of WILD-seq for identifying mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy that are also operative in patients and pinpointing asparagine bioavailability as a druggable vulnerability of taxane-resistant lineages. The platform can be applied to other cancer types and therapeutic interventions to gain a deeper understanding of tumour evolution and response to treatment.
 DMRT1 is a testis-determining factor in several species of vertebrates, but its role in mammalian testes differentiation is ambiguous. In mammals, SRY is the testis-determining gene, but DMRT1 has roles in both germ cells and supporting cells in the testis. In the rabbit, DMRT1 is required for testis differentiation since XY DMRT1−/− rabbits show early male-to-female sex reversal with differentiating ovaries and complete female genitalia. However, germ cells failed to undergo meiosis, and follicles did not form in XY and XX DMRT1−/− mutant ovaries, leading to female infertility. DMRT1 is also crucial for female fertility, as XX DMRT1−/− adult females were sterile. These phenotypes indicate an evolutionary continuum between non-mammalian vertebrates and non-rodent mammals. Additionally, DMRT1 mutations have been linked to human pathologies such as Disorders of Sex Development and male and female infertility. The rabbit model was chosen to further investigate DMRT1 functions in non-rodent mammals, and a DMRT1 knock-out line was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The results confirmed that DMRT1 is a testis-determining factor in mammals and is also required for female fertility.
 Obesity, a global epidemic disease, is caused by the accumulation of excessive or abnormal amounts of fat, which poses a significant threat to health. High-fat diets (HFDs) are a leading contributor to obesity and are responsible for approximately 2.5 million deaths yearly. Understanding the mechanism of obesity requires careful consideration of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Drosophila, a simplified model of metabolic diseases, has emerged as an effective tool for investigating lipid metabolism and homeostasis.CTPS, an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of CTP, is crucial for regulating body weight and starvation resistance in Drosophila. HFD-induced obesity leads to increased transcription of CTPS and elongates cytoophidia in larval adipocytes. Depleting CTPS in the fat body prevents HFD-induced obesity, including body weight gain, adipocyte expansion, and lipid accumulation, by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis. Additionally, a dominant-negative form of CTPS also prevents adipocyte expansion and downregulates lipogenic genes.CTPS is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of amide nitrogen from glutamine to the C-4 position of UTP, requiring ATP. It can form filamentous structures called cytoophidia, which are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. CTPS cytoophidia have several functions, including modulation of enzymatic activity, maintenance of cell morphology, and stabilization of CTPS protein. They have been found in several human cancers, indicating their potential role in maintaining tissue homeostasis.The Drosophila fat body, an organ with high metabolic activity and conserved signaling pathways, plays a crucial role in sensing nutritional conditions and responding through the integration of lipid metabolism. Our study reveals that HFD feeding results in an upregulation of CTPS transcription and an elongation of CTPS cytoophidia in the fat body. CTPS depletion in adipose tissue leads to decreased body weight and increased susceptibility to starvation during food deprivation. The absence of cytoophidia, as the result of reduced CTPS expression or the expression of a dominant-negative mutant CTPS protein, leads to a reduction in HFD-induced adipocyte expansion and TAG level, strongly supporting the role of cytoophidia in adipocyte growth and lipogenesis in response to HFD.In summary, our study provides evidence for the essential role of CTPS in regulating adipocyte growth and lipid metabolism in Drosophila through the activation of the PI3K-Akt-SREBP pathway. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether this mechanism is also present in mammalian adipose tissue and in other tissues, such as the liver. A more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between diverse cellular processes in maintaining lipid homeostasis could lead to the advancement of knowledge regarding metabolic disorders and energy homeostasis.
 During vertebrate embryogenesis, the germ layers are patterned by secreted Nodal signals, which bind to a complex comprising Type I/II Activin receptors and the co-receptor Tdgf1. In zebrafish, three Type I (Acvr1) and four Type II (Acvr2) homologs were identified, and all receptor-encoding transcripts were found to be maternally deposited and present during embryogenesis. Loss of individual receptor function did not cause obvious patterning defects, but severe patterning phenotypes and embryonic lethality were observed with combinatorial loss of putative Type II Acvr receptors. The Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b were identified as the main mediators of Nodal signaling in zebrafish. Feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors were found to directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.
 Type I interferon (IFN-I) responses are crucial for host defense against viral infections, and the production of IFN-I is tightly controlled through cellular decision-making processes. Recent studies have challenged the long-held belief that the initiation of IFN-I production is stochastically regulated, suggesting that host-intrinsic factors play a deterministic role in dictating early IFN-I responses.Using a murine fibroblast reporter model, researchers have investigated the influence of various stochastic and deterministic factors on early IFN-I responses. Epigenetic drugs have been shown to influence the percentage of responding cells, providing evidence for transient heritability driving responder fates. The Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test has been used to verify the transient nature of this heritability. Additionally, cell density has been found to play a role in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing.Together, these findings open up new avenues for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses, which can be translated to other immune signaling systems. The ability to revise the fundamentals of cellular decision-making has the potential to lead to improved IFN-mediated immune therapies.The study utilized a murine fibroblast model to investigate early IFN-I response dynamics, focusing on the detection of first responding cells and the effects of various host-intrinsic factors on their behavior. The researchers used a NIH3T3:IRF7-CFP reporter cell line to monitor signaling dynamics during the early phase of IFN-I response dynamics, and an unbiased automated image analysis script to detect first responders based on the translocation of fluorescent signal corresponding with IRF7 molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The study also explored the response dynamics using a NIH3T3:STAT1-CFP/STAT2-YFP fibroblast reporter cell line, and investigated the manipulation of cellular decision-making by altering the cells' epigenetic profile.The results showed that the cellular decision to become a first responder is at least partly epigenetically regulated via both methylation and histone acetylation. The study also demonstrated that the fraction of first responders increases upon hypomethylation and activation, and that the classical Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test can reveal a yet unknown, deterministic phenomenon which dictates responsiveness, which seems to overrule stochasticity.Overall, this systems immunology approach highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between stochasticity and determinism in cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses, and the potential implications for other immune signaling systems. The findings pave the way for improved IFN-mediated immune therapies and a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the immune response.
 Microtubules (MTs) are built from α- and β-tubulin heterodimers and serve as tracks for various cellular cargos, including mRNAs, proteins, and organelles. In Drosophila melanogaster, four α-tubulin genes are expressed, with three of them contributing to the formation of microtubules during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Among these, αTub84B and αTub84D are highly similar, while αTub67C is expressed exclusively during oogenesis and has a distinct primary structure. MTs undergo several post-translational modifications (PTMs), including C-terminal tail glutamylation, glycylation, and detyrosination/tyrosination. Glutamylation is a critical PTM that adds one or more glutamic acids to the sidechains of glutamic acid residues in the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin, forming a branched peptide chain.In this study, researchers focused on the role of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of α-tubulins during Drosophila oogenesis. They found that αTub84B and αTub84D are glutamylated at their C-terminal ends, while αTub67C is not. The C-terminal ends of αTub84B and αTub84D contain several glutamyl sidechains in various combinations. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian αTub84B and αTub84D, and its absence leads to the mislocalization of glutamylated microtubules and the disruption of kinesin-1-dependent processes, such as the precise localization of Staufen and fast, bidirectional ooplasmic streaming.Furthermore, TTLL5 plays a role in the nervous system, where its inactivation decreases the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria. Overall, this study demonstrates the in vivo importance of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of α-tubulins and highlights the significance of α-tubulin glutamylation for various cellular functions involving microtubule transport.
 GENESPACE is a computational pipeline designed to address challenges in leveraging information across multiple genomes by integrating conserved gene order and orthology. It utilizes synteny, or the conserved order of DNA sequences among chromosomes that share a common ancestor, to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. GENESPACE has demonstrated utility in various contexts, including studying sex chromosome evolution, grass family diversity, and maize cultivars. It offers significant improvements over existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes. The pipeline operates on a foundational assumption that homologs should be exactly single copy within any syntenic region between a pair of genomes, and addresses complexities such as tandem arrays and gene presence-absence variation. GENESPACE's sensitivity pipeline infers syntenic regions, and it produces a greater percentage of single-copy syntenic blocks and genes in single chromosome orthogroups than other methods. It also outperforms simple integration between methods and provides a more comprehensive view of gene family evolution in various taxa.
 In polymicrobial communities, most bacteria exist and interact with each other, producing unique compounds, increasing virulence, and augmenting antibiotic resistance. One such community associated with negative healthcare outcomes consists of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. When co-cultured, virulence factors secreted by P. aeruginosa reduce metabolism and growth in S. aureus, allowing it to drive S. aureus toward extinction in vitro. However, both species can co-exist in vivo. Previous studies suggest that altered gene expression or mutations may account for this discrepancy, but little is known about how the growth environment influences their co-existence.Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation, researchers have shown that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. They found that changing the carbon source in growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric they call absolute growth. As a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa.The relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. These findings demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species, provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations.In this study, researchers used P. aeruginosa strain PA14 and S. aureus strain RN4220, along with their mutants ΔpqsL, ΔpvdA/ΔpchE, and ΔpqsL/ΔpvdA/ΔpchE. They investigated the effect of different carbon sources on the growth and metabolism of both species and their interactions using a 96-well plate reader and bioluminescent assays. They found that changes in carbon sources led to differences in absolute growth between both bacterial species, which influenced their co-existence.The researchers also used an agent-based model to estimate the trends in spatial overlap (δ) of the two populations under various disturbance conditions. They found that reducing the value of δ, which represents the spatial distribution of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa during disturbance, decreases the effect of these virulence factors on S. aureus. The findings provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, as disturbance at intermediate frequencies facilitates the co-existence of both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, while in continually and undisturbed environments, P. aeruginosa dominated the co-culture.Manipulation of absolute growth using different carbon sources may also serve to rationally increase the efficacy of antibiotics. For example, carbon sources that cause S. aureus to have a significantly greater absolute growth relative to P. aeruginosa would limit the growth of P. aeruginosa, reducing the total concentration of HQNO produced and allowing the metabolism of S. aureus to remain relatively high, promoting the efficacy of antibiotics. Conversely, promoting the production of P. aeruginosa by using carbon sources that increase its absolute growth relative to S. aureus would augment the production of HQNO, increasing the membrane permeability of S. aureus found in biofilms and augmenting sensitivity to certain antibiotics.In summary, the study demonstrates that differences in growth environment can significantly impact the co-existence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, providing insights into the complex interactions between these bacterial species and their role in polymicrobial communities. The findings have implications for understanding the dynamics of bacterial populations in various niches and may offer potential strategies for manipulating their behavior in clinical settings.
 The field of biology is generating an increasing amount of data, particularly in the area of interspecies interactions between diverse groups of species. However, there is a lack of methods for capturing knowledge about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions in a way that is amenable to data-driven research. To address this, a framework has been developed for curating scientific literature on interspecies interactions, using the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base) as a case study.The framework includes a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen–host interaction data at the levels of host, pathogen, strain, gene, and genotype. The concept of a multispecies genotype, or 'metagenotype,' is introduced to facilitate capturing changes in disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility, which can be due to gene alterations.PHI-Canto, a community curation tool, has been developed for use by publication authors. It is an extension of the PomBase Canto tool, which already supports annotating genes from multiple species in the same curation session but could not previously support annotation of interspecies interactions or annotation of genes from naturally occurring strains.The development of curation tools with clear workflows and support for biological ontologies and controlled vocabularies has standardized curation efforts, reduced ambiguity, and improved the maintenance of curated data as biological knowledge evolves. The pathogen–host interaction research community is an example of a domain exhibiting a literature deluge, and PHI-base is an open-access database containing data on bacterial, fungal, and protist genes proven to affect (or not affect) the outcome of pathogen–host interactions. Since 2005, PHI-base has manually curated phenotype data associated with underlying genome-level changes from peer-reviewed pathogen–host interaction literature.The curation of interspecies interactions requires the use of metagenotypes, which represent the combination of a pathogen genotype and a host genotype. Metagenotypes can be annotated with pathogen–host interaction phenotypes to capture changes in pathogenicity and virulence. The curation process involves annotating genes, genotypes, and metagenotypes with terms from controlled vocabularies, including the Pathogen–Host Interaction Phenotype Ontology (PHIPO), and supporting annotations with experimental evidence and conditions.PHI-Canto uses the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) for retrieving protein entities, gene names, and species information for display in PHI-Canto. It also supports the annotation of interspecies interactions using the concept of a metagenotype, which is created after the individual genotypes from both species are created. Each metagenotype can be annotated with pathogen–host interaction phenotypes to capture changes in pathogenicity and virulence.The curation framework described here is a suitable approach for adoption and use by a wide range of research communities in the life sciences focused on different types of interspecies interactions occurring within or across kingdoms in different environments and at multiple scales. The use of stable identifiers, such as those provided by UniProtKB, is essential for annotating entities in curation contexts. PHI-Canto's curation workflows maintain support for nine high-level terms that describe phenotypic outcomes essential for taxonomically diverse interspecies comparisons.The development of PHI-Canto involved addressing several challenges, including recording the delivery mechanism used within the pathogen–host interaction experiment and supporting the annotation of physical interactions between proteins from different species. New experimental condition terms were developed with a prefix of 'delivery mechanism,' and the existing Canto module for curating physical interactions was adapted to support two different species. To support the annotation of phenotypes in PHI-Canto, PHIPO was developed, a species-neutral phenotype ontology that describes a broad range of pathogen–host interaction phenotypes. PHI-Canto also includes a 'disease name' annotation type for annotating the name of the disease caused by an interaction between the pathogen and host specified in a wild-type metagenotype. PHI-Canto's curation process is outlined in Figure 4, and curation tutorials are available on the PHI-base YouTube channel.
 This study utilized F1 hybrids derived from crosses between C57BL/6 J mice and nine inbred mouse lines to identify sequence variants that impact enhancer function. The researchers found that sequence variants within the central ~50 bp of enhancer sequences were most likely to lead to an allele-specific change in enhancer activity. They also observed that AP-1 binding is often required for TEAD TF binding to enhancers, while TEAD is generally dispensable for AP-1 TF binding. The data suggest that enhancer priming/selection and activation are not separable steps mediated by distinct TF-binding events at enhancers in MEFs. The study also revealed that SNPs outside of core TF-binding motifs can collectively modulate enhancer activity. The findings provide new insight into the crosstalk between Ras/MAPK and Hippo/YAP/TAZ/TEAD signal-dependent gene expression and suggest that Ras/MAPK-induced AP-1 can play an instructive role in determining the output of Hippo/YAP/TAZ/TEAD-dependent transcriptional programs.
 This study identifies the dynein activating adaptor NINL as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and a target of viral antagonism. NINL has evolved under recurrent positive selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region, making it unique among dynein, dynactin, and activating adaptor genes. NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in increased permissiveness to viral replication. Proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. These findings reveal the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of host–virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.
 Actin isoforms are essential structural proteins in eukaryotic cells, and despite their high sequence and structure conservation, subtle differences determine their interaction with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins. In this study, high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle α-actin (3.37 Å), cardiac muscle α-actin (3.07 Å), β-actin (2.99 Å), and γ-actin (3.38 Å) in the Mg2+·ADP state with native post-translational modifications were obtained. The structures revealed isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus, which establish isoform-specific interfaces for myosin binding. These structures complement the repertoire of known actin structures and provide insights into the in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms.The structures were determined using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and revealed local resolutions ranging from 2.1 to 3.5 Å for skeletal muscle α-actin, 1.9-3.3 Å for cardiac muscle α-actin, 1.5-3.0 Å for β-actin, and 2.1-4.4 Å for γ-actin. All actin structures were solved without the use of stabilizing drugs. The structures showed that the N-termini of bare muscle and nonmuscle actins have different orientations, contributing to distinct binding interfaces for myosin motors and likely other actin-binding proteins.The actin filament is composed of G-actin protomers that assemble into a double-stranded helix. Each protomer consists of four subdomains (SD1-SD4), and the nucleotide-binding cleft and barbed end groove are formed by SD2 and SD3, respectively. The nucleotide-binding cleft harbors the active site, and the barbed end groove mediates longitudinal interfaces within the actin filament. The longitudinal interface between two adjacent actin protomers involves the extended D-loop located in SD2 of one actin protomer that interacts with amino acids located in SD1 and SD3 of another protomer.The structures of single-isotype actin isoforms revealed subtle differences, including minor differences near the nucleotide-binding cleft that may contribute to the reported differences in the biochemistries of actin isoforms. The comparison of longitudinal and transverse interprotomer interfaces revealed that the transverse interface is more conserved, with only one amino acid substitution (V286/I287) at the intersection of the longitudinal and transverse interfaces. The absence of amino acid substitutions in SD2 and conserved interactions between the SD2 D-loop and amino acids of SD1 and SD3 suggests selective pressure to maintain this critical structural element.The most prominent structural change between bare actin isoforms corresponds to the N-terminus location. Given the well-established central role of the N-terminus in the interactions with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins, these structural changes may dictate different biochemical interactions. For example, actin isoform-specific interfaces with myosin motors may involve a more subtle movement of the N-terminus rather than a large conformational change through a pulling mechanism.Cryo-EM studies were conducted by polymerizing G-actin with a 10× stock solution of buffer containing 0.5 M KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.1 M MOPS pH 7.0 before plunge freezing. Data collection was performed on a Titan Krios G3i operated at 300 kV, equipped with a K3 direct electron detector, a Bioquantum energy filter, and a Cs image corrector. Segments of actin filaments were picked using the template-free tracing method implemented in the filament tracer module in cryoSPARC, and 3D refinements were performed using the helical refinement module in cryoSPARC. Model building was carried out using sharpened maps and a common approach of model building, refinement, and validation for all actin isoforms. The final actin models were refined using Phenix and validated using MolProbity.
 Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences (TARDIS) is a novel approach to transgenesis that overcomes the limitations of multicellular systems and increases transgenesis throughput up to 1000-fold. TARDIS uses synthesized sequence libraries and inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences from these heritable libraries into engineered genomic sites. The method was developed in Caenorhabditis elegans but is adaptable to any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated.TARDIS splits the transgenesis process into a two-step process: creation of individuals carrying experimentally introduced sequence libraries, followed by inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components into engineered genomic sites. This results in thousands of genetically unique transgenic individuals.The power of TARDIS was demonstrated by generating a large set of individually barcoded lineages and transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries. The system increased transformation yields up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods.TARDIS is a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional single-copy transgenesis and has the potential to expand the impact of exploratory transgenesis in functional domains that are dependent on multicellular interactions, such as inter-tissue signaling, neuronal health, and animal behavior. The approach is adaptable for any situation where the sequences for integration can be introduced with high diversity and heritability, and where a genomic site for integration can be made or is available.
 In gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) undergo a complex journey from the cytosol to their final destination in the outer membrane. Multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes facilitate the translocation and assembly of OMPs. Using AF2Complex, a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline, researchers identified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and applied it to several proteins from the OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, unexpected interactions were discovered, providing insights into the mechanisms of OMP biogenesis.The OMP biogenesis pathway involves several core complexes, including the SecYEG translocon and the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM). The SecYEG translocon, a hetero-trimer composed of SecY, SecE, and SecG, is responsible for moving most cell envelope proteins across the inner membrane. Periplasmic and outer membrane proteins enter the channel in SecY via the SecA-dependent translocation pathway, and the signal peptide at the N-terminus of a substrate contains a hydrophobic segment that folds into a transmembrane α-helix once it exits the lateral gate of SecY. To release the substrate from the inner membrane, a type I signal peptidase (SPase I) cleaves the signal peptide.After the signal peptide is cleaved, a periplasmic protein has reached its destination, but an OMP continues its journey toward BAM. Five subunits constitute BAM, with BamA playing the major role in folding a β-barrel and releasing the matured product. However, many open questions remain concerning the OMP biogenesis pathway, particularly the identities and structures of the proteins involved in forming supercomplexes.To address these questions, researchers used AF2Complex to search for interacting proteins within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and identified several key interactions, including those between PpiD and YfgM, PpiD and SecY, and DsbA and PpiD. These interactions provided insights into the mechanisms of OMP biogenesis and the roles of various chaperones and proteases in the process.In summary, the use of AF2Complex in combination with deep learning models and an effective PPI ranking metric allowed researchers to uncover the molecular mechanisms of the OMP biogenesis pathway and identify key interactions between various proteins involved in the process. These results demonstrate the potential of deep learning strategies in exploring the conformational ensemble of proteins and elucidating complex biochemical pathways.
 Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), are crucial regulators of basal ganglia functions, motivation, and cognition. The connectivity of DA neurons is predominantly non-synaptic, with a majority of DA-releasing terminals not in close apposition to a postsynaptic domain. A smaller synaptic subset of DA neuron terminals has the ability to co-release glutamate or GABA. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of DA neuron axonal arbors and release sites are largely unknown.Recent studies suggest that neuroligins (NLs), trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, regulate both DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission. Neuroligins interact with neurexins (Nrxns), presynaptic cell adhesion molecules, but the role of Nrxns in DA neurons is unexplored.To test the hypothesis that Nrxns regulate DA neuron neurotransmission, mice with conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::NrxnsKO) were generated. These mice exhibited normal basic motor functions but impaired locomotor response to the psychostimulant amphetamine. DA signaling was impacted, as revealed by slower DA reuptake, decreased density of DA transporter (DAT), increased density of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), and reduced activity-dependent DA release. Electrophysiological recordings showed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of these mice.Nrxns have been suggested to contribute to the development of synapses, but they do not act as necessary drivers of axon terminal and synapse formation by DA neurons. Instead, they regulate the kinetics of DAo and GABA release by DA neurons. Further studies are necessary to decipher the role of potential candidates, including proteins from the leucocyte antigen receptor-protein tyrosine-phosphatases family, in regulating DA neuron connectivity.The findings from this study shed new light on the role of Nrxns in DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission. Nrxns are dispensable for the initial establishment of axon terminals and synapses by DA neurons but play a role in regulating both the kinetics of DAo and GABA release by DA neurons. Only a small subset of axon terminals established by DA neurons adopt a synaptic configuration, and the formation of such synaptic contacts must be regulated by other trans-synaptic proteins.
 This study examines mobile phone ownership in 33 African countries and its relationship to proximity to a health clinic, as well as inequities in ownership based on gender, urban-rural residency, age, and poverty. The study finds that 82% of individuals in these countries own mobile phones, with 42% owning basic phones and 40% owning smartphones. Individuals who live closer to a health clinic are more likely to own a mobile phone, and men and urban residents are more likely to own smartphones. Ownership decreases with age and poverty. The study also finds that some of the poorest individuals own smartphones, and ownership increases with proximity to a health clinic. These findings have implications for designing and implementing mobile health interventions in Africa, as equitable access to digital devices is necessary to avoid propagating existing healthcare access inequities.
 This study aimed to examine variables associated with variation in post-vaccination antibody levels and the subsequent likelihood of post-vaccination infection to SARS-CoV-2. The study used data from two population-based longitudinal cohorts, TwinsUK and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), during the UK vaccination roll-out. The analysis focused on anti-Spike antibody levels, identified as a correlate of protection against infection, and their relationship with post-vaccination infection.The study found that individuals with the lowest 20% of anti-Spike antibody levels at initial testing had threefold greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the following 6-9 months in TwinsUK. In addition, individuals identified as at increased risk of COVID-19 complications through the UK 'Shielded Patient List' had consistently greater odds (two- to fourfold) of having antibody levels in the lowest 10%. Third vaccination increased absolute antibody levels for almost all individuals and reduced relative disparities compared with earlier vaccinations.The study also found that older individuals, those on the UK 'Shielded Patient List', and those with lower self-rated health were more likely to have received more vaccinations and had lower self-rated health. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection varied according to the measure of infection, vaccination status, socio-demographic variables, and between the two timepoints examined.Cross-sectional antibody levels following third vaccination were much greater and more sustained, with less inter-individual variability, compared to levels for those with fewer vaccinations. Median antibody levels peaked at 9 weeks after first vaccination in both TwinsUK and ALSPAC, and after second vaccination, median levels breached the 250 BAU/mL assay limit from 2 weeks onwards.Individuals with lower antibody responses after first vaccination had increased risk of subsequent infection over the next 6-9 months. Those with anti-Spike levels in the lowest 80% within the sample had two- to threefold odds of post-vaccination infection than those in the highest quintile. Lower antibody levels were also associated with older age, serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to Q2 testing, and retirement status.The study also tested for associations with having lower antibody levels after each round of vaccination. Increased odds of lower antibody levels were consistently observed across multiple vaccination rounds for individuals with certain health-related variables, including those who received the AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine versus BNT162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech), longer time since vaccination at time of sampling, and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to antibody testing. However, the associations were not consistent for all variables, such as very frail, high multimorbidity, rheumatoid arthritis, employment status of permanently or long-term sick or disabled, and lower educational attainment.The study used python and R for data analysis and is available on GitHub. The original antibody test data are available within the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration upon application, and the original TwinsUK and ALSPAC data are available to researchers on application to ensure privacy and protect against misuse.
