Lung-resident mesenchymal stem and stromal cells (LR-MSCs) are crucial for maintaining lung homeostasis and regeneration. However, their role during virus-induced lung injury has not been well studied. This study investigated the function of LR-MSCs during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, a major cause of severe respiratory tract infections in infants. The study found that RSV infects LR-MSCs, leading to a robust activation characterized by a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory phenotype. Infected LR-MSCs showed increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes and released higher levels of cytokines, including CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-6, G-CSF, CCL5/RANTES, IL-9, IFN-γ, IL-5, and L-17. In addition, in vivo infection of newborn lambs with RSV led to the invasion and activation of LR-MSCs, resulting in the expansion of the pulmonary MSC pool. The global transcriptional response of LR-MSCs appeared to follow RSV disease, switching from an early antiviral signature to repair mechanisms including differentiation, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. These findings highlight the involvement of LR-MSCs during virus-mediated acute lung injury and suggest their potential as a therapeutic target for RSV infection.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a protozoan disease endemic in South Sudan, where it is caused by the Leishmania donovani parasite and transmitted by sandflies. The country has one of the highest VL burdens globally, with outbreaks often caused by civil unrest and displacement. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to complications from VL due to changes in their immune system. However, there is limited evidence on the clinical aspects and treatment outcomes of VL in pregnancy.A cohort of pregnant women with VL was studied through a retrospective analysis of routine program data from a MSF health facility in Lankien, Jonglei State, South Sudan, from October 2014 to April 2018. The study compared pregnant women with VL to a random sample of non-pregnant women of reproductive age with VL. The results showed that pregnant women with VL had more severe anemia, were more likely to need blood transfusions, and were more often prescribed antibiotics than non-pregnant women with VL. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage and premature delivery, were reported in 20% of pregnancies where VL was diagnosed in pregnancy and 50% where VL was diagnosed postpartum. Pregnant women were also more likely to require extension of treatment to achieve cure than non-pregnant women with VL.However, overall initial cure rates were high (96.5%), and mortality was low (1.8%) in this cohort of pregnant women with VL. The study suggests that good maternal survival rates are possible in resource-limited settings, despite the high incidence of complications. AmBisome is now considered the safest therapeutic option for VL in pregnancy and is the recommended treatment for this group in South Sudan. The study's findings are essential for improving the clinical management of VL in pregnancy and reducing the burden of this disease in South Sudan.
A study was conducted to genetically characterize 310 S. Typhi isolates from typhoid fever surveillance in Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, between 2007 and 2019. The study aimed to assess the circulating strains, their antimicrobial resistance attributes, and how they relate to global S. Typhi isolates. Whole genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST) identified four clades, with the predominant clade containing 93.5% of the isolates, all of which belonged to genotypes 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2. Resistance determinants were exclusively found in the predominant clade, with 75.8% of the isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR) and 20.0% having quinolone resistance determinants. The prevalence of MDR associated genes remained similar throughout the study period, while the proportion of isolates harboring quinolone resistance determinants increased significantly. The study also found that genotype 4.3.1 has been introduced multiple times in Kibera and several isolates from Kibera formed a clade with genomes from Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, and Tanzania. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring circulating strains of S. Typhi for early detection of antimicrobial resistance patterns to guide on selection of effective antibiotics for patient management.
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) marks the third β-coronavirus to cause significant human mortality in the last two decades, following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Despite the availability of vaccines, their global implementation has been slow, allowing the virus to infect many hosts and evolve into new variants that can evade the immune response elicited by previous infection or vaccination. The RBD of the Spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates the initial attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to its primary receptor ACE2, has undergone substantial antigenic diversity since the initial emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Mutations within RBD and S1 dramatically negate the neutralizing activity of plasma antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2 VoC that are generated from vaccinated or infected individuals and enhance the transmissibility and pathogenicity of VoC.To address this issue, a study identified human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that target a highly conserved region of the S2 domain of the S protein, which is less prone to mutations than the RBD. The most potent and broad hmAb, 1249A8, was able to recognize all human β-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 1249A8 demonstrated significant prophylactic activity in K18 hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A and lineage B Beta, and Omicron VoC. 1249A8 delivered as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal (i.n.) dose to hamsters 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta protected them from weight loss, with therapeutic activity further enhanced when combined with 1213H7, an S1-specific neutralizing hmAb. These results indicate in vivo cooperativity between S1 and S2 specific neutralizing hmAbs and that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential can be induced in humans and can guide universal coronavirus vaccine development.In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in over 5 million deaths worldwide and highlighted the vulnerability of humanity to novel CoV. Despite the rapid development of vaccines exhibiting high levels of efficacy and low levels of side effects, global vaccine implementation has been slow, allowing for the evolution of new variants that have the potential to evade the immune response elicited by previous infection or vaccination. The RBD of the S protein, which mediates the initial attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to its primary receptor ACE2, has undergone substantial antigenic diversity since the initial emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Mutations within RBD and S1 dramatically negate the neutralizing activity of plasma Abs against SARS-CoV-2 VoC that are generated from vaccinated or infected individuals and enhance the transmissibility and pathogenicity of VoC. To address this issue, a study identified hmAbs that target a highly conserved region of the S2 domain of the S protein, which is less prone to mutations than the RBD. The most potent and broad hmAb, 1249A8, was able to recognize all human β-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, demonstrating the universal β-CoV therapeutic potential of S2 hmAb directly. The combination of 1249A8 with the S1-specific hmAb 1213H7 was evaluated for possible synergistic effects and delivered to the respiratory tract for improved dose delivery efficiency.
The yeast Candida parapsilosis metabolizes hydroxyderivatives of benzene and benzoic acid via the 3-oxoadipate and gentisate pathways, which are encoded by two metabolic gene clusters. In this study, the chromosome level assembly of the C. parapsilosis strain CLIB214 was determined and used for transcriptomic and proteomic investigation of cells cultivated on hydroxyaromatic substrates. The genes coding for enzymes and plasma membrane transporters involved in the 3-oxoadipate and gentisate pathways were found to be highly upregulated in a substrate-specific manner. The putative transcriptional factors encoded by the genes OTF1 and GTF1, located within these gene clusters, function as transcriptional activators of the 3-oxoadipate and gentisate pathway, respectively. The activation of both pathways is accompanied by upregulation of genes involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, glyoxylate cycle, amino acid metabolism, and peroxisome biogenesis. The transcriptome and proteome profiles of the cells grown on 4-hydroxybenzoate and 3-hydroxybenzoate, which are metabolized via the 3-oxoadipate and gentisate pathway, respectively, reflect their different connection to central metabolism. Additionally, an unidentified transcription factor could be involved in the 3-oxoadipate pathway regulation, and bicarbonate ions resulting from decarboxylation of hydroxybenzoates contribute to differences in the cell responses to hydroxybenzoates and hydroxybenzenes. The study also highlights the evolutionary paths leading to metabolic adaptations of yeast cells assimilating hydroxyaromatic substrates.
"The ""oracle-supervised Neural Engineering Framework"" (osNEF) is a method for training biologically-detailed spiking neural networks to perform cognitively-relevant computations, using four different neuron models and various synaptic models. OsNEF networks exhibit the target dynamics by accounting for nonlinearities within the neuron models, and can be used to build functional brain models with biologically-detailed components. This allows for the investigation of the relationship between biophysical mechanisms and functional capabilities. Biological detail is important for neural models that seek to bridge the gap between neural and cognitive processes, as it allows for the study of aspects of psychology, such as biologically-grounded mental disorders and their pharmacological treatment, that often cannot be studied with simpler models. However, simulating biological detail often increases the difficulty of building and analyzing cognitive models. OsNEF can train functional brain models using biologically-detailed components, and has been used to create a model of working memory that performs a delayed response task using a combination of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons connected with NMDA and GABA synapses. The model's baseline performance and forgetting rate are consistent with animal data from delayed match-to-sample tasks. OsNEF can be applied to a wide range of neuron models without major changes to the algorithm, and facilitates large-scale functional modelling by allowing modellers to plug in existing neuron models written in Python or NEURON to the general-purpose Nengo simulator. This allows modellers to specify detailed low-level mechanisms like conductance-based synapses, voltage-gated ion channels, and dendritic geometry, then train the network to realize high-level dynamics or computations. OsNEF can be used to construct a variety of functional neural networks from various biologically detailed components, allowing researchers to investigate questions that relate low-level biological details to high-level cognitive capacity."
"Down syndrome (DS) is a common genetic form of intellectual disability caused by the complete or partial trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), resulting in a dosage imbalance hypothesis where a 1.5 increase in transcription is expected. However, transcriptomic studies revealed that triplication of HSA21 does not simply translate into overexpression of HSA21 genes but leads to a genome-wide transcriptional deregulation due to different efficiency in gene transcription based on levels of transcription factors and epigenetic state. A meta-analysis of all available transcriptomic data integrating differential expression analyses of human and mouse datasets comparing trisomic and euploid transcriptomes from different sources was performed, resulting in a DS network. The analysis found that genome-wide deregulation as a consequence of trisomy 21 is not arbitrary, but involves deregulation of specific molecular cascades in which both HSA21 genes and HSA21 interactors are more consistently deregulated compared to other genes. The deregulation happens in ""clusters"" of 2 to 13 genes found consistently deregulated, most of which belong to the same GO category and disease class. The most consistent changes are enriched in interferon-related categories and neutrophil activation, reinforcing the concept that DS is an inflammatory disease. The impact of the trisomy might diverge in each tissue due to the different gene set deregulation, and the method used in the meta-analysis can be used with other complex disorders such as cancer. The analysis not only confirmed the importance of known genes but also detected new ones that could be useful for generating or confirming hypotheses and supporting new putative therapeutic candidates."
Neuronal activity in the human brain can be broadly categorized into ongoing oscillations and evoked responses, which have typically been studied separately. However, these two phenomena may be closely related, with ongoing oscillations modulating evoked responses and evoked responses reflecting changes in certain aspects of neuronal oscillations. The baseline-shift mechanism (BSM) proposes that any amplitude modulation of ongoing oscillations with a non-zero oscillatory mean leads to the generation of evoked responses. This mechanism gives rise to the predictions that post-stimulus oscillations are accompanied by amplitude modulation, the sign and direction of amplitude modulation determine the polarity of an evoked response, and the time and spatial distribution of modulation correlate with both the evoked response time course and spatial topography. Previous research has supported these predictions, but there is ongoing debate about the applicability of the additive, phase reset, and BSM mechanisms to auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked responses. In this study, the authors aimed to verify the prediction about asymmetric currents leading to non-zero OM using a biophysically realistic computational model and a large data set including young and elderly participants with eyes-open and eyes-closed sessions. They also investigated the effects of spatial synchronization within a network with population modeling using simple oscillators. The study found that amplitude modulation plays a significant role in the observation of evoked responses and the empirical estimation of OM, and that the prominence of amplitude modulation may change. The authors also highlighted the importance of considering factors that may mask a correspondence between the amplitude modulation of oscillations and corresponding baseline shifts.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus that can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with a case fatality rate of up to 40%. It has been endemic in Africa, Asia, and southern Europe, and recently, autochthonous cases have been reported in Spain. The virus can infect various cell types, including mononuclear cells, epithelial cells, and hepatocytes, and the liver is an important target organ for CCHFV. A study using RNA-Seq in two human liver cell lines infected with CCHFV (strain IbAr10200) identified numerous host pathways that were modulated by the virus, including antiviral response and endothelial cell leakage. The genes encoding DDX60, a cytosolic component of the RIG-I signalling pathway, and OAS2 were both shown to be dysregulated. Additionally, PTPRR was induced in Huh7 cells but not HepG2 cells, which has been associated with the TLR9 signalling cascade, and polymorphisms in TLR9 have been associated with poor outcomes in patients. Whole-genome sequencing of CCHFV was also performed to assess viral diversity over time and its relationship to the host response. The study demonstrated that next-generation mRNA deep-sequencing can be used to examine mRNA gene expression and to examine viral quasispecies and typing of the infecting strain, which could have implications for prognosis.
Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder associated with working memory (WM) deficits, considered one of the core behavioral markers. WM dysfunctions in SZ have been linked to impaired perception, attention, problem-solving, and executive control, affecting multiple mental processes. Prior studies have attributed WM deficits in SZ to decreased capacity compared to healthy controls (HC). However, recent research suggests that other components, such as precision, also mediate behavioral performance. A study investigating the performance of 60 SZ and 61 HC in a visual WM task found that a variable precision (VP) model best explained the behavior of both groups. The results indicate that SZ exhibited larger variability in allocating memory resources rather than memory resources or capacity per se. Individual differences in resource allocation variability predicted symptom severity in SZ, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenic pathology. The study provides an alternative view to the decreased-capacity theory and emphasizes the importance of elevated resource allocation variability in generating atypical WM behavior in SZ. The findings also suggest the utility of Bayesian observer models in characterizing mechanisms of mental deficits in clinical neuroscience.
The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is crucial for viral entry and immune evasion, with the gp120 surface subunit being extensively studied. However, the role of the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein in natural infection is less well understood. This study identified an HIV-1 Env variant with a Q563R change in the gp41 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region, which increases viral infectivity in the presence of autologous or heterologous HIV-positive plasma. This phenotype is due to the Q563R change disrupting the formation of the gp41 six-helix bundle required for virus-cell membrane fusion, and can be restored by antibodies that bind cluster I epitopes on gp41. Additionally, the Q563R change increases HIV-1 sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER). Overall, this study highlights the importance of gp41 residues in membrane fusion and the role of host factors in alleviating viral defects.
The COnsensus Molecular SUbtype of Cancer (COMSUC) web server is a newly developed, user-friendly tool for the integration of discrepant cancer clustering results generated by multiple methods and multi-omics data from multiple platforms. It aims to provide powerful support for users' efforts to decipher cancer CMSs and for the development of a consensus classification system integrating different clustering results. COMSUC has two main components: a user interface and computational services. The user interface permits interactive analysis and visualization of results, and was written using the iView framework for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The computational services are provided by the back-end server using the Egg.js framework for Node.js. COMSUC uses R to implement algorithms and MySQL for the storage and management of application data. It integrates eight typical clustering methods implemented using R packages and three consensus clustering algorithms to integrate clustering results generated by different clustering methods and multi-omics data. The Kaplan-Meier method is used to perform survival analysis, and subtype signatures are examined using the “pamr” R package. COMSUC can be accessed with most web browsers and identifies CMSs by three steps: first, it uses eight typical clustering methods to divide samples into clusters; next, it uses one of three consensus clustering methods to integrate these clustering results; and then, it uses the consensus clustering algorithm for further integration of the clustering results based on omics data. Users can choose to analyze one of 35 cancer types, upload their private data, choose one of three public cancer data sources, or do both, and then choose any of five omics data types, any of eight typical clustering methods, or any of three consensus clustering methods. The results can be downloaded and accessed for 30 days using a unique project ID and web link. To our knowledge, COMSUC is the first web server that allows users to perform clustering ensemble studies with multi-omics data, multiple methods, and multiple platforms.
The seabird tick, Ixodes uriae, is widely distributed in the circumpolar regions of both northern and southern hemispheres. It is believed that Ix. uriae spread from the southern to the northern circumpolar region millions of years ago and has remained isolated in these regions since. A study was conducted to determine whether viruses associated with ticks exhibit the same evolutionary patterns as their hosts by collecting Ix. uriae specimens near a Gentoo penguin colony in Antarctica and from migratory birds in northern Sweden. Through meta-transcriptomic next-generation sequencing, 16 RNA viruses were identified, seven of which were novel. The Ronne virus and two closely related species were detected in both hemispheres, indicating at least two cross-circumpolar dispersal events. Migratory birds are responsible for the movement of viruses at both local and global scales. The analysis of genome sequence data from these microorganisms can provide additional information about the evolutionary and epidemiological history of the host species. Ix. uriae is a well-known vector of multiple different viruses and bacteria, including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Gadgets Gully virus. Data from both mitochondrial and nuclear genes suggest that Ix. uriae diverged from its most recent common ancestor approximately 91 million years ago, and was introduced into the northern hemisphere from the likely ancestral Australasian population approximately 10 million years ago. Thereafter, both the southern and northern populations diversified into geographically structured subpopulations with no evidence of dispersal between them. However, some birds can migrate long distances, and it is important to determine whether there has been any recent viral dispersal between the two polar regions and if there is any gene flow between the two Ix. uriae sub-populations.
RecombineX is a Linux-based computational framework designed for automated high-throughput tetrad analysis, which can be installed and configured via a pre-shipped installer script. It has a series of task-specific modules handling different workflow phases: genome and read preparation, parental marker identification, gamete read mapping and genotyping, and tetrad-based recombination event profiling. RecombineX can be executed in two modes: reference-based mode and parent-based mode. The reference-based mode requires a reference genome assembly and the short reads of the two crossing parents, while the parent-based mode requires the native genome assemblies of both crossing parents. Both modes further need short reads of individual gametes. RecombineX identifies high-confident SNVs between the two parental backgrounds and uses them as polymorphic markers segregated between the two parental backgrounds. It computes the best supported genotype at each marker position for each gamete and identifies and classifies recombination events into different categories. RecombineX also supports performing tetrad analysis directly based on the genome assemblies of the two crossing parents, which could be especially valuable for analyzing recombination events in their native parental genome contexts. RecombineX has been tested to identify markers and perform genotyping with high reliability and accuracy, even with low sequencing depth and in the presence of repetitive sequences or copy number variants.
"The APOBEC3 (A3) genes in primates encode cytidine deaminase proteins with antiviral and anti-retroelement activity, characterized by duplication, recombination, and deletion events. Seven A3s are found in primates, three with single deaminase domains (A3A, A3C, and A3H) and four with double deaminase domains (A3B, A3D, A3F, and A3G). The most potent A3 protein against HIV-1 is A3G, but it's unclear if double deaminase domain A3s have a generalized functional advantage against HIV-1. Researchers created synthetic double domain A3s by linking A3C and A3H single domains in novel combinations, finding enhanced antiviral activity comparable to or better than A3G. This increase in antiviral activity is conferred by both cytidine-deaminase dependent and independent mechanisms, with the latter correlating to an increase in RNA binding affinity. A T cell line expressing this A3C-A3H super restriction factor controls replicating HIV-1ΔVif infection to similar levels as A3G. Host-virus ""arms-race"" leads to positive selection in host antiviral genes, with repeated cycles of host resistance and virus adaptation. Antiviral gene family expansion, such as in the APOBEC3 (A3) locus, is an attractive evolutionary strategy to expand host anti-pathogen response. Gene duplication and recombination create antiviral gene families, with neo- or sub-functionalization, as seen in most mammals encoding two paralogs of Mx proteins and TRIM5. The human A3 locus encodes seven A3 paralogs, with rapid evolution suggesting each has evolved to counteract pathogens."
The paper discusses the use of variant allele frequencies (VAF) in cancer evolution and the limitations of existing methods for cancer evolutionary inference using VAF information. The authors propose a new method, TumE, which integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks to infer ongoing selection in bulk-sequenced single tumour biopsies. The method significantly improves both accuracy and inference time per sample when detecting positive selection, deconvoluting selected subclonal populations, and estimating subclone frequency. Transfer learning is used to leverage stored knowledge within TumE models for related evolutionary inference tasks, reducing data and computational time for further model development. The authors also highlight the potential of this extensible framework for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and cancer patients. The paper also provides background on cancer as a disease characterized by unrelenting tissue growth and clonal evolution, and the use of VAF-based methods to infer cancer evolution in bulk-sequenced tumours. Existing VAF-based methods have limitations, such as being maximally compressive, suffering from the curse of dimensionality, and making incorrect assumptions that lead to systematic overestimation in the number of subclonal populations in sequenced tumours. The TumE method aims to address these limitations by generating synthetic VAF distributions as a proxy for evolutionary ground truth from plausible simulations of tumour evolution, and using these to build inference models that accurately classify and quantify evolutionary and subclonal dynamics in real patient tumours while capturing uncertainty in estimates. The method also highlights the power of utilizing deep learning for inference by exploiting stored knowledge via transfer learning. The authors validated their synthetic supervised learning approach in millions of synthetic tumours and applied TumE to 88 copy-number and purity-corrected whole-genome and whole-exome sequenced tumour biopsies. Overall, the paper presents a promising new method for cancer evolutionary inference using VAF information.
This study researched the diversity and distribution of trypanosomes in two areas of Chad, Mandoul and Maro, where Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) are endemic. Tsetse flies transmit the parasites that cause these diseases. In Mandoul, a tsetse control campaign was ongoing, while in Maro, it had not started. The study analyzed 717 human and 540 cattle blood samples and 177 tsetse flies using PCR and amplicon sequencing targeting ITS1 and gGAPDH. Trypanosomal DNA was identified in 14 human samples, 227 cattle samples, and in tsetse. In Maro, T. congolense was detected in humans, and in addition to known animal pathogens, T. godfreyi and T. grayi were detected in cattle and tsetse samples. Furthermore, evidence for additional unknown trypanosomes was obtained in tsetse. In contrast, in the Mandoul area, only T. theileri, T. simiae, and T. vivax DNA was identified in cattle. The study suggests that tsetse control activities in Mandoul reduced the tsetse population and pathogenic parasites, but T. theileri, T. vivax, and T. simiae are still frequent in cattle, indicating transmission by other insect vectors. In Maro, the high diversity and frequency of trypanosomes, including HAT/AAT pathogenic species, may be due to transhumance to/from the Central African Republic and no tsetse control. The study emphasizes the need to enforce monitoring and control campaigns and investigate the infectivity of the unknown trypanosomes regarding their zoonotic potential.
Hybridization between certain Schistosoma species, particularly Schistosoma haematobium and S. bovis, is a common occurrence in Africa and can cause significant public health and veterinary issues. Recent genomic evidence shows that some S. haematobium populations have signatures of genomic introgression from S. bovis. A genomic comparative study was conducted using 19 isolates from a wide geographical range in Africa, including 11 S. haematobium, 6 S. bovis, and 2 S. haematobium x S. bovis hybrids. The study used whole genomic sequencing to develop 56,181 SNPs that allowed a clear differentiation of S. bovis isolates from a genomic cluster including all S. haematobium isolates and a natural S. haematobium-bovis hybrid. All the isolates from the S. haematobium cluster, except the isolate from Madagascar, harbored signatures of genomic introgression from S. bovis. The observed introgression is unidirectional, and the isolates from Corsica, Mali, and Egypt harbored the S. bovis-like Invadolysin gene, an introgressed tract that has been previously detected in some introgressed S. haematobium populations from Niger. These findings highlight the widespread introgression from S. bovis across S. haematobium and the potential impact on the genetic integrity of S. haematobium. Further genomic analyses are required to best characterize S. haematobium populations and unravel the genomic relationships between S. haematobium, S. bovis and their hybrids across all endemic countries.
A potential HIV vaccine using Dimeric IgA (dIgA) has shown promise due to the high concentration of IgA in colorectal tissue, a primary site for HIV transmission. IgA is found primarily in the mucosa as a dimer and has two subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, which differ structurally. IgA plays an important immunological role in preventing further infection by immune exclusion, trapping and excluding the pathogen’s ability to enter underlying tissues. However, most vaccines do not stimulate protective IgA responses. A study in non-human primates (NHP) found that HGN194 dIgA1 provided protection against rectal challenge with SHIV-1157-ipEL-p, while HGN194 dIgA2 only protected 17% of the RMs. Intravenous HGN194 IgG1 given at a low dose provided no protection, but giving both intravenous low-dose HGN194 IgG1 and rectally applied HGN194 dIgA2 treatments afforded 100% protection. To gain insights into the ability of dIgA antibodies to mediate protection from mucosal challenge, a RM model was developed to monitor the distribution and localization of both dIgAs and viral particles under the conditions of the HGN194-dIgA/IgG1 studies. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) coupled with computerized tomography (CT) was used to visualize the radiolabeled molecule at the whole animal level and identify small tissue pieces which contain the labeled molecules of interest. The study found that dIgA antibodies affect viral dissemination and penetration throughout the gut mucosa, potentially through the formation of immune complexes. The results validate the combined PET imaging and fluorescent microscopy methodology as a highly efficient approach for non-invasively tracking HIV and antibodies.
Iliski is a open-source software for computing Transfer Functions (TFs) between two signals, which can be used to model and understand the relationships between complex biological signals. It is designed to handle disparate datasets and includes various pre-treatment routines and TF computation processes such as deconvolution, deterministic and non-deterministic optimization algorithms. Iliski has been applied to data on neurovascular coupling, an ensemble of cellular mechanisms that link neuronal activity to local changes of blood flow, and is available under the open-source license CC BY 4.0 on GitHub. It can be used within the MATLAB environment or as a standalone application on common operating systems.The use of TFs is important in understanding the relationship between two time series, such as predicting the output of complex electrical circuits or other industrial systems. In brain imaging based on blood flow dynamics, TFs are used to lump the multitude of cellular and molecular processes linking neural activation to changes in blood flow. Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is mediated through multiple processes and has often been assessed with deconvolution, but these methods can suffer from sensitivity to noise. Iliski proposes a workflow to help users choose the best computation according to the dataset and aims to improve the estimate of the TF by reducing the noise or using optimization of known functions or a kernel of functions.Iliski was developed to handle multiple component noise in experimental acquisitions, and includes smoothing and median filter functions, as well as options for cutting the input and output signals between two given time points and using a boxcar function of variable duration. The software offers two main types of TF computation: deconvolution or function optimization. The former is straightforward, while the latter requires further settings depending on the chosen algorithm. Iliski allows for loading previously computed results structures, and the results structure can be saved as XLS file, MATLAB formatted binary file format or Matlab workspace.In summary, Iliski is a versatile and open-source software that provides a variety of options for computing TFs between two signals, with a focus on improving the estimate of the TF in the presence of noise and multiple component signals. It has been applied to data on neurovascular coupling, but has potential uses in other fields where computing TFs may be helpful in interpreting results.
The Zika virus, transmitted through Aedes mosquitoes, is prevalent in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific, and can cause mild symptoms such as fever, skin rashes, and joint pain in infected individuals. However, if a mother contracts the virus before or during pregnancy, there is a risk of the child developing Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), which can lead to physical and developmental consequences such as microcephaly, dysphagia, and an increased likelihood of choking. A qualitative evidence synthesis was conducted to inform WHO infant feeding guidelines, focusing on the values and preferences of relevant stakeholders concerning infant (0-2 years) feeding in the presence of CZS and severe disability with nonprogressive, chronic encephalopathies. Six CZS-specific studies and eight indirect studies were included, highlighting the preference for breastfeeding and the challenges faced by mothers who cannot breastfeed, as well as the need for appropriate advice and emotional support from health professionals. While there is no evidence of Zika transmission via breast milk, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed Zika infection should be fed according to normal infant feeding guidelines, including breastfeeding within one hour of birth, exclusive breastfeeding for six months, and continued breastfeeding up to two years of age or beyond. This recommendation is based on the benefits of breastfeeding for both the infant and mother, outweighing any potential risk of Zika virus transmission through breast milk.
The study describes the design and characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. The Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. The nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties, and when compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. The study indicates that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens, but the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined. Recombinant protein immunogens, such as these nanoparticle immunogens, hold great promise against difficult viral and microbial targets for which there are currently no viable vaccine solutions. Engineered ectodomains of the Env glycoprotein are at the core of most present HIV vaccine development efforts, and several recombinant native-like trimers are being evaluated in human clinical trials. While recombinant, native-like trimers represent a breakthrough in HIV vaccine development, identifying the most appropriate way to present them in order to maximize immunogenicity in different formulations is a major challenge that remains to be addressed.
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a DNA virus that infects a wide range of vertebrates and can cause significant economic losses in the swine industry. Recent studies have shown that PRV can also infect humans, causing damage to the nervous and respiratory systems. PRV has a large double-stranded DNA genome that encodes over 70 functional proteins, several of which have been shown to inhibit host innate antiviral responses. One such protein is UL13, which has been identified as a suppressor of STING-mediated signaling and inhibits IFN production and antiviral response during PRV infection. UL13 interacts with STING in the cytosol and impairs STING protein stability, recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 5 (RNF5) to promote K27-/K29-linked ubiquitination and degradation of STING. Knockdown or deficiency of UL13 enhances the protein stability of STING and impairs STING-mediated production of type I IFNs and expression of other downstream antiviral factors. These findings suggest that PRV UL13 functions as an antagonist of IFN signaling via a novel mechanism by targeting STING to persistently evade host antiviral responses. The cGAS-STING axis is critical for host antiviral responses, and viruses, including PRV, have evolved various strategies to antagonize this signaling pathway for immune evasion.
Arthropod-borne viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), require replication across a wide range of temperatures to perpetuate. While vertebrate hosts maintain a constant temperature, arthropods are subject to ambient temperatures with daily fluctuations, impacting vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival. A study on ZIKV and Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures, peaking between 28°C and 32°C for both Aedes species. Transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days for Aedes albopictus. However, fluctuating temperature decreased vector competence. Temperature alters the selective environment within mosquitoes, with constant temperatures more often eliciting positive selection and fluctuating temperatures leading to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species. These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology, including major effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes.
Olfaction is crucial for survival in a natural habitat, and understanding how the nervous system integrates signals from multiple odorants is essential for comprehending olfactory system functions. This study focuses on Caenorhabditis elegans and investigates the circuit basis of olfactory integration when two odorants are present simultaneously. The researchers found that the presence of a repulsive odorant, 2-nonanone, blocks the attraction of other odorants, such as isoamyl alcohol (IAA) or benzaldehyde, that signal food. Genes known to regulate the structure and function of sensory neurons, osm-5 and osm-1, play a critical role in this integration process. Loss of these genes mildly reduces the response to the repellent 2-nonanone and disrupts the integration effect.In complex olfactory environments, odorant sensation regulates behaviors that are critical for survival. While previous studies have characterized how the nervous system detects and responds to individual odorants, this study investigates how the nervous system integrates information from multiple odorants. Using C. elegans, the researchers identified redundant neural circuits that regulate the robust effect of a repulsive odorant to block responses to attractive odorants. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neuronal and cellular basis for complex olfactory tasks.[1] Liu, Q., et al. (2018).

Schistosomiasis, caused by the genus Schistosoma, is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries, affecting 230-250 million people annually and causing approximately 280,000 deaths per year. The current treatment relies solely on praziquantel, but the emergence of parasites with reduced sensitivity and the challenges of re-infection and drug resistance necessitate the development of vaccines. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles released by both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, with promising therapeutic, diagnostic, and immunizing applications. In schistosomiasis, EVs have been shown to have protective roles against different helminthic infections and to contain proteins homologous to the parasitic stage from which they have been derived. Studies on the egg stage of Schistosoma mansoni are limited, but S. japonicum egg-derived EVs have been shown to transfer their cargo to recipient cells, demonstrating their regulatory role in host-parasite interaction.In this study, the researchers evaluated the immunizing approach of EVs derived from S. mansoni eggs against murine schistosomiasis. They found that S. mansoni egg-derived EVs exhibited a rounded morphology with uniform outline and variable sizes, and that vaccination with these EVs induced a significant reduction rate in the total adult worm loads. The reduction in the adult count could be explained by the evident tegumental derangements and the exposure of the underlying antigenic determinants to the host immune cells. The strong immune response directed toward the adult worm could be due to the presence of antigens from different developmental stages of the parasite, including the adult stage, carried by the EVs. The researchers concluded that S. mansoni egg-derived EVs have the potential to be used as a vaccine candidate against murine schistosomiasis. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and schedule for vaccination.
Mycetoma, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease, is caused by fungi or filamentous bacteria and affects the subcutaneous tissue, skin, muscles, and bone. Although it is a neglected tropical disease globally, data on its burden and associated complications in Uganda are limited. A study aimed to estimate the burden of mycetoma in Uganda by reviewing biopsy reports at the Pathology reference laboratory, Makerere University, and published literature on mycetoma in Uganda. The study found that the average incidence of mycetoma in Uganda was 0.32/100,000 persons, and the prevalence was 8.32/100,000 persons per decade. However, there was a general decline in the number of cases detected recently. Males and the age group of 21-30 years were the most affected by mycetoma in Uganda, and only 7% of the cases were children. The foot was the most affected part of the body, and fungi were the most common causative agents (89%). The study concludes that mycetoma is a relatively rare disease in Uganda, mostly caused by fungi, and there is a big gap in data and epidemiological studies. More systematic studies are warranted to define the true burden of mycetoma in Uganda.
Malaysia aimed to eliminate malaria nationwide by 2020, but this goal may need to be extended as human infections by simian malaria parasite, particularly P. knowlesi, remain prevalent, especially in remote areas. Seven full-text English publications from 2008-2021 were reviewed to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium among simian host species in Malaysia. Long-tailed macaques (M. fascicularis) and pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina) are the main simian malaria hosts and reservoirs of five common simian Plasmodium species: P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, P. coatneyi, P. fieldi, and P. inui. The most prevalent Plasmodium in macaques is P. inui, followed by P. knowlesi and P. cynomolgi, while P. fieldi is the least prevalent. Prevalence varies by geographical location and is affected by host genetics, host susceptibility to parasites, differences in vectors, and frequency of sampling. A study in Negeri Sembilan found macaques infected with human Plasmodium species, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae, indicating their potential as reservoirs for human plasmodium. PCR diagnosis methods are more effective than microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests in detecting Plasmodium species, especially at low parasitemia levels. Nested and real-time PCRs are simple, highly specific, and more sensitive than microscopy and RDTs. PCR assays have detected mono, dual, and triple infections in primate hosts in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, and the Philippines. Quintuple infections have also been detected, but their prevalence is relatively low.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human tumor virus that causes approximately 2% of all cancer deaths worldwide. EBV has a typical herpesvirus life cycle consisting of latency and lytic replication. EBNA1 is a key antigen expressed in all EBV-associated tumors during latency and is required for maintenance of the EBV episome DNA and the regulation of viral gene transcription. The mechanism by which EBV maintains latent infection at the posttranslational level is unclear, but a recent study found that EBNA1 contains two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), SIM2 and SIM3. Mutation of SIM2 disrupts EBNA1 dimerization, while SIM3 contributes to the polySUMO2 modification of EBNA1 at lysine 477. The SIM3 motif is required for EBNA1-mediated inhibitory effects on SUMO2-modified STUB1, SUMO2-mediated degradation of USP7, and SUMO1-modified KAP1. Deletion of the EBNA1SIM motif leads to functional loss of both EBNA1-mediated viral episome maintenance and lytic gene silencing. Hypoxic stress induces the SUMO2 modification of EBNA1, which causes the dissociation of EBNA1 with STUB1, KAP1, and USP7, increasing the SUMO1 modification of both STUB1 and KAP1 for reactivation of lytic replication. Therefore, the EBNA1SIM motif is essential for EBV latency and is a potential therapeutic target against EBV-associated cancers.
The gene WAPO-A1, located on chromosome arm 7AL, has been identified as a regulator of grain yield in wheat. It was found to be the causal gene for a previously detected QTL affecting spikelet number per spike, grain number per spike, and grain yield. Loss-of-function mutants of WAPO-A1 and WAPO-B1 showed reduced spikelet number, and transgenic wheat plants with extra copies of WAPO-A1 had higher spikelet number. WAPO-A1 affects spikelet number by regulating the timing of terminal spikelet formation. Additionally, both transgenic and wapo1 mutant plants showed a range of floral abnormalities, indicating additional roles of WAPO1 on wheat floral development. The WAPO-A1 allele in the H1 haplotype, which is associated with reduced spikelet number, has a 115-bp deletion in the promoter and is expressed at significantly lower levels. The H2 haplotype, which is associated with the strongest effects in increasing spikelet and grain number, is already present in most modern common wheat varieties but is rare in durum wheat. Wheat is a crucial staple crop, providing more than 20% of the calories and protein consumed by the human population. However, historical yield trend studies have shown a decrease in the relative rates of grain yield gains in some wheat growing regions. Identifying genes controlling total grain yield is challenging due to its complex quantitative nature and genotype by environment interactions. However, grain yield can be dissected into more discrete yield components with higher heritability. Total grain yield can be partitioned into several yield components, including number of spikes per area unit, spikelet number per spike, grain number per spikelet, and average grain weight. Among these traits, spikelet number per spike usually exhibits high heritability. A highly significant and stable QTL for spikelet number per spike was identified on chromosome arm 7AL in multiple genome-wide association studies. This QTL was further delimited to an 87-kb region containing four candidate genes, with WAPO-A1 being the most promising candidate gene.
Scrub typhus, a vector-borne zoonosis caused by Orientia spp. and transmitted by trombiculid mite larvae, known as chiggers, has been considered endemic to the Asia-Pacific region, particularly within the tsutsugamushi triangle. However, recent cases in the Arabian Peninsula and southern Chile have expanded the known endemic region. In Chile, scrub typhus was discovered on Chiloé Island, where rodents serve as the primary hosts for the trombiculid vector. In this study, rodents were captured in six sites on Chiloé Island, and chiggers were found on all seven rodent species examined, with a 55% prevalence rate. Three genera of trombiculids were identified, with Herpetacarus being the most abundant (93%). Molecular analyses proved that 15.8% of mite pools were positive for Orientia species, all of which belonged to the genus Herpetacarus. This study provides the first report of the presence of rodent-associated chigger mites positive for Orientia sp. in a region endemic for scrub typhus in southern Chile, suggesting that chigger mites serve as vectors and reservoirs of this emerging zoonosis in South America.
"During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya, two other viral diseases with the same vector, were also in circulation. The clinical presentation of these diseases can vary, making it difficult to differentially diagnose them, and it is possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa. A study aimed to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic by generating revised estimates of reported cases of Zika that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation with or without laboratory confirmation. The results showed that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher reported cases of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil. Given that Zika, dengue, and chikungunya appear likely to co-circulate in the Americas and elsewhere for years to come, this methodology has the potential to enhance the interpretation of passive surveillance data for these diseases going forward.The correct diagnosis is important for the veracity of clinical data used in epidemiological analyses. Diagnostic accuracy can depend strongly on the uniqueness of a disease's symptomatology. With symptoms that are common to many diseases, such as malaise, fever, and fatigue, it can be more difficult to ascertain a disease's etiology. Further complicating clinical diagnosis is person-to-person variability in apparent symptoms and their severity. In many cases, symptoms are self-assessed by the patient and communicated verbally to the clinician, introducing subjectivity and resulting in inconsistencies across different patients and clinicians.When they are used, molecular and serological diagnostics are thought to greatly enhance the accuracy of a diagnosis, as they involve less subjectivity and can confirm that a given pathogen is present. However, molecular and serological diagnostics do have limitations, particularly for epidemiological surveillance. As laboratory diagnostics are often not the standard protocol, an infected person first has to present with symptoms in a medical setting and the clinician has to decide to use a laboratory diagnostic. This is particularly unlikely to happen for emerging infectious diseases, as clinicians may not be aware of the pathogen or that it is in circulation. In this context, laboratory diagnostics may also suffer from low sensitivity and specificity, high cost, or unavailability in settings with limited resources. Additionally, serological diagnostics often suffer from cross-reactivity across related viruses, which can lead to uncertainty in identifying the disease-causing pathogen.Retrospective analyses of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in China and the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the United States estimated that many more cases may have been clinically misdiagnosed than were known to surveillance systems. Challenges associated with disease diagnosis are magnified in scenarios with co-circulating pathogens, particularly when the diseases that those pathogens cause are associated with similar symptoms. Influenza and other respiratory pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), co-circulate during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. Similar issues occur in malaria-endemic regions. One study in India found that only 5.7% of commonly diagnosed ""malaria-infected"" individuals actually had this etiology, while 25% had dengue instead.In the context of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, which are transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, some symptoms of the diseases they cause can facilitate differential diagnosis, such as joint swelling and muscle pain with CHIKV infection and a unique rash with ZIKV infection. Other symptoms, such as malaise and fever, could result from infection with any of these viruses. A study in Brazil found that misdiagnosis based on clinical symptoms was common for Zika, with sensitivities (true-positive rate) and specificities (true-negative rate) as low as 0.286 and 0.014, respectively. The substantial errors in clinical diagnosis and the large number of cases lacking a molecular diagnosis leave open the possibility that a considerable number of cases could have been misdiagnosed during the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic. The study aimed to quantify the possible extent of misdiagnosis during the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic by leveraging passive surveillance data for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika from 43 countries in the Americas in conjunction with empirical estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The study used suspected and confirmed case data for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika from PAHO for 43 countries in the Americas and made use of joint probability distributions of sensitivity and specificity, one for clinical diagnostics and two for laboratory diagnostics, informed by empirical estimates. This feature of the analysis allowed for generalization beyond the six specific clinical diagnostic criteria quantified by the study. Using this approach, the study updated estimates of Zika reported cases during its 2015-2017 epidemic across the Americas."
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family, which causes both acute and chronic infections. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) affects over 257 million people worldwide and can lead to severe liver complications. HBV has an enveloped 3.2-kb partially double-stranded relaxed circular (rc) DNA genome that becomes covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the host cell nucleus. cccDNA transcribes five mRNAs, including the 3.5-kb precore (pc) and pregenomic (pg) RNA, 2.4/2.1-kb surface mRNAs, and 0.7-kb X mRNA. HBV replicates its DNA genome via reverse transcription of pgRNA in the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid.In CHB patients, HBV RNA can be detected in virus-like particles in serum and has been used as a biomarker for intrahepatic cccDNA activity in treated patients. However, the biogenesis and molecular characteristics of serum HBV RNA remain unclear. A study found that encapsidated serum HBV RNA predominantly consists of pgRNA, which is detergent- and ribonuclease-resistant. Cell culture supernatant contains a large amount of pgRNA-containing nonenveloped capsids and a minor population of pgRNA-containing virions. pgRNA-virion formation requires both capsid assembly and viral envelope proteins, which can be inhibited by capsid assembly modulators and an envelope-knockout mutant, respectively. pgRNA-virions utilize the multivesicular body pathway for egress, similar to DNA-virion morphogenesis. Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and 3’ RACE assays revealed that serum/supernatant HBV pgRNA are mainly spliced and devoid of the 3’-terminal sequences. pgRNA-virions collected from cells treated with a reversible HBV priming inhibitor L-FMAU were unable to establish infection in HepG2-NTCP cells.In summary, serum HBV RNA is secreted in noninfectious virion-like particles as spliced and poly (A)-free pgRNA. Understanding the molecular biology of serum HBV RNA in the HBV life cycle can aid the development of serum HBV RNA as a novel biomarker for CHB diagnosis and treatment prognosis. Nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs) are prescribed for CHB, which suppress HBV replication, improve long-term outcomes, and reduce liver cancer risks. However, HBV infection cannot be completely eliminated due to the paucity of direct antiviral effect of NAs on cccDNA. HBV RNAs, especially pgRNA, may be a potential new marker for monitoring cccDNA activity in CHB. Recent studies have reported that serum HBV RNA level was associated with responses to pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) or NAs, and may guide the discontinuation of NA-therapy. However, the nature of serum HBV RNA remains elusive, and a standardized detection method is warranted. Extracellular HBV RNA contains pgRNA and spliced RNA variants in the supernatant of HBV-infected cell cultures and in CHB patient serum, and serum HBV RNA species have heterogeneous lengths. HBV pgRNA-containing virion-like-particles (VLPs) exist in culture fluids and patient sera, which are assembled intracellularly through pgRNA encapsidation and envelopment and secreted via the MVB secretory route. Virion-derived HBV RNAs are predominantly spliced pgRNA devoid of the 3’-terminal sequences, and HBV RNA virions are unable to initiate a new round of infection in cell cultures. These findings provide new insights into a better understanding of serum HBV RNA biology and the further clinical applications of serum HBV RNA as a biomarker for persistent HBV infection.
Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a major public health concern, exacerbated by the emergence of drug-resistant TB. To combat the host’s dynamic environment, Mtb encodes multiple DNA repair enzymes, including uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) that play a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity. Mtb possesses a GC-rich genome, making it highly susceptible to cytosine deaminations, resulting in the occurrence of uracils in the DNA. UDGs encoded by ung and udgB initiate the repair; hence, the biological impact of deleting UDGs in the adaptation of pathogen was investigated. Gene replacement mutants of uracil DNA glycosylases, individually (RvΔung, RvΔudgB) or together (RvΔdKO), were generated. The double KO mutant, RvΔdKO exhibited remarkably higher spontaneous mutation rate, in the presence of antibiotics, and showed higher survival rates in guinea pigs and accumulated large numbers of SNPs as revealed by whole-genome sequence analysis. Competition assays revealed the superior fitness of RvΔdKO over Rv, both in ex vivo and in vivo conditions. This study suggests that compromised DNA repair results in the accumulation of mutations, and a subset of these drives adaptation in the host, allowing for the facile identification of drug targets.
"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the biological master clock, is composed of approximately 10,000 clock cells that are heterogeneous in their circadian periods. Despite this inhomogeneity, an intact SCN maintains a high degree of circadian phase coherence due to various cell-to-cell coupling mechanisms, including action potential (AP)-mediated connectivity, which is essential. However, limited information is available about the morphology of this connectivity at a cellular scale. To address this, researchers explored a large pool of network morphologies and identified several plausible features of SCN networks. These features include a positive correlation between ""indegree"" and ""outdegree,"" a higher total degree of cells in the ventrolateral region (core) than in the dorsal medial region (shell), approximately 7.5 times more intra-core edges than intra-shell edges, and a distance probability density function for the afferent connections that fits well to a beta function. These features are expected to be useful for future explorations of the AP-mediated clock cell connectome within the SCN.The authors then conducted a massive set of numerical computations with various network morphologies, using a personal computer with specific parameters. They determined the suitability of model network morphologies by evaluating the properties of the resulting phase waves. After reducing the archive of network morphologies, they found that the chosen morphologies had two properties: a positive correlation between ""indegree"" and ""outdegree"" and significantly more edges for nodes in the core than in the shell.The study also discussed the SCN clock cells' two coupling mechanisms: local diffusive coupling among adjacent cells and potentially far-reaching, extensive AP-mediated coupling. The authors estimated the strength D of the diffusive coupling but faced challenges in determining the strength K of the AP-mediated cell-to-cell coupling. They conducted an exhaustive scan of K values and network morphologies and found a suitable value of K and network morphologies that supported circadian phase waves consistent with real SCN phase waves.In summary, this study identified plausible network features of SCN networks, including a positive correlation between ""indegree"" and ""outdegree,"" more edges for nodes in the core than in the shell, and a specific distance probability density function for the afferent connections. The findings provide valuable insights and guidance for future experimental explorations on the AP-mediated clock cell network morphology within the SCN."
The left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lvOT) plays a crucial role in reading, and the Lexical Categorization Model (LCM) aims to characterize its functional role in a quantitatively explicit and testable manner. The LCM assumes that the lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access to familiar words and filtering out orthographic strings without meaning. The LCM has been successful in simulating benchmark results from functional brain imaging and predicting lvOT activation better than alternative models. The LCM involves word-likeness as input into a lexical categorization process, with word-likeness represented posteriorly to lvOT and a dichotomous word/non-word output localized to downstream frontal brain regions. Training the process of lexical categorization results in more efficient reading. Therefore, word recognition in the ventral visual stream involves word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization before one can access word meaning. The LCM has been implemented using word-likeness distributions, with real words characterized by high word-likeness and consonant strings differing strongly from existing words. The LCM captures the pattern of lexical categorization difficulty using the information-theoretical concept of entropy. The LCM has been tested against alternative neurocognitive models and a dual-route model, with the LCM and the IA model being the only ones that could simulate all nine contrasts of interest correctly. The LCM has also been found to capture empirically measured BOLD activity in lvOT, and training the lexical categorization process has been shown to increase reading speed, supporting the LCM's assumption of lexical categorization as a core process of visual word recognition.
The circadian clock, an internal biological clock present in most organisms, plays a significant role in the immune system. Disruptions in circadian rhythms have been linked to inflammatory pathologies, particularly in shift workers whose irregular work schedules can cause serious health problems due to alterations in genetic expressions of clock genes. A mathematical model was constructed to better understand the mechanisms that explain the weakened immune system in shift workers. The model, which reproduces clock gene expression in the lung and the immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), predicts that a host is more sensitive to LPS at specific circadian times due to dynamic changes in Interleukin 10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The model identifies REV-ERB as a key modulator of IL-10 activity throughout the circadian day and predicts exaggerated responses to LPS at certain circadian times in both males and females, with females producing fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines than males. This model can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how shift work-mediated circadian disruptions affect inflammatory and other physiological responses.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces a significant risk of introducing vector-borne tropical diseases, such as dengue fever virus (DENV) infection, due to rapid urbanization, global trade, and a large number of worldwide visitors during Hajj and Umrah. This study estimated the DENV infection cost of illness (COI) in Saudi Arabia from 2013-2017 by processing national data, including all declared cases recorded in referral centers in the western region. The direct costs, due to care-related expenditures, were estimated using a statistically validated predictive model, while indirect costs, due to productivity loss, were estimated using the human capital model based on gross domestic product adjusted for invalidity duration. The study found that the total DENV COI for the five years was estimated as US$551.0 Million for a total 15,369 patients, resulting in an average cost of US$11,947.6 by patient. Productivity years loss costs accounted for 63.3% to 83.8% of the estimated total costs. The study highlights the urgent need for an effective national prevention strategy to perform considerable cost-savings besides reducing morbidity. Dengue has a substantial local economic burden that costs US$110.2 Million per year, and the global incidence of DENV infection has evidenced a dramatic increase in the recent two decades with approximately 9,000 deaths reported annually. The economic implication of the disease has been only recently acknowledged, and many methodological techniques can be used to investigate disease costs, including cost consequence analysis (CCA), cost minimization analysis (CMA), and COI analysis. COI studies evaluate the direct and/or indirect costs of a disease or its risk factors, providing plausible and efficacious analysis in the case of dengue.
Nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) occur in multiple cells and tissues, including human patients with fatty liver disease, and are associated with damage in the intestine but not in germ nuclei of C. elegans. The genetic analysis of three mutants with abnormally large or abundant nuclear lipid droplets revealed that the genes encode the lipid regulator SEIP-1/seipin, the inner nuclear membrane protein NEMP-1/Nemp1/TMEM194A, and a component of COPI vesicles called COPA-1/α-COP. The nuclear lipid droplet phenotype of copa-1 mutants results from a defect in retrieving mislocalized membrane proteins that normally reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. Lipid droplets are the major form of fat storage and provide energy and building blocks for membrane growth and repair, and can have additional functions in cell signaling, development, and stress responses. Excess lipid accumulation is associated with a wide range of human pathologies. Lipids accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and bud into the cytoplasm as a small lipid droplet, with homooligomers of the protein seipin appearing to function in stabilizing the lipid lens and in trafficking protein/lipid into the developing LD. Loss-of-function mutations in human seipin cause BSCL type 2, one of the most severe lipodystrophies. COPI components have a role in LD morphology, protein composition, and lipolysis, with ER-localized enzymes involved in triglyceride synthesis appearing to remain anchored in the phospholipid monolayer of the LD surface after budding. nLDs have the potential to impact chromatin organization or the integrity of the lamina, and can serve as storage sites for histones in Drosophila embryos and can contain polyubiquitinated proteins in yeast cells that experience acute lipid stress.
Bacterial meningitis, caused primarily by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), results in high mortality rates and neurological sequelae in survivors, likely due to neuronal damage. Pneumococci interact with the cytoskeleton protein β-actin in human primary neurons through the pilus-1 adhesin RrgA and the cytotoxin pneumolysin (Ply), promoting adhesion, invasion, and neuronal death. Ply binds to the neuronal plasma membrane, increasing β-actin exposure and RrgA binding sites, leading to higher pneumococcal interactions with neurons. Neuronal death caused by pneumococcal infection is potentially due to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, actin cytoskeleton disassembly, and β-actin filament disruption. This data elucidates possible mechanisms for pneumococci-induced neurological sequelae.
The fighting fish Betta splendens is known for its aggressive behavior, making it a popular subject for studying the biological mechanisms of aggression. In a study of male B. splendens, researchers examined the behavioral and brain-transcriptomic changes that occur during a fight between two opponents. They found that the behaviors of the two opponents became synchronized, with each pair showing a unique behavioral pattern. At the physiological level, the researchers examined the expression patterns of 23,306 brain transcripts using RNA-sequencing data from brains of fighting pairs after a 20-minute (D20) and a 60-minute (D60) fight. They found that the two opponents in each D60 fighting pair showed a strong gene expression correlation, whereas those in D20 fighting pairs showed a weak correlation. Each fighting pair in the D60 group showed pair-specific gene expression patterns, indicating a phenomenon called pair-specific individualization in brain-transcriptomic synchronization (PIBS). An analysis of the synchronized genes in fighting pairs of the D60 group found genes enriched for ion transport, synaptic function, and learning and memory. Brain-transcriptomic synchronization could be a general phenomenon and may provide a new cornerstone for investigating coordinating and sustaining social interactions between two interacting partners of vertebrates.
The Omono River virus (OmRV) is a totivirus-like virus that primarily infects mosquitoes, and recent studies have identified a new strain of OmRV with an unexpected protrusion at the five-fold vertex of its capsid. This protrusion is formed by the N-terminal 126 residues of P3 and is associated with the extracellular transmission of the virus. The presence of the protrusion distinguishes the new OmRV strain from the previously reported OmRV-AK4 strain. The anti-P3N126 antibody, which targets the N-terminal 126-aa fragment of P3, reduces the infectivity of OmRV-LZ to C6/36 cells, suggesting that the antibody might block the attachment of the protrusion to the receptor or sterically obstruct the virus from approaching the cell surface. Extracellular transmission requires the ability to recognize, bind, and enter a cell, and the protrusion is the outermost capsid of the OmRV-LZ, making it the first part attached to the cell during invasion. This finding is consistent with the findings in IMNV, which anchors the fibre-like protrusion on its capsid. Other members of the fungus and protozoan virus family Totiviridae, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A, Helminthosporium victoriae virus 190S, Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1, Giardia lamblia virus, and Leishmania RNA viruses 1, lack a fibre-like protrusion on their capsid. The new OmRV strain and its protrusion provide insights into the extracellular transmission of totivirus-like viruses and their interactions with host cells.
The mTOR protein kinase is involved in various crucial cellular processes and exists in two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, with different functions. While mTORC1 is well-characterized and regulates cell growth, metabolism, and protein synthesis, mTORC2 is implicated in cytoskeletal organization, cell survival, and migration. A study found that mTORC2 activity is reduced in mice with a hypomorphic mutation of the Ric-8B gene. Ric-8B is a highly conserved protein that acts as a non-canonical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for heterotrimeric Gαs/olf type subunits. Ric-8B hypomorph embryos are smaller, fail to close the neural tube in the cephalic region, and die during mid-embryogenesis. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that signaling pathways involving GPCRs and G proteins are dysregulated in the Ric-8B mutant embryos, and there is an unexpected impairment of the mTOR signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 is downregulated in the Ric-8B mutant embryos, indicating decreased mTORC2 activity. Knockdown of the endogenous Ric-8B gene in cultured cell lines leads to reduced phosphorylation levels of Akt (Ser473), further supporting the involvement of Ric-8B in mTORC2 activity. These results reveal a crucial role for Ric-8B in development and provide novel insights into the signals that regulate mTORC2.
A novel ensemble forecast system to predict dengue fever spread dynamics has been developed, using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type of compartmental model combined with a data assimilation method called the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (EAKF). This system generates real-time forecasts of dengue fever spread dynamics, informed by meteorological and mosquito density information. The effective population size parameter is updated sequentially to adjust the predicted outbreak scale, based on the most recent observations and historical records. The model outperformed a generalized additive model approach in projecting peak timing, peak intensity, and total incidence of dengue outbreaks in Guangzhou, China, during the 2011-2017 seasons. Dengue fever is a significant public health concern, with over 390 million people infected annually. The Guangdong province in China is highly affected, with Guangzhou city accounting for 76% of cases. The intensity of dengue fever outbreaks varies significantly among different seasons and is challenging to predict due to factors such as population susceptibility, mosquito density, meteorological conditions, geographical factors, and human mobility. The ensemble forecast system can be operated in real-time and inform control planning to reduce the burden of dengue fever.
The study aimed to develop and pilot an intervention to strengthen individual and family resilience against leprosy-related discrimination using a quasi-experimental, before-after study design with a mixed methods approach. The 10-week family-based intervention was designed to strengthen the resilience of individuals and families by enhancing their protective abilities and capacity to overcome adversity. The study was conducted in two sites, urban areas in Telangana state and rural areas in Odisha state, India. Eighty participants across 20 families were included in the study. The intervention was found to significantly increase resilience and quality of life for persons affected and family members in Odisha state, with improvements maintained at six-month follow-up. However, there was no increase in resilience scores post-intervention among participants from Telangana state. Participants especially appreciated the social dimensions of the intervention. The pilot study showed that the 10-week family-based intervention to strengthen resilience among persons affected by leprosy and their family members was feasible and has the potential to improve resilience and quality of life. A large-scale efficacy trial is necessary to determine the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of the intervention.
Shugoshin (Sgo1) is a conserved protein in budding yeast that plays an essential role in correct biorientation of sister chromatids during mitosis. This is achieved by recruiting the protein phosphatase PP2A-Rts1 and the condensin complex to centromeres through a Serine-Rich Motif (SRM) in Sgo1. The interaction between Sgo1 and condensin is regulated by phosphorylation within the SRM, and Mps1, a central kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates Sgo1 within the SRM to regulate its interaction with condensin and localization to centromeres. These findings identify novel mechanisms that control shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast, and have implications for our understanding of proper chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cells.
The identification of T cell epitopes is crucial in various immunological applications such as vaccine design, cancer neoantigen identification, development of diagnostics, and removal of unwanted immune responses against protein therapeutics. Computational T cell epitope prediction tools can help reduce the time and resources needed for epitope identification by narrowing down the peptide repertoire that needs to be experimentally tested. Most of these tools are based on machine learning algorithms trained on MHC binding or naturally processed MHC ligand elution data. However, the ability of these tools to predict T cell epitopes has not been comprehensively evaluated.A study used a recently published dataset that systematically defined T cell epitopes recognized in vaccinia virus (VACV) infected C57BL/6 mice to evaluate the performance of all currently publicly available computational T cell epitope prediction tools. The study found that all methods were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data. These methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top predictions.The study provides guidance for immunologists as to which prediction methods to use and what success rates are possible for epitope predictions when considering a highly controlled system of administered immunizations to inbred mice. The benchmark was implemented in an open and easy to reproduce format, providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools.T cell epitope identification is important in many immunological applications including development of vaccines and diagnostics in infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, removal of unwanted immune responses against protein therapeutics and in cancer immunotherapy. Computational T cell epitope prediction tools can help to reduce the time and resources needed for epitope identification projects by narrowing down the peptide repertoire that needs to be experimentally tested. The study found that neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data had the best performance in identifying T cell epitopes. The study provides a benchmark for developers to compare new tools against, allowing users to make informed decisions on which methods to choose and helping developers understand what changes can truly improve prediction performance.
Epidemiological research suggests that paternal obesity may increase the risk of fathering small for gestational age offspring, potentially mediated by DNA methylation changes in spermatozoa influencing offspring development in utero. Studies have shown that human obesity is associated with differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood, but it is unclear if this differential methylation is reflected in spermatozoa. A study using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array to profile genome-wide DNA methylation in matched human blood and sperm from lean and obese males found that DNA methylation signatures of human blood and spermatozoa are highly discordant, and methylation levels are correlated at only a minority of CpG sites (~1%). Obesity-associated DNA methylation in blood was not generally reflected in spermatozoa, and obesity was not associated with altered covariation patterns or accelerated epigenetic aging in the two tissues. However, one cross-tissue obesity-specific hypermethylated site was identified, warranting replication and further investigation. Spermatozoa displayed differential DNA methylation across pathways enriched in transcriptional regulation compared to matched peripheral blood. Overall, human sperm displays a unique DNA methylation profile that is highly discordant to, and practically uncorrelated with, that of matched peripheral blood. These findings suggest that spermatozoal DNA methylation is an unlikely mediator of intergenerational effects of metabolic traits, and that further research is needed to understand the relationship between obesity and spermatozoal DNA methylation.
Reovirus, a non-enveloped virus with a double-stranded RNA genome, exhibits serotype-dependent patterns of dissemination and tissue tropism within the central nervous system (CNS). While reovirus rarely causes serious disease in humans, it can lead to loss of oral tolerance to dietary antigens. The σ1 attachment protein of reovirus determines cell-entry mediated by σ1 and dictates reovirus neurotropism. Mechanisms of reovirus entry into transformed and non-polarized cells have been characterized, but much of the cell biology of reovirus infection in neurons remains poorly defined. Following internalization at nerve termini, reovirus can move through neural routes to reach distal sites of replication in the CNS. The study of reovirus neuronal entry and transport is important for understanding the early steps of infection and the development of interventions that block these steps.In this study, the researchers used primary rat cortical and sensory neuron cultures in combination with microfluidic devices and small molecule inhibitors of endocytosis to determine mechanisms of reovirus neuronal entry and transport. They discovered that reovirus endocytosis in neurons differs from that in other cell types in the use of macropinocytosis as opposed to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Using microfluidic devices to study directional transport of the virus, they found that reovirus spreads retrograde but not anterograde in cultured neurons. Reovirus axonal transport occurs primarily in non-acidic vesicles and these vesicles acidify after reaching the soma to allow virion disassembly and entry into the cytoplasm. These results provide comprehensive insights into neuron-specific mechanisms used by reovirus for entry and establish the basis for further exploration of common host factors co-opted by pathogens for neural invasion.In vitro systems were established using primary neurons from embryonic rats, cortical neurons (CNs) and dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs), to represent neuronal tissue infected by reovirus in the central and peripheral nervous system, respectively. Reovirus strains T1L and T3SA+ were chosen to represent the two serotypes with differing CNS tropisms. T1L infected CNs poorly when compared with T3SA+, while both strains infected DRGNs comparably. These results indicate that, of the strains tested, T3SA+ maximally infects both neuron types used in this study.To investigate directional transport of reovirus in neurons, the researchers used microfluidic devices that allow isolation and differential treatments of neuronal soma and axons. These devices consist of two compartments connected by thin, micron-sized grooves. While titers in the inoculated compartment increased over time, no titer was detected in the opposing compartment, thus demonstrating efficient fluidic isolation of the compartments. Reovirus was capable of retrograde spread but spreads inefficiently in the anterograde direction. Most neurons in the somal compartment were infected, indicating that the limited spread is not due to the absence of entry or infection of soma.In summary, reovirus efficiently spreads retrograde in DRGNs but spreads inefficiently in the anterograde direction. Reovirus transport in neurons is dependent on microtubules and mediated by dynein. The initial steps in reovirus entry mediated by σ1 dictate the capacity of reovirus to infect specific neuron types. Multiple regulatory factors coordinate retrograde axonal transport of cargo, and reovirus relies on these factors for transport. Molecular factors required for reovirus neuronal transport are present at a steady state and need not be newly synthesized. These findings provide insights into neuron-specific mechanisms used by reovirus for entry and transport and establish the basis for further exploration of common host factors co-opted by pathogens for neural invasion.
The fight against malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, requires durable and potent vaccine responses. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is the only one that has shown significant reduction of clinical and severe malaria in endemic cohorts in Phase 3 trials, although its efficacy declines over time, correlating with the decline in antibody responses to the Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). While most attention has been given to antibodies targeting repeat motifs on PfCSP, this study focuses on seven monoclonal antibodies targeting the C-terminal domain of CSP (ctCSP) from volunteers immunized with RTS,S/AS01. These antibodies target two different sites on opposite faces of ctCSP: a polymorphic region (α-ctCSP) and a previously undescribed site on the conserved β-sheet face of the ctCSP (β-ctCSP). Antibodies to the β-ctCSP site showed broad reactivity with a diverse panel of ctCSP peptides from field isolates of P. falciparum, while those targeting the α-ctCSP site showed limited cross-reactivity. An antibody to the β-site demonstrated inhibition activity against malaria infection in a murine model. This study highlights the potential of targeting the β-site on CSP for prophylactic antibodies and structure-based vaccine design.Malaria continues to be a major global health concern with 229 million cases and 409,000 deaths in 2019. Increased resistance to antimalarial drugs, such as artemisinin, has heightened the need for an effective vaccine. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, recently approved by WHO for use in children in Africa, has shown an efficacy of approximately 50% within the first 14 months of administration. However, its efficacy decreases over time due to waning titers of anti-CSP antibodies. A related vaccine candidate, R21, has shown efficacy levels of 74% and 77% in a 12-month follow-up period following dose 3.PfCSP has multiple domains, including the N-terminal domain, central NANP repeat region, and ctCSP, which is largely composed of an α-thrombospondin repeat (αTSR) domain. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the central repeat region and to the junctional region have been shown to provide a protective effect in a mouse model of malarial disease. Vaccine immunogenicity studies have shown the NANP repeat region to be the immunodominant B-cell epitope. Despite this immunodominance, C-terminal antibodies can also be elicited and have been associated with vaccine efficacy in humans. Given the partial efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine, full understanding of the spectrum of epitopes in the CSP antigens that are recognized by protective antibodies and the role they play in protection may contribute to the design of improved next-generation PfCSP vaccines.
Toxoplasma gondii, a highly prevalent intracellular parasite in humans and animals, is divided into three main genetic lineages (types I, II, and III) that differ in virulence. This study aimed to understand the role of lysine malonylation, a post-translational modification, in the variation of virulence between T. gondii strains. The researchers profiled lysine malonylation in three T. gondii strains (RH, PRU, and VEG) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immuno-affinity purification. They identified differentially malonylated proteins and sites in each strain comparison: RH vs PRU, RH vs VEG, and VEG vs PRU. These differentially malonylated proteins were involved in key processes such as protein metabolism regulation, stress response, glycolysis, and actin cytoskeleton. The results suggest an association between lysine malonylation and intra-species virulence differences in T. gondii and provide a new resource for elucidating the contribution of lysine malonylation to energy metabolism and virulence in T. gondii.
Nematode parasites infect around 1.5 billion people globally, causing significant public health concerns and a need for new anthelmintic drugs. Current anthelmintics target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on parasite nerve and somatic muscle, or glutamate-gated chloride channels in the nematode pharynx. This study identifies a novel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the nematode pharynx, composed of five non-α EAT-2 subunits, not sensitive to existing cholinomimetic anthelmintics. A novel auxiliary subunit protein, EAT-18, is essential for functional expression of this receptor. Nematodes have a greater number of nAChR subunits than vertebrates, and variation in stoichiometry and subunit composition leads to diverse pharmacological sensitivities, making them attractive anthelmintic targets. Nematode nAChRs are regulated by ancillary proteins for correct folding, assembly, and trafficking. Auxiliary proteins interact directly with receptor subunits to modulate channel properties, contributing to the biological and pharmacological diversity of nAChR subtypes. The study characterizes a novel non-α subunit (EAT-2) forming a homomeric ligand-gated cation selective ion-channel, and EAT-18 functioning as an obligate auxiliary protein. The pharmacology of the Cel-EAT-2 receptor is distinct from previously characterized nematode and vertebrate nAChRs. The presence of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the pharynx of the parasitic worm Ascaris suum is confirmed, with significant pharmacological differences from the Cel-EAT-2 ion channel. This research highlights the importance of identifying and establishing the presence and pharmacology of nAChRs in the pharynx of parasitic worms for potential anthelmintic drug targets.
HIV-1 infects CD4 T lymphocytes (CD4TL) through binding the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, with CXCR4-using viruses being more pathogenic and linked to accelerated depletion of CD4TL and progression to AIDS. However, not all CXCR4-using viruses are highly pathogenic, indicating heterogeneity in their virulence. The study investigated the role of the CXCR4 chemokine CXCL12 as a driving force behind virus virulence. In vitro, CXCL12 prevents HIV-1 from binding CXCR4 and entering CD4TL. The study analyzed envelope glycoproteins (Envs) from patients at different stages of infection and found that Envs resistant to CXCL12 are frequent in patients experiencing low CD4TL levels, most often late in infection. These RES Envs adopt a more closed conformation with distinct antigenicity, compared to CXCL12-sensitive (SENS) Envs. The resistance is not due to improved fusion or binding to CD4 but owes to viruses using particular CXCR4 molecules weakly accessible to CXCL12. The low CD4TL levels in patients are related to increased pathogenicity of RES viruses, providing an enhanced capacity to enter naive CD4TL when surrounded by CXCL12 and to deplete bystander activated effector memory cells. Therefore, RES viruses seem more likely to deregulate CD4TL homeostasis. This work improves our understanding of the pathophysiology and the transmission of HIV-1 and suggests that RES viruses’ receptors could represent new therapeutic targets to help prevent CD4TL depletion in HIV+ patients on cART.
Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is endemic in Palestine and is transmitted by Phlebotomus sand flies, which inhabit hyrax dens. Control measures have been implemented since 1996, but cases still occur. A study was conducted from July-September 2019 to estimate the effect of insecticide thermal fogging inside hyrax dens on sand fly density and Leishmania infection. The study found that fogging reduced sand fly abundance and Leishmania infection during the 5-week post-intervention period and especially the first two weeks, suggesting it could be an effective source-reduction measure for ZCL vectors. However, future randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of fogging hyrax dens on decreasing ZCL incidence. Previous studies in Palestine have reported varying results on the effectiveness of insecticides in controlling sand flies. Despite measures such as biannual indoor and outdoor residual insecticide spraying campaigns, CL cases continue to be reported in Palestine. The World Health Organization recommends the fogging of hyrax habitats as a method for sand fly vector control. A study was conducted in Tayasir, Tubas district, Palestine to examine the effectiveness of thermal fogging with pyrethroids in rock hyrax dens to reducing sand fly density and Leishmania spp. infection. The study found that the application of insecticide thermal fogging inside hyrax dens reduced Leishmania vectors at the “source of infection” during the whole post-intervention period and especially in the first two weeks. Phlebotomus sergenti and other Phlebotomus spp. vectors of Leishmania spp. were abundant inside hyrax dens and collected more sand flies from caves than rock-piles. Ten Phlebotomus species were identified, including P. arabicus, a CL vector found for the first time in Palestine. The most abundant species were P. sergenti, P. major s. l., and P. tobbi. Collected sand fly vectors were infected with L. tropica and L. major, with L. tropica being the most frequently carried by P. sergenti. The proportion of P. sergenti that was infected with L. tropica in the pre-intervention phase in the intervention site was higher than that reported in previous studies. Thermal fogging inside the hyrax dens significantly decreased the density of all sand flies and especially of Leishmania infected P. sergenti and P. major. Thermal fogging has a short-lived or no residual effect, and its targeted application at the beginning of the sand fly season followed by two to five weeks application cycles could decrease the sand fly density and the Leishmania infected vectors as the season progresses.
The non-coding regions of viral RNA (vRNA) genomes are crucial in regulating gene expression, with pseudoknot (PK) structures playing varied roles. The 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) vRNA is longer than other picornaviruses and contains multiple putative PKs. While the roles of PKs in FMDV infection are not fully understood, studies show that replicons lacking PKs can still replicate, albeit at reduced levels. Replicons with less than two PKs are outcompeted by those with four PKs, suggesting a replicative advantage. Viruses lacking PKs are not viable, indicating their role in virion assembly. This research enhances understanding of FMDV replication and PKs' roles in RNA functions. FMDV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with seven antigenically diverse serotypes causing foot-and-mouth disease in cloven-hooved animals. Inactivated virus vaccines are often strain-specific and provide little cross-protection. The FMDV genome has a single open reading frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ UTRs and a poly A tail. The 5′ UTR, covalently linked to a small protein primer, contains a single large stem-loop (S-fragment), a poly-C tract, PKs, the cis-acting replication element (cre), and the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The S-fragment, poly-C tract, and PKs' roles in viral replication are not fully elucidated. Truncations to the S-fragment can affect the ability to control aspects of innate immune response to viral infection, and viruses with a deletion within the PK region exhibited an attenuated phenotype. The PKs were computationally predicted in 1987 and are speculated to be formed by duplication events during viral replication. Between two and four PKs are predicted in different virus isolates, with no strain identified with less than two PKs. The presence of PKs has been reported in the 5′ UTR of only two other picornaviruses, encephalomyocarditis virus and equine rhinitis A virus, but in both cases, the PKs are located at the 5′ side of the poly-C-tract, unlike FMDV. PKs have been reported to have roles in several aspects of viral replication in other viruses, including RNA splicing, ribosomal frameshifting, and RNase protection. This study investigates the conserved RNA structure of FMDV PKs and their role in the FMDV life cycle.
This study assessed the palatability of two new orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulations of Praziquantel (PZQ), a drug used to treat Schistosomiasis, in children aged 6-11 years old in Tanzania. The study was conducted as a randomized, single-blind, crossover, swill-and-spit palatability assessment and included 48 children who were stratified according to age group and gender. Children assessed the palatability of Levo-Praziquantel (L-PZQ) ODT 150 mg and Racemate Praziquantel (Rac-PZQ) ODT 150 mg disintegrated in the mouth without water on the first day, and L-PZQ and Rac-PZQ dispersed in water and the currently available PZQ 600 mg formulation (PZQ-Cesol) crushed and dispersed in water on the second day. The palatability of each formulation was rated using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) incorporating a 5-point hedonic scale. The study found that both ODT formulations were more palatable than the existing standard formulation (PZQ-Cesol) and there may be gender and age effects on the assessment of palatability. Further research is needed for assessing efficacy and tolerability of the newly ODTs Praziquantel drug in younger children. Schistosomiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality annually in endemic countries, with younger children being particularly vulnerable to its negative impacts on growth and development. PZQ is the only currently available anti-schistosome drug that is recommended for the species of schistosome that infects humans, but its bitter taste and large tablet size make treatment compliance in children difficult. The development of a paediatric-friendly PZQ formulation that is not bitter to taste will increase the uptake of medication among young-age populations and help to improve treatment in routine care settings and enable the inclusion of preschoolers in mass drug administration campaigns.
"The text discusses the discovery of a novel mechanism of action (MOA) and specific compounds to treat all herpesviruses, both human and animal, which addresses the challenge of drug resistance. The MOA targets the pressurized genome state in a viral capsid, ""turning off"" capsid pressure and blocking viral genome ejection into a cell nucleus, preventing viral replication. This new antiviral target is expected to be impervious to developing drug resistance. The research serves as a proof-of-concept for a new class of broad-spectrum treatments for herpesviruses and other viral infections with genome-pressure-dependent replication. The approach is also crucial for preventing the spread of emerging viruses where vaccine development is challenged by high mutation rates or other evasion mechanisms."
The Nancowry Islands in the Nicobar district of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, are the only inhabited islands by humans with a population of 7674 where the diurnally sub-periodic Wuchereria bancrofti (DspWB) is transmitted by Aedes niveus (Ludlow). Despite nine rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) with DEC and albendazole, the Microfilaria (Mf) prevalence remained above 1%. Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) was conducted to identify appropriate vector sampling methods and assess the impact of MDA. Three trapping devices, Biogents Sentinel traps, gravid traps, and human baited double bed net traps, were used to collect Aedes niveus female mosquitoes. However, daytime man landing collections (MLC) were found to be the most productive method for sampling Ae. niveus mosquitoes. From 151 MLCs, 2170 Ae. niveus female mosquitoes were collected, with an average prevalence of W. bancrofti DNA of 0.43%. The estimated upper 95% CI exceeded the provisional prevalence threshold of 0.1% in all the villages, indicating continued transmission. MX can be used to evaluate interventions in this area after further standardization of the protocol. Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is endemic in 72 countries, with W. bancrofti being the predominant parasite. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000 and has made significant progress in reducing infection and disease. Transmission control with MDA and alleviation of sufferings of the diseased with morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP) are the recommended strategies for achieving the goal of LF elimination. Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) is the recommended protocol to evaluate the impact of the programme and take a decision on stopping the intervention. MX has been demonstrated to be a potential surveillance tool to supplement TAS for different parasite and vector combinations. In India, which contributes around 44.3% of the global burden, the National programme to eliminate LF was launched in 2004 in 256 endemic districts in 21 States and Union Territories. The main strategy is the administration of MDA with DEC and albendazole simultaneously, with an integrated vector management wherever feasible. In the Nancowry Islands, nine rounds of MDA were completed, but even after that, the microfilaria prevalence remained above the transmission threshold level. MX can be an essential tool for monitoring LF infection in the population at risk, especially in areas where collecting blood samples during the daytime is challenging.
CREB-binding protein (CBP) is involved in many transcription events, but cell-intrinsic inhibitors of CBP are not well-defined. This study found that cellular USP12 interacts with the HAT domain of CBP and inhibits its acetyltransferase activity. USP12 positively regulates interferon (IFN) antiviral signaling independently of its deubiquitinase activity. During IFN signaling, USP12 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, reducing cytoplasmic USP12 and facilitating CBP-induced acetylation and activation of IFN signaling proteins. USP12 accumulation in the nucleus blocks CBP-induced acetylation of phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1), maintaining nuclear p-STAT1 levels and IFN antiviral efficacy. USP12 nuclear translocation provides potential strategies for IFN-based antiviral therapy. Protein acetylation is a broad-spectrum and essential regulator of cellular functions, catalyzed by at least five distinct families of acetyltransferases. The CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its homologue P300 are widely expressed and regulate over 400 transcription factors and regulatory proteins, affecting essential cellular activities. CBP contains several major domains controlling interactions with different proteins or acetyltransferase activity and localizes mostly in the nucleus. CBP can acetylate pY701-STAT1 in the IFN signaling pathway, regulating transcription expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A small molecule inhibitor (ICG-001) blocks the binding of CBP to β-catenin, decreasing tumorigenic phenotypes and promoting drug sensitivity in tumors. However, cell-intrinsic inhibitors of the acetyltransferase activity of CBP have not been identified. The regulation of the acetyltransferase activity of CBP remains largely unexplored. In this study, USP12 was found to interact with CBP, significantly inhibiting CBP-mediated pan-acetylation effects in cells. USP12 can be a cellular inhibitor of the acetyltransferase CBP, translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during IFN signaling. The accumulation of USP12 in the nucleus blocks the acetylation effect of CBP on pY701-STAT1, thus inhibiting the binding and dephosphorylation effects of TCPTP on nuclear pY701-STAT1. USP12 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus is critical for both activation and sustainment of IFN signaling. These findings could provide new strategies for inhibiting CBP acetyltransferase activity in cells and for improving IFN-based antiviral therapy.
In 2014, two orthobunyaviruses, Melao virus (MELV) and Oropouche virus (OROV), were identified in plasma specimens from Haitian children with acute febrile illness. MELV, previously not known to cause human disease, was isolated from five case patients, while OROV RNA was detected in one child. The strains were found to be closely related to those from Brazil. Symptoms of MELV infection included abdominal pain and lymphadenopathy. This discovery highlights the importance of viral genome sequence analyses in identifying outbreaks caused by emerging viruses. Orthobunyaviruses, enveloped viruses with a genome composed of three segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNAs, include several well-known causes of human disease. MELV, first isolated from mosquitoes in Trinidad, has been found to cause infections leading to antibody production in horses and humans. OROV, also first isolated in Trinidad, is known to cause Oropouche febrile illness and meningoencephalitis and has been attributed to over half a million clinical cases in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama. The identification of MELV and OROV in Haiti, where they had not been previously reported, underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance for emerging viruses.
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had significant economic impacts and has resulted in over 2.6 million deaths globally as of March 2021. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a major target for COVID-19 vaccine development due to its role in the virus's attachment to and entry into host cells. A DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation has been shown to induce both antigen-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene (pSARS2-S) resulted in higher antibody titers against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to immunization with the SARS-CoV spike gene (pSARS-S). Additionally, pSARS2-S immunization induced a Th1-biased immune response and protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge. DNA vaccines have several advantages, including easy design and production, stability at a range of temperatures, and low production cost, making them suitable for rapid and large-scale manufacturing during infectious disease outbreaks. Previous clinical studies have shown that DNA vaccines are safe and effective for treating or preventing infectious diseases. Recent studies have also shown that DNA vaccines can elicit antigen-specific T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies and further protect animals against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. However, the major challenge of DNA vaccines is the poor efficiency of DNA delivery into cells for antigen expression and consequently poor efficacy of the vaccines. To increase the DNA delivery efficiency, physical methods or chemical methods can be used, such as high-pressure air stream, gene gun, microneedle array, electroporation, liposomes, virosomes, nanoparticles, and cell-penetrating peptides. A Zika DNA vaccine delivered via electroporation was developed into a phase 1 clinical trial within 7 months during the Zika virus outbreak in 2015. EP combined with DNA vaccination greatly increases the efficacy of DNA vaccines. Many different electroporation devices for humans have been developed, including Cellectra® and TriGrid®. A DNA vaccination with EP has been shown to induce neutralizing antibody and Th1-biased immune responses and protect hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge.
The study documents health beliefs and health-seeking behavior towards Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention (MMDP) services for Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) in Luangwa District, Zambia. The perceived causes of LF include contact with animal faeces, use of traditional herbal aphrodisiacs, witchcraft, and sexual contact with women who are menstruating or had miscarried. Community members, particularly hydrocele patients, opt to visit traditional healers before going to health facilities due to fear of infertility or death from hydrocelectomies. There is limited knowledge of home and facility-based care strategies for lymphoedema. Health system and cultural barriers to seeking healthcare include long distances to health facilities, lack of awareness of existing MMDP services, perceived costs, gender and social norms, and fear of stigmatization. LF programs should promote strategies that empower patients and community members with information to access and use MMDP services and adhere to self-care practices. Despite progress in MDA programs, fewer lymphoedema and hydrocele patients have accessed MMDP services. In Zambia, LF is a public health concern, and MDA for LF has been scaled up nationally. However, there is limited information on what MMDP services are available and where and how LF patients are accessing them. The Zambian Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases National Masterplan (2019-2023) places emphasis on delivery of MMDP services in endemic districts, but there is a lack of a comprehensive national MMDP strategy for LF or suitable indicators to monitor progress in service provision.
HTLV-1 is a delta-retrovirus that infects 5-10 million people worldwide, transmitted through cell-containing body fluids. It has structural proteins, enzymes, and regulatory/accessory proteins (Tax, Rex, p12/p8, p13, p30, HBZ). HTLV-1 integrates into the host cell genome and persists as a provirus, replicating by infecting new cells or mitotic division of infected CD4+ T-cells. Cell-free transmission is inefficient, requiring cell-cell contacts for efficient infection. HTLV-1 transmission involves tight cell-cell contacts and long-distance connections, such as cellular conduits and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). The viral accessory p8 protein is required for transmission via cellular conduits. p8 is a cleavage product of p12, and localizes to the cytoplasm, recruited to lipid rafts and the immunological synapse. It increases the number of T-cell contacts, number and length of cellular conduits, and enhances viral infectivity.Recent research has identified vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) as a novel interaction partner of p8, which is important for p8 and HTLV-1 Gag transfer between cells. VASP is composed of an N-terminal EVH1 domain, proline-rich central part, EVH2 domain, G-actin-binding site (GAB), F-actin-binding site (FAB), and a coiled-coil domain for tetramerization. VASP promotes actin filament elongation and is strongly enriched in focal contacts and along stress fibers. Mapping the VASP:p8 interaction revealed that at least three different domains in VASP and a short sequence stretch in p8 (aa 26-37) are important for the interaction. Repression of VASP by gene editing strategies demonstrated that VASP is crucial for the transfer of p8 to target T-cells and HTLV-1 Gag, suggesting that HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission depends on VASP. The interactions of p8 with VASP could contribute to viral spread and the establishment of persistent HTLV-1 infections.
Tinnitus, a common form of auditory hallucination, affects 10-20% of the population and is often associated with hearing loss or damage to higher auditory processing pathways. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a key structure in tinnitus generation, displaying tinnitus-related plastic reorganization following cochlear damage. A recent study used an information theoretic-driven plasticity approach, specifically entropy maximization (EM), to model the connection between raw sensory input and its downstream representation in a recurrent neural network. This model was previously applied to the primary visual cortex, giving rise to orientation-selective Gabor-like receptive fields and driving early visual processing networks toward critical behavior. In this study, the EM approach was used to train a recurrent neural network to represent auditory stimuli, creating a simplified model for early auditory processing. The network was then subjected to sensory deprivation by attenuating a certain range of frequencies in the input. The findings show that tinnitus-like hallucinations naturally arise in this model following sensory deprivation, due to recurrent interactions compensating for the attenuated input by increasing their gain, causing the network to cross a critical point into a regime of hallucinations. These findings suggest that hallucinations following sensory deprivation can stem from general long-term plasticity mechanisms that act to optimize the representation of sensory information.
Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a betacoronavirus that primarily infects pigs, causing encephalomyelitis, vomiting and wasting disease, and influenza-like symptoms. PHEV is neurotropic and uniquely infects pigs through the respiratory tract, propagating from the peripheral nerves to the CNS. The virus has been identified as a potential model for studying the pathogenesis of coronavirus-associated neurological complications and olfactory and taste disorders in humans.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been associated with anosmia, ageusia, and neurological symptoms in patients. However, few animal models are available to study these symptoms and neuroinvasion. PHEV, along with SARS-CoV-2 and MHV, is a member of the betacoronavirus genus and has been proposed as a model for simulating SARS-CoV-2 infection.In a recent study, BALB/c mice infected with PHEV showed clinical manifestations including weight loss, sickness, neurological signs, and 100% mortality. The virus preferentially infects the brain and spinal cord, while no virus antigens or infectious virions were detected in peripheral organs. Infected mice also exhibited significant smell and taste impairments.Further investigation revealed that PHEV is able to cross the neural-mucosal interface in the OE and that the site of initial infection is the OB in the CNS. The virus was detected in the OE at 1 dpi, followed by detection in the OB at 2 dpi, suggesting that the olfactory route may be hijacked by PHEV for rapid neuroinvasion. The viral RNA was globally distributed in the whole brain, including the cerebellum, at 4 dpi and spread to the spinal cord at 5 dpi. No viral RNA was detected in blood samples from 1 to 5 dpi, excluding systemic spread via the blood and access to the CNS via transport across the blood-brain barrier or blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.In conclusion, PHEV is a neurotropic coronavirus that causes lethal disease resulting from brain infection and targets neurons in the CNS. The virus is able to cross the neural-mucosal interface in the OE and primarily infects the brain and spinal cord. The site of initial infection is the OB in the CNS and the olfactory route may be hijacked by PHEV for rapid neuroinvasion. The virus can serve as a potential prototype for elucidating the pathogenesis of coronavirus-associated neurological complications and olfactory and taste disorders.
The regulation of glycometabolism homeostasis is crucial for the health and development of animals and humans, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the switch from a feeding state to a non-feeding state are not fully understood. A study using the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, as a model revealed that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) upregulated the expression of the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor (Klf15) to promote macroautophagy/autophagy, apoptosis, and gluconeogenesis during metamorphosis. 20E upregulated Klf15 transcription in the fat body during metamorphosis via its nuclear receptor EcR. Knockdown of Klf15 delayed pupation, repressed autophagy and apoptosis of larval fat body during metamorphosis, and increased free fatty acids, glycerol, and free amino acids levels. Knockdown of Klf15 also reduced glucose levels, while knockdown of Atg8 further decreased free fatty acids, glycerol, free amino acids, and glucose levels. Glycolysis was switched to gluconeogenesis, and trehalose and glycogen synthesis were changed to degradation during metamorphosis, accompanied by the variation of related genes expression. KLF15 upregulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) expression by binding to the KLF binding site in the Pepck promoter for gluconeogenesis, which utilizes free fatty acids, glycerol, and free amino acids directly or indirectly to increase glucose in the hemolymph. Therefore, 20E regulates glycometabolism reprogramming and fat body PCD during insect metamorphosis via KLF15.
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has led to a global health crisis. Vaccination is a promising strategy to end the pandemic, with the primary vaccine target being the trimeric spike (S) protein on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2. The S protein mediates viral entry into the host cell and is a key target for neutralizing antibodies. A detailed understanding of the viral surface is essential for structure-based rational design of vaccines and therapeutics. Atomistic structures of S and the viral envelope are available, but static structures do not capture conformational changes of S or the motion of glycans covering it. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a dynamic picture of S and its glycan shield. An extensive glycan coat shields a larger surface area than expected, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics. A flexible glycan shield and hinge regions give the stalk overall low epitope scores. A computational epitope-mapping procedure was used to recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for structure-based vaccine design. The procedure is general and should be useful for other viral envelope proteins.
The study evaluates the effectiveness of recombinant type I interferon (IFN) as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Syrian hamster model. The study found that early administration of IFN-α, either one day pre-infection or one day post-infection, limited weight loss and decreased viral lung titers. However, administration of IFN-α starting at the onset of symptoms three days post-infection had no impact on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that early type I IFN treatment is beneficial, while late interventions are ineffective and not associated with signs of enhanced disease. The study also found that recombinant type I IFNs are being tested in clinical trials to treat COVID-19 patients, but the timing of type I IFN treatment may be critical for its efficacy and safety against SARS-CoV-2. The study aims to address this question by determining the consequences of recombinant universal IFN-α on the expression of the type I IFN stimulated gene (ISG) Mx1 in hamsters. The results showed that intranasal administration of IFN-α resulted in a significant upregulation of Mx1 expression in the nasal turbinates, lungs, and spleen of hamsters, indicating that this molecule was active in hamsters. Mx1 protein expression was detected in the main target cells of SARS-CoV-2, including pneumocytes, bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells, but also in endothelial cells and immune cells within the lung parenchyma. The study concludes that prophylactic or early treatment with type I IFN is beneficial in reducing weight loss and lung viral titers in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, while late treatment is not associated with any change in clinical signs compared to placebo treated hamsters. These findings support the hypothesis that type I IFN treatment may only be beneficial in patients with low viral load or with mild symptoms at the early stages of the disease, while it likely does not provide any benefit in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.
Schistosomiasis is a significant infectious neglected disease in the world, caused by blood trematodes of the genus Schistosoma and transmitted through freshwater snails belonging to the genera Biomphalaria, Bulinus, and Oncomelania. Identification of these snails is typically based on morphology, but this has limitations. A study used Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to identify both frozen and ethanol-stored snail species using protein extracts from different body parts. The study used a total of 619 field and laboratory-reared specimens belonging to nine species. The spectral analysis yielded intra-species reproducibility and inter-species specificity, resulting in the correct identification of all the specimens in blind queries. The study shows that MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable tool for the rapid identification of frozen and ethanol-stored freshwater snails without any malacological expertise, which can aid in the control of schistosomiasis.
Food and water-borne illnesses are major health issues globally, with 1.5 billion episodes of diarrheal cases and 3.5 million deaths in children under 5 years old in developing countries annually, 70% of which are attributable to biologically contaminated food. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are major food and water-borne parasites, with 90% of reported outbreaks occurring through water and 10% related to food. Both parasites have simple and direct life cycles, making them highly transmissible and resistant to chlorine disinfection. They can persist in the environment for long periods and infect other animal hosts, making them difficult to diagnose and treat. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable, with limited resources for investigation and high rates of infection underdiagnosis and underreporting.Currently, several highly sensitive and specific methods are available to detect Cryptosporidium and Giardia in food, water, and fecal samples, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry, and optical microscopic examination. However, these techniques require a good laboratory facility, well-trained personnel, and are expensive, making them unsuitable for low-resource settings. Therefore, there is a need for a simple, easy-to-use, rapid, reliable, and low-cost test method for the detection of parasites.To address this need, researchers have developed a smartphone-based microscopic assay method to screen Cryptosporidium and Giardia contamination of vegetable and water samples. The method consists of a ball lens of 1mm diameter, white LED as illumination source, and Lugol's iodine staining, providing magnification and contrast capable of distinguishing Cryptosporidium and Giardia cysts. The analytical performance of the method was tested by spike recovery experiments, resulting in comparable recovery rates with commercial brightfield and fluorescence microscope methods.The smartphone microscope system was tested for detecting cysts in 7 types of vegetables (n = 196) and river water (n = 18) samples. The results showed that 42% of vegetable and 39% of water samples were contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocyst, while 31% of vegetable and 33% of water samples were contaminated with Giardia cyst. The newly developed smartphone microscopic method showed comparable performance to commercial microscopic methods, providing a low-cost and easy-to-implement alternative method for simultaneous detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia cysts in vegetable and water samples in resource-limited settings.
"Echinococcosis is a significant public health issue in China, particularly in western regions, caused by the larval stages of cestodes belonging to the genus Echinococcus. In 2018, 47,278 cases of echinococcosis were recorded in 370 endemic counties, with a prevalence rate of 10.57 per 10,000 people. The disease is more prevalent in Tibet, western Qinghai, and Ganzi in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the ""hot spot"" of human echinococcosis in China. There is an urgent need for joint strategies to strengthen efforts for the prevention and control of echinococcosis in China, especially in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.Echinococcosis has a significant impact on people's health and the agropastoral sector in China. To advance knowledge of basic information for prevention and control measures, it is essential to understand the prevalence status and spatial distribution of human echinococcosis. A national survey of echinococcosis infection conducted from 2012 to 2016 showed that 368 out of 413 counties were endemic, with an overall detection rate of 0.46%. Tibet displayed the highest scores with a detection rate of 1.71% and an estimated prevalence of 1.66%.The life-cycle of echinococcosis parasites involves carnivores as definitive hosts and intermediate host animals. In China, two forms of human echinococcosis are found: cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by the larvae of Echinococcus multilocularis. Both CE and AE are major public health issues worldwide, heavily impacting patients and causing a mortality rate of about 90% in the past ten years if untreated or inadequately treated.Spatial analyses, including spatial autocorrelation and spatial scan statistics, are research priorities for understanding the prevalence, spatial distribution, and dynamic of echinococcosis within the Chinese population. These analyses can help prioritize and optimize control actions against human echinococcosis, measure the degree of aggregation of spatial unit attribute values, determine whether a variable is spatially correlated and relevant, identify aggregation patterns, and evaluate the correlation between each spatial unit and surrounding areas.In summary, echinococcosis is a significant public health issue in China, particularly in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Spatial analyses, including spatial autocorrelation and spatial scan statistics, are essential for understanding the prevalence, spatial distribution, and dynamic of echinococcosis within the Chinese population, prioritizing and optimizing control actions, and measuring the degree of aggregation of spatial unit attribute values."
Network-based intervention strategies, such as immunization, can be effective and cost-efficient approaches to controlling harmful contagions in various settings. However, these strategies often assume complete knowledge of the network structure, which is unusual in practice. In this paper, the authors investigate how different immunization strategies perform under more realistic conditions, where the strategies are informed by partially-observed network data. The results suggest that global immunization strategies, like degree immunization, are optimal in most cases. The exception is at very high levels of missing data, where stochastic strategies, like acquaintance immunization, begin to outperform them in minimizing outbreaks. The study also finds that one of the proposed variants of acquaintance immunization leverages a logistically-realistic ongoing survey-intervention process as a form of targeted data-recovery to improve with increasing levels of missing data. These results support the effectiveness of targeted immunization as a general practice and highlight the risks of considering networks as idealized mathematical objects, which can lead to an overestimation of the accuracy of network data and a foregone opportunity for additional inquiry.
Extracellular recording is a technique used to study brain physiology and pathology in animals and humans. As the number of recording channels and their density increases, it is important to understand how much improvement the additional channels bring and how to optimally use the new capabilities for monitoring the brain. This can be achieved by establishing what information about current sources in the brain can be recovered and what information is strictly unobservable for any given distribution of electrodes. This concept is demonstrated in the general setting of the kernel Current Source Density (CSD) method, which is a two-step procedure for estimating CSD from extracellular potential measurements. The first step is kernel interpolation of the measured potential, and the second step is moving the estimation to the CSD space. This can be simplified by introducing a large basis of CSD sources spanning the region of interest and constructing kernels from these basis sources. The kCSD method, which is a specific implementation of the kernel CSD estimation, can be used to estimate CSD in the brain. The kCSD method estimates CSD in a large, M-dimensional basis, but the experimental setup imposes constraints that force the model to an N-dimensional subspace, where the estimation really takes place. The structure of this smaller space can be understood by decomposing the operator K acting on the measurements, which guarantees existence of eigendecomposition. The kCSD reconstruction for a set of measurements is then given by the sum of the eigenvalues and the product of the kernel cross-function and the projection of the measurements on the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are the natural 'eigenmeasurements' corresponding to individual CSD profiles, and the CSD profiles form the basis of estimation space, which is called the 'eigensources'. In conclusion, the kCSD method can be used to estimate CSD in the brain by decomposing the operator K acting on the measurements and projecting the measurements on the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are the natural 'eigenmeasurements' corresponding to individual CSD profiles, and the CSD profiles form the basis of estimation space, which is called the 'eigensources'. This method can be used to understand the structure of the smaller space and improve the understanding of the estimation space.
In this study, molecular assays were developed to detect asexual and gametocyte stages of the four major Plasmodium species (Pf, Pv, Pm, and Po) that cause malaria in humans. This is the first description of molecular diagnostics for Pm and Po gametocytes. These assays were used in Papua New Guinea, where all four species are sympatrically transmitted, to investigate species interactions. The study found that the observed frequency of Pf-Pv co-infection for asexual parasites and gametocytes was higher than expected, with an excess co-infection risk of 1.38 and 1.37, respectively. This excess co-infection risk was partially attributable to malaria infections clustering in some villages. Pf-Pv-Pm triple infections were four times more frequent than expected by chance alone, which could not be fully explained by infections clustering in highly exposed individuals. The effect of co-infection on parasite density was analyzed, revealing a significant 6.57-fold increase of Pm density when co-infected with Pf. Pm gametocytemia also increased with Pf co-infection. Heterogeneity in exposure to mosquitoes is a key epidemiological driver of Plasmodium co-infection. Among the four co-circulating parasites, Pm benefitted most from co-infection with other species. No general prevailing pattern of suppression or facilitation was identified in pairwise analysis of gametocytemia and parasitemia of the four species. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, Trial ID: NCT02143934.
The authors propose a new method, IUSMMT, for survival mediation analysis, which is effective and powerful in detecting mediating genes in the pathway from DNA methylation CpG sites to the survival risk of cancers. IUSMMT is a gene-centric method that calculates P-values of the methylation-expression effect and the expression-survival effect as input, classifies the joint null hypothesis into three composite null sub-hypotheses, and takes the maximum of Pα and Pβ as a significance measurement in terms of the IUT principle. To enhance statistical power, IUSMMT estimates the proportion for each component of the three null hypotheses and constructs a newly empirical exact null distribution by fitting a three-component mixture null distribution. IUSMMT was applied to ten types of cancers available from TCGA and identified multiple genes with mediation effects. Results showed that DNA methylation CpG sites across the whole genome showed pleiotropic regularization on gene expressions of various cancers, but most of the detected genetic regions, in which gene expressions played key roles as active mediators, were cancer type-specific and exhibited full mediations lying in the signaling pathway from DNA methylation CpG sites to the survival risk of cancers. Overall, IUSMMT represents an effective and powerful statistical tool for survival mediation analysis and provides new insights into the functional role of DNA methylation and gene expression in cancer progression/prognosis and demonstrates potential therapeutic targets for future clinical practice.
The ability of an organism to develop different phenotypes in response to environmental cues is known as developmental plasticity, with the nematode Pristionchus pacificus exhibiting this trait through alternative mouth forms. A recent study investigated the gene regulatory network controlling predatory vs non-predatory dimorphism in P. pacificus, discovering that it consists of genes from different age classes. The study identified mutants in the conserved nuclear hormone receptors nhr-1 and nhr-40, which disrupt mouth-form determination and result in animals combining features of both wild-type morphs or altered morph ratios without intermediate morphology, respectively. These genes share transcriptional targets encoding extracellular proteins resulting from lineage-specific expansions. The evolution of teeth and predation in P. pacificus involved novelty at the level of genes, cells, and behavior, highlighting the importance of rapid gene turnover in morphological innovations. Molecular studies on developmental plasticity remain limited, with more research needed to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with this phenomenon fully.
Mitochondria, vital organelles within cells, contribute to intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamics through direct and indirect means such as calcium exchange, ATP generation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Abnormal mitochondrial depolarization can lead to arrhythmogenic Ca2+ alternans, but complex signaling pathways make it difficult to determine the underlying mechanisms. A study using a spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte computer model found that elevated ROS in response to mitochondrial depolarization plays a critical role in promoting Ca2+ alternans. The redox effect of ROS on ryanodine receptors and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, along with upregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, contribute to the development of Ca2+ alternans. Mitochondrial depolarization promotes Ca2+ alternans acutely via the redox effect of ROS and chronically by ATP reduction, while suppressing it chronically through oxidized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activation. Mitochondria play complex roles in intracellular Ca2+ cycling through various pathways, affecting the likelihood of alternans.
Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonosis causing fever, hemorrhage, and renal dysfunction, with cases reported in over 70 underdeveloped countries. China accounts for 90% of the total reported cases, with over 1.56 million cases and a 3.0% fatality rate since the 1950s. HFRS is caused by Hantaviruses, transmitted through infected rodent saliva, urine, or excreta, or by inhaling virus-contaminated aerosols. Rapid urbanization, water bodies, and land-use changes affect rodent reservoir dynamics, leading to HFRS outbreaks. This paper investigates the associations of rapid urbanization, water bodies, and other factors on the spatiotemporal dynamics of HFRS in Xi'an City, China, from 2005 to 2018. The study found that rapid urbanization, water bodies, and occupation type affected HFRS incidence, with higher associations within specific radii of water bodies. Geomatics approaches can support resource allocation and epidemic prevention strategies.
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that infects the stomach of approximately half of the world's population and can cause gastric and duodenal ulcers, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer. The bacterium exhibits significant genetic diversity, with strain-specific genotypes contributing to increased disease risk within distinct ethno-geographic populations. Whole genome sequence analysis of 39 clinical isolates from a single individual at two time points and from multiple gastric sites revealed 1,767 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.3x10-4 substitutions/site/year. Gene ontology analysis identified cell envelope genes among the genes with excess accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs. A maximum likelihood tree based on genetic similarity clustered isolates from each time point separately, with subgroups within time points having phenotypic differences in bacterial morphology, ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, and mouse colonization. The presence of subgroups with unique genetic and phenotypic properties suggests complex selective forces and multiple niches within the stomach during chronic infection. Overall, the study highlights the extent of genetic and phenotypic diversification within a single host and the importance of understanding H. pylori's genetic diversity in the context of infection and disease.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm species, are a significant health burden in tropical and subtropical regions, with over 1.5 billion people infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive chemotherapy (PC) to control STH infections. In Pemba Island, Zanzibar, STH have been historically highly transmitted, with a prevalence of nearly 100% in 1994. PC was introduced but not regularly administered until 2011 due to drug procurement issues. A 2021 survey found a prevalence of 80% (95% CI 78.1--81.5), with T. trichiura being the most prevalent species and over 32% of children having moderate or heavy infections.Despite over 25 years of PC in Pemba, the prevalence and intensity of STH infections remain high due to irregular PC, favorable climatic conditions, high population density, poor sanitation, and the low sensitivity of T. trichiura to benzimidazoles. Sanitation improvement is crucial to reduce STH prevalence and intensity. Possible changes to PC approaches include ensuring high coverage and compliance in schools, using mebendazole instead of albendazole, and co-administering ivermectin with mebendazole. However, extending PC to the entire population is not recommended due to higher costs and the risk of drug resistance. The authors emphasize that these views do not represent their affiliated institutions.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging, mosquito-borne alphavirus that has caused millions of infections in tropical and subtropical regions. CHIKV is an enveloped virus that enters host cells primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and fuses with the endosomal membrane to release its RNA genome into the cytosol. A study was conducted to examine the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of CHIKV infection and the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. The results showed that CHIKV particles exhibited two distinct trafficking patterns prior to membrane hemifusion: half of the particles remained static and fused in the cell periphery, while the other half showed fast-directed, microtubule-dependent movement and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells, impaired the delivery of the viral genome to the cytosol, and restricted fusion to the cell periphery. The study suggests that microtubules may direct the virus to a cellular location that is beneficial for establishing infection or aids in nucleocapsid uncoating. Furthermore, the microtubule network has been implicated in the endocytic trafficking of multiple viruses, including SV40, HIV-1, influenza A virus, poliovirus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.
Bacteria adjust to changing environmental conditions using nucleotide second messengers to transduce external signals into specific cellular responses. The essential nucleotide second messenger, cyclic di-AMP, controls potassium homeostasis and, unexpectedly, glutamate homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis. Glutamate toxicity in a c-di-AMP-free strain is suppressed by mutations affecting glutamate and potassium homeostasis, including a novel glutamate transporter, AimA, and a mechanosensitive channel of small conductance, YfkC. The c-di-AMP-free strain cannot grow on complex medium due to potassium, glutamate, and other osmolyte toxicity, indicating the global impact of c-di-AMP on cellular physiology. Cyclic di-AMP is unique among bacterial second messengers as it is essential in many bacteria and toxic if it accumulates, binding to proteins and mRNA molecules to control protein expression and activity. It is not present in eukaryotic organisms and is recognized by the human immune system, binding the STING protein and inducing an innate immune response. The essentiality and toxicity of c-di-AMP in bacteria have induced great interest in understanding the reasons behind it. Genes can be essential under specific conditions, such as the absence of amino acids from the medium, or can be quasi-essential, causing a substantial decrease of fitness for the cells. Essential processes have been ranked on a global scale for the first time by the determination of the speed of death of mutants. Two lines of research have provided important insights into the reasons of c-di-AMP essentiality: identifying target molecules that interact with c-di-AMP and studying suppressor mutants of bacterial strains that either lack or accumulate c-di-AMP. These studies support the idea that the control of potassium and osmolyte homeostasis is the central essential function of c-di-AMP in many bacteria that produce it.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to lymphomas and epithelial cell cancers, and can cause endemic Burkitt lymphoma and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompromised hosts. EBV suppresses cell-cycle checkpoints, allowing for unhindered cell proliferation. Specifically, EBV activates STAT3 to block ATR's ability to phosphorylate Chk1, which impairs RAD51 nucleation and homologous recombination repair (HR) of DNA double strand breaks. This results in error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) repair, making EBV-transformed cells susceptible to PARP inhibition and the accrual of genome-wide deletions and insertions. A STAT3-dependent gene-set predictive of susceptibility to synthetic lethal PARP inhibition is identified in cancers, expanding the range of cancers that may respond to synthetic lethal inhibitors. In lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) caused by EBV in immunocompromised individuals, current treatments have limitations, highlighting the need for additional strategies. EBV oncoproteins drive rapid cellular DNA replication, and EBV-infected cells experience replication stress. In EBV-transformed cells, STAT3-mediated disruption of Chk1 phosphorylation impairs RAD51 nucleation, HR, and recovery following experimentally imposed DNA double strand breaks, making these cells rely on error-prone MMEJ repair. Importantly, PARP1 is required for MMEJ-mediated repair, making EBV-transformed cells and potentially EBV-unrelated cancers susceptible to PARP inhibition.
Buruli ulcer, a necrotizing skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is one of the 20 neglected tropical diseases, affecting at least 33 countries with tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates. The disease has a varying clinical presentation and its transmission mode is unclear, making prevention and control challenging. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimize morbidity, costs, and long-term disability. The gold standard biological confirmation is the quantitative PCR targeting the IS2404 insertion sequence of M. ulcerans performed on cutaneous samples. However, due to the low PCR confirmation rate in endemic African countries, eleven laboratories formed the network “BU-LABNET” in 2019 to harmonize procedures and improve diagnosis. The first step of the network was to harmonize the procedures and ship specific reagents to each laboratory, resulting in a high success rate in implementing these procedures for testing and follow-up. The network aims to integrate other neglected tropical diseases into this platform, such as yaws or leprosy. The development of a reliable and standardized diagnostic tool is essential for the accurate diagnosis and effective management of Buruli ulcer.
The study of CD44, a versatile molecule involved in various cellular processes, focuses on its localization in membrane environments and how it affects the formation of the CD44-adaptor complex. CD44 has an ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, and its localization in lipid raft microdomains can suppress binding to cytoskeleton adaptors. The translocation of CD44 from non-raft to raft domains is driven by palmitoylations on cysteine residues, and palmitoylations control the association/dissociation switching of CD44 and Radixin. The signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) also plays a role in regulating CD44 behavior. PIP2, a multivalent anionic lipid, resides in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane and facilitates the association of CD44 and ERM by activating the FERM protein and supporting its association to the membrane surface. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the raft affinity and translocation of CD44 in phase-separated model membranes and plasma membrane environments. The results show a delicate balance between the influence of palmitoylations and the presence of PIP2 lipids, with palmitoylations increasing the affinity for raft domains and PIP2 lipids having the opposite effect. Additionally, the presence of PIP2 lipids allows CD44 and FERM to associate in an experimentally observed binding mode, while the highly palmitoylated species shows no binding affinity. These findings shed light on the sophisticated mechanism of how membrane translocation and peripheral protein association can be controlled by both protein modifications and membrane composition.
The ability of collective living systems to achieve complex functional tasks beyond the capabilities of individuals has been widely observed, particularly in social insects such as fire ants. During floods, fire ants form rafts composed entirely of worker ants, allowing colonies to stay together and enhancing survival chances. These rafts can explore flooded environments through cooperative morphogenesis, forming dynamic structures with a floating layer of structural ants and a dispersed layer of freely active ants on top. Protrusions emerge and recede perpetually over hours, facilitating motility and collective migration. While cellular systems utilize chemotaxis, durotaxis, or other gradient-driven mechanisms to initiate migration, it is unclear whether external stimuli are necessary for protrusion growth in fire ant rafts.In a study, an ant-inspired, agent-based numerical model was developed to understand the emergence of spontaneous protrusions in fire ant rafts. The model comprises a structural network of agents representing the monolayer of interconnected worker ants and a dispersed, on-lattice layer of motile agents representing free ants walking on the floating network. Local interactions occur between neighboring free ants within a detection radius, and treadmilling of the raft occurs as agents transition between the structural and free layers. The study demonstrates that phases of exploratory protrusion growth may be induced by increased ant activity, suggesting that functional morphogenesis of a living system may emerge purely from local interactions at the constituent length scale. Furthermore, the research highlights the potential of decentralized, autonomous active matter and swarm robotics.
The Culex pipiens complex, which includes Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. molestus, shows significant differences in host-seeking, blood-feeding, mating behavior, and vector competence. Blood-feeding mosquito behaviors are closely related to their olfactory gene expression and olfactory gene repertoire composition. Comparing olfactory genes between these two subspecies can support further research on the molecular mechanism of the Culex pipiens complex olfactory sensory system, providing a new approach for determining candidate attractant or repellent compounds. A study was conducted to investigate the possible olfactory gene repertoires resulting in the blood-feeding behavior differences between the two species in the Cx. pipiens complex. Transcriptome sequencing, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and RNAi techniques were used to identify and evaluate the roles of particular olfactory receptors in Cx. quinquefasciatus blood-feeding behaviors. Five, 7, 24, and 3 Cx. quinquefasciatus-specific OBPs, Cx. molestus-specific OBPs, Cx. quinquefasciatus-specific ORs, and Cx. molestus-specific ORs were identified, respectively. The RNA interference of OR5 and OR78 could inhibit the blood-feeding behavior of Cx. quinquefasciatus, providing new targets for screening effective repellent compounds to control mosquito-borne diseases. Cx. quinquefasciatus, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, is an important pathogen vector that causes human diseases such as West Nile Virus, St. Louis encephalitis, Sindbis fever, and equine encephalitis. Olfaction plays a vital role in the whole life cycle of mosquitoes, and the olfactory system of mosquitoes contains various olfactory proteins such as ORs, OBPs, and ODEs. Different olfactory proteins bind the same odor at different stages of mosquito development. Previous whole-genome analyses have annotated a wide range of variation in the number of olfactory proteins corresponding to different mosquito species. Culex pipiens form molestus Forskal and Cx. quinquefasciatus belong to the same Cx. pipiens complex and can be distinguished morphologically and physiologically. Although important differences exist in blood-feeding habits and other physiological behaviors between Cx. molestus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, the molecular mechanisms behind these differences are still poorly understood. The study aimed to investigate the possible olfactory gene repertoires resulting in the blood-feeding behavior differences between the two species in the Cx. pipiens complex. The screened olfactory genes involved in blood-feeding behavior would provide new targets for screening effective repellent compounds to control mosquito-borne diseases effectively and efficiently.
The hippocampus encodes spatial information through place cells, which fire when an animal is in a specific location within an environment. These place fields are formed through activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, but the mechanisms underlying their formation are not well understood. Recent experiments have shown that silent cells, which do not fire at the soma, receive place-tuned inputs and can be turned into place cells with the application of a spatially uniform current. This transition is abrupt and the amplitude of the place field does not depend on the amplitude of the applied current. The functional consequences of this gating of dendrite-to-soma propagation are not yet fully explored. Additionally, place fields may not be formed from homogeneously distributed place-tuned inputs, but rather through the selection of already strong connections without the need for synaptic plasticity. During exploration of a novel environment, new place fields are formed over several laps and are preceded by dendritic regenerative events, such as backpropagating action potentials or dendritically generated spikes. These events are promoted by a reduction in dendritic inhibition through the suppression of somatostatin-expressing interneuron activity. Place field development has been associated with dendritic disinhibition, but the roles of different types of interneurons in place field formation and stabilization are not yet clear. CA1 pyramidal cell depolarization increases during exploration of novel environments, but place fields in familiar environments are more stable, suggesting the involvement of complex spike-mediated synaptic plasticity in stabilization. Computational models have been proposed to account for place field development, but these models do not take into account individual interneuron types and their modulation during exploration of novel environments. A data-driven model of the hippocampal CA1 network is developed, which shows that somatic disinhibition, together with spatially modulated inputs, is sufficient to form place fields. However, dendritic inhibition and synaptic plasticity allow for silent cells to turn into stable place cells. The combined action of somatic and dendritic inhibition balances an increase in excitatory weights due to synaptic plasticity, so that place cells after exploration return to their baseline firing rate. The model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity and predicts that artificially induced dendritic events in place cells can shift place field location even after place field stabilization.
Molecular xenomonitoring (MX), the detection of parasite nucleic acid in vector populations, is recommended for onchocerciasis surveillance in elimination settings. However, the sensitivity of MX for detecting onchocerciasis-positive communities has not been well-evaluated. A systematic review of studies reporting the prevalence of Onchocerca volvulus DNA in wild-caught Simulium spp. flies and corresponding prevalence of microfilaria (mf) in humans found that MX detected positive flies in every study area with >1% mf prevalence, except for one study in the Venezuelan Amazonian focus. A significant relationship was identified between mf prevalence and MX rate, with mf prevalence accounting for half of the variation in MX rate. MX is sensitive to communities with ongoing onchocerciasis transmission and has the potential to predict human mf prevalence, but further data is required to understand this relationship, particularly from MX surveys conducted earlier in control programs before transmission has been interrupted. Compared to other diagnostic methods such as skin snips and serological methods, MX has the advantage of measuring current infections and not requiring invasive sampling. However, the utility of MX is currently restricted by an inability to interpret MX results in the context of the disease indicators that guide program decisions. The evidence exhibits the strengths of MX in identifying areas of ongoing transmission and supports the existing recommendations for MX use to determine whether transmission has been interrupted and for post-treatment surveillance. However, more data is needed to precisely estimate the sensitivity of MX and to understand the relationship between MX rate and mf prevalence, particularly in the earlier stages of control programs.
The study investigates the role of MASP1 gene variants and products in susceptibility to leprosy and its different clinical forms. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, with a 2018 global prevalence rate of 0.2/10,000 population, and Brazil contributed to 92.3% of the increase in new American cases from 2017-18. The disease's clinical manifestations depend on the host's genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors, ranging from the disabling lepromatous to the paucibacillary tuberculoid form. The lectin pathway of complement (LP) has long been recognized as favoring the establishment of M. leprae infection and development of disease. The MASP1 gene encodes the serine proteases MASP-1 and MASP-3 and the non-enzymatic protein MAp44. MASP-1 has procoagulant activity, cleaving and activating Factor XIII and fibrinopeptide, generating fibrinopeptide B and attracting neutrophils to assist the coagulation cascade. MASP-3 and Map44 also compete with MASPs for the same binding sites on the PRMs, thus inhibiting activation of the lectin pathway. Rare mutations in a highly conserved region of exon 12 of the MASP1 gene cause the 3MC1 syndrome, pointing to an important role in ectodermal development. Low MASP-2 levels, MASP2 polymorphisms associated with low MASP-2 production, low MBL levels, and corresponding MBL2 polymorphisms have been associated with increased susceptibility to leprosy. This study aimed to provide a better understanding of the immunological clinical spectrum of leprosy and the role played by the lectin pathway in mycobacterial infections.
Nongenetic phenotypic variation, or variation that arises between individuals with the same genome and environment, has the potential to either slow down or accelerate the rate of adaptation. While nongenetic variation can lower the fitness of a population and increase the effect of genetic drift, it can also smooth the fitness landscape, eliminating fitness valleys and making fitness gradients steeper. This can lead to a larger increase in fitness when a novel phenotype arises and the mutation underlying it can spread faster. A study by Bódi et al. (2017) found that yeast populations with higher variation in the expression of a gene that confers resistance to the antifungal drug fluconazole survived higher concentrations of the drug and evolved resistance more rapidly. A theoretical study has also shown that such a mechanism can operate close to the fitness optimum. Most work on the role of nongenetic variation in adaptation focuses on unchanging environments, but a theoretical study has predicted that in periodically fluctuating environments, genotypes underlying increased nongenetic variation can also be more sensitive to mutation, a property that may increase evolvability. Another study has shown that phenotypic plasticity, which can bring forth nongenetic variation, can protect a population against extinction when the environment suddenly changes or when it fluctuates randomly. However, the increased survival probability of a population with high plasticity does not necessarily lead to faster genetic change and evolutionary adaptation in the plastic population. A recent theoretical study has also shown that even when nongenetic variation increases the mean fitness of a population, this increase does not necessarily accelerate the spreading of beneficial alleles. To answer the question of whether nongenetic variation can amplify the fitness effects of a beneficial mutation in a fluctuating environment and thus accelerate the mutation's spread through a population, a study modelled how bacteria respond physiologically and eventually adapt evolutionarily to an environment in which the availability of a carbon and energy source changes periodically. The model focuses on the evolution of the lag time that bacteria need to resume growth after a change in carbon source. It pertains to an environment that switches periodically between two carbon sources and incorporates observations of bacterial and yeast behavior when the environment switches from a superior to an inferior carbon source. The model predicts that greater gene expression noise can increase the fitness of a population in fluctuating environments, augment the fitness increase derived from beneficial mutations, and accelerate the rate of evolutionary adaptation to the new environment.
The study of arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), involves understanding virus-host interactions in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. While much is known about viral gene expression in mammalian hosts, less is known about the interactions involving inhibition, subversion, or avoidance strategies in mosquito hosts. A novel RNA-Protein interaction detection assay was used to detect mosquito proteins that bind to dengue viral genomes in infected mosquito cells. The mosquito proteins Sec61A1 and Loquacious (Loqs) were found to be in complex with the viral RNA and have pro-viral functions in the dengue viral infectious cycle. Loqs interacts with viral protein NS3 and both full-length and subgenomic viral RNAs, binding selectively to the 3’ end of the negative-strand of the viral genome. The absence of Loqs does not affect translation or turnover of the viral RNA but modulates viral replication. Loqs also displays pro-viral functions for several flaviviruses in infected mosquito cells, suggesting a conserved role for Loqs in flavivirus-infected mosquito cells. DENV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that infects ~400 million people worldwide every year and is transmitted by mosquitoes. The DENV genomic RNA consists of an open reading frame that codes for the structural and nonstructural viral proteins, flanked by 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR). The 3’UTR is involved in multiple RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that regulate the efficiency of infection, modulate host innate immune responses and viral pathogenesis. A recent study used ChIRP-MS to identify numerous RNA binding proteins that interact directly with the DENV RNA in mammalian cells. However, there has been less investigation of proteins that form complexes with the DENV RNA and regulate infection in mosquito cells. In this study, an intracellular biotinylation-based approach called RaPID was adapted to identify mosquito proteins that form complexes with the DENV 3’UTR in mosquito cells. The study identified two mosquito proteins, Sec61A1 and Loqs, that interact with DENV RNA and have pro-viral functions in the dengue viral infectious cycle. These findings provide insight into the virus-host interactions in mosquito cells and the role of mosquito proteins in DENV replication.
Temporal environmental variations, such as seasonal changes and stochastic fluctuations, affect diversity in communities of competing populations. The covariance between competition and environment plays a crucial role in facilitating invasions of rare species through the storage effect. In two-species communities, stochastic variations result in shorter persistence times due to rare sequences of bad years. In diverse communities, the number of temporal niches available plays a significant role. When the number of temporal niches is large, the storage effect and periodic variations increase both species richness and evenness. However, when the number of temporal niches is small, global competition decreases species richness and evenness by focusing competition to specific periods, thereby increasing effective fitness differences.Environmental variations can have contradictory effects on species richness. While they have the potential to reduce species richness by increasing the chance of a population reaching low-abundance regions where extinction is likely, they can also stabilize a system of competing species and increase the persistence time of diverse assemblages. This is particularly relevant for diverse and highly diverse communities observed in nature, which appear to contradict the competitive exclusion principle and May's complexity-diversity problem.Theoretical works have provided analytical and numerical tools for assessing the stabilizing effect of environmental variations, while empirical studies have explored its manifestation in empirical communities. The potential role of stochasticity-induced stabilization in protecting genetic polymorphism has also been considered. Although many natural environmental fluctuations are stochastic, most of them have some temporal periodicity or seasonality. Seasonal effects on demographic rates, abundances, and frequency variations are well-documented for populations and genotypes.This study contributes to the body of work on the effect of periodic variations on coexistence by comparing periodic and stochastic temporal fluctuations with the same characteristics. The study uses individual-based versions of the lottery model, the canonical example of Chesson's storage effect, and implements the diffusion approximation to solve the models. The results show that periodic variations provide a more stable environment for coexistence, as stochastic fluctuations, even when promoting coexistence, can drive a population to extinction through rare sequences of bad years. The storage effect requires a larger number of temporal niches than the number of species for stabilization. When the number of temporal niches is smaller than the number of species, the same features of the dynamic that yield the storage effect lead to an increase in effective fitness differences and lower biodiversity. Seasonal cycles typically involve a limited number of different states, so if stochastic variations offer a larger number of temporal niches, they will play the main role in stabilizing diverse communities.
Functional non-coding RNAs (fnc RNAs) are crucial nucleotide sequences that significantly influence gene expression, genome stability, and human health and disease. A study used the Evolutionary Trace (ET) paradigm, originally developed for proteins, to identify functional determinants in fnc RNAs. By assigning a relative rank of importance to each base in a dataset of 1070 functional RNAs, including the ribosome, the researchers observed evolutionary patterns similar to those seen in proteins. Top-ranked bases clustered in secondary and tertiary structures, mapping functional regions for catalysis, binding proteins and drugs, post-transcriptional modification, and deleterious mutations. Smoother structural distributions of evolutionary important nucleotides improved functional site predictions. This work is relevant to studies of structure-function in ribonucleic acids and shows that evolutionary constraints among sequence, structure, and function are similar in structured RNA and proteins.
The source detection problem in epidemiology, or identifying the origin of an epidemic, is crucial for controlling outbreaks. This issue is mathematically reformulated as identifying the relevant component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model, focusing on cholera and similar diseases. The mixture model's parameters are calibrated using human mobility networks within a stochastic, spatially explicit epidemiological model for waterborne disease. A Bayesian perspective is adopted, allowing for the incorporation of prior information on source location, such as local conditions. Posterior-based inference is used, providing estimates in the form of individual locations or regions. The proposed method requires only the first-arrival times of the epidemic by putative observers, usually located at a small proportion of nodes. This approach is demonstrated using the 2000-2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.Epidemic control relies heavily on tracing the source or origin of an epidemic. In this context, the source localization problem involves estimating a source node in a complex network using network-distance-based measures of centrality, such as rumor centrality or Jordan centrality, or effective distance-based source detection. However, these methods often assume network-wide observation of the infection status of nodes, which is unrealistic for large networks. Sensor-based methods, which locate a source based on arrival-time information from a subset of observer nodes, are a more practical alternative.The paper proposes a method that integrates a sensor-based approach with a stochastic differential equation model for water-borne disease, using a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification and prior information incorporation. Human mobility networks play a key role in the method, as human mobility is a significant factor in infectious disease spread. The approach recasts the source detection problem as identifying the relevant mixture component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model, using human mobility within a stochastic, spatially-explicit epidemiological model to calibrate the parameters. The estimator requires only the first-arrival times of the epidemic at a small proportion of nodes, or sensors. The Bayesian perspective enables the seamless integration of available prior knowledge from previously observed spreading patterns or other data sources, and it provides measures of uncertainty in the resulting estimators.This integrative, Bayesian approach demonstrates significant improvement in the context of the 2000–2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, compared to a generic sensor-based source detection approach alone. The method's contributions include integrating cholera-specific transmission models in network-based source detection, incorporating the role of human mobility in waterborne diseases, and developing an informed prior probability distribution for Bayesian approaches.
Recent advances in multiplex imaging techniques allow for increased capacity in the number of markers that can be included in a single tissue sample, enabling a deeper understanding of spatial biology and cell phenotyping. However, there are limitations to the number of markers that can be included due to technical artifacts, tissue loss, and long imaging acquisition time. As such, it is important to select an optimal panel of markers that captures the maximum amount of information with the fewest markers. This can be achieved through computational approaches that determine the amount of shared information between markers. A study examining several panel selection approaches using breast cancer tissue microarray datasets and cyclic immunofluorescence found that correlation-based selection methods achieved the best single-cell marker mean intensity predictions. These methods can help researchers design more efficient multiplex imaging panels that maximize the amount of information retained with a limited number of markers. This is essential for tissue spatial biology and can serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets in cancer research and clinical management.
Leptospirosis, a global zoonotic disease, is caused by pathogenic Leptospira and transmitted through urine from infected animals, contaminated soil, and water. The disease can cause acute kidney injury and lung injury, with reported median mortality rates of 12% and 25%, respectively. In a study, hamsters were used as a model to understand the relationship between leptospirosis and chronic renal dysfunction. Hamsters were subcutaneously infected with pathogenic Leptospira, and the dynamics of leptospires and histopathological changes in the kidneys, renal function, and anti-Leptospira interrogans serovar Manilae antibody titers were examined from the acute phase to the chronic phase. The study found that subcutaneous infection with pathogenic leptospires could cause acute death or chronic leptospirosis in hamsters after surviving the acute phase. The renal distribution of leptospires during the acute phase probably affected the extent of tubular atrophy, leading to chronic kidney disease. The study suggests that the increase in antibody titer in the acute phase was necessary for the hamsters infected with Leptospira to survive the acute phase. The kidneys of the infected hamsters in the acute and chronic phases showed hemorrhage, petechial lesions, and the appearance of leptospires. In the chronic phase, the kidneys of the surviving hamsters showed no hemorrhage but were atrophied with multiple depressed scars, and moderate infiltrations of lymphocytes and plasma cells were observed in the interstitium and around the blood vessels. The distribution of leptospires in the interstitium was consistent with the lesion of tubular atrophy, indicating the possibility that tubular atrophy occurred in the presence of leptospires in the interstitial tissue. The deposition of leptospires in the renal interstitium gradually decreased during the chronic phase, while the lesions in the atrophic tubules remained clearly demarcated from normal tissue. Overall, the study demonstrates that the distribution of leptospires in the kidney during the acute phase can influence the decline in renal function during the chronic phase, suggesting a relationship between leptospirosis and chronic renal dysfunction.
Talaromycosis, caused by the fungus Talaromyces marneffei, is a serious and potentially fatal disease endemic in Southeast Asia, with high mortality rates in HIV/AIDS patients in Southern China, particularly in the Guangxi region. The factors influencing in-hospital death in HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei infection are not yet fully understood. To address this, a study was conducted to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify relevant prognostic factors and reduce in-hospital mortality. The study enrolled HIV/AIDS patients with talaromycosis at the Fourth People’s Hospital of Nanning, Guangxi, from 2012 to 2019. Clinical features were used to train four different machine learning models to predict the treatment outcome of hospitalized patients. The XGBoost model performed the best, exhibiting high sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. The model identified septic shock, respiratory failure, uric acid, urea, platelets, and the AST/ALT ratios as important predictive features. The high in-hospital mortality rate of patients with talaromycosis highlights the need for a machine learning model for predicting T. marneffei treatment outcome. The XGBoost model may have potential applications in mortality prediction and high-risk factor identification in the talaromycosis population.
Toxocariasis, a parasitic zoonosis caused by Toxocara species, is a significant public health issue in the United States, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and in New York City (NYC). A study found that Toxocara eggs are widespread in NYC public spaces, with significant levels of contamination in all five boroughs, and feral or untreated cats as the primary source of environmental contamination. Human ingestion of embryonated eggs can lead to visceral or ocular larva migrans, blindness, or neurological symptoms. Toxocariasis is underdiagnosed and understudied, with a possible link to cognitive and developmental delays in children. The CDC identifies it as a neglected parasitic infection, and it is a disease of poverty, disproportionately affecting underrepresented minority populations. Additional public health interventions are needed to reduce environmental contamination and interrupt transmission to humans.
Scorpion envenoming in Tropical America is a public health issue, with Tityus trivittatus being one of the medically significant species. This species is known to occur in southwest Brazil, central-northern and eastern Argentina, and has been reported in urban areas of eastern Paraguay where it has caused severe envenomation in children. In this study, the lethality, composition, antigenicity, and enzymatic activity of venom from a T. trivittatus population in Paraguay were analyzed. The results indicate that the population is of medical importance as it produces a potently toxic venom with an LD50 around 1.19 mg/kg. Venom neutralization in preliminary mouse bioassays was complete when using Brazilian anti-T. serrulatus antivenom but only partial when using Argentinean anti-T. trivittatus antivenom. Antigenic differences and variations in the type and relative amounts of venom proteins were found between T. trivitattus samples from Argentina and Paraguay. Additionally, mass spectrometry and proteolytic activity analysis suggest that population-specific proteases may exist in T. trivitattus. A genetic differentiation of 8.14% was found between the Argentinean and Paraguayan populations, which appeared to have diverged between the mid Miocene and early Pliocene. These toxinological and genetic evidence indicate that T. trivitattus populations from Paraguay and Argentina correspond to distinct, unique cryptic species. This suggests that further venom and taxonomic diversity exists in synanthropic southern South American Tityus than previously thought.
Bat-pollinated flowers have adapted to attract pollinators in the absence of light through the development of specialized echoic floral parts, which act as acoustic retroreflectors making the flowers acoustically conspicuous to bats. These acoustic adaptations are found in a few bat-pollinated species in the Neotropics and South East Asia, but it is unclear how common they are among other bat-pollinated plant species. A study was conducted to investigate acoustic traits of bat-pollinated flowers by recording a dataset of over 32,000 flower echoes from 12 different species, 6 of which were pollinated by bats and 6 by insects or hummingbirds. The results showed that bat-pollinated flowers have a significantly higher echo target strength, independent of their size, and differ in their morphology, specifically in the lower variance of their morphological features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was able to achieve a good classification accuracy of up to 84% with only one echo/spectrogram to classify the 12 different plant species, with bat-pollinated flowers being easier to classify due to the lower variance of their morphology. Echo-acoustic information is important for bats during the detection and approach of flowers, and there is evidence that bats can identify and classify plants and flowers by their echoes alone. Nectar-feeding bats, in particular, rely on echoes to recognize and categorize plant species for landmarks and food sources. However, it is unclear why there are not more bat-pollinated plant species that have developed floral acoustic adaptations. Echo features of bat-pollinated flowers need to be compared with echo features of flowers belonging to other pollination syndromes, such as entomophilous (insect-pollinated) or ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers, to better understand the acoustic adaptations of bat-pollinated flowers.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma worms, affecting millions of people worldwide, with China having a significant burden. The disease is transmitted through intermediate snail hosts, mainly Oncomelania hupensis, found in various environments, including lake/marshlands and hilly/mountainous areas. Traditional snail detection methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. To improve schistosomiasis control, researchers aimed to develop precise and accurate snail habitat identification methods.A study was conducted in Anhui Province, a schistosomiasis endemic area, collecting snail data and 36 environmental variables. Twelve models, including presence-absence and presence-only, were built and evaluated using indices such as AUC, Kappa, PCC, sensitivity, and specificity. The presence-absence models, especially those based on machine-learning, performed better than presence-only models. The random forest (RF) approach was found to be the most accurate, with all indices above 0.90. Distance to the nearest river was the most important variable for lake/marshlands, while climatic variables were more significant for hilly areas. Predicted high-risk areas for potential snail habitats were identified, primarily along the Yangtze River for lake/marshland type and dispersed in areas south of the Yangtze River for hilly type.This study provides a comprehensive risk profile of potential snail habitats, improving the efficiency and accuracy of snail control and resource allocation. By using precise examination methods, the true distribution and habitat type of snails can be better understood, ultimately contributing to the elimination of schistosomiasis.
Giardia duodenalis, a major cause of diarrheal disease in humans, is treated primarily with metronidazole and albendazole (ABZ). However, ABZ resistance in this parasite has emerged, prompting studies to understand the molecular mechanisms behind it. While ABZ is typically metabolized in other organisms by cytochrome P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases, Giardia lacks these enzymes. Instead, this study identifies flavohemoglobin (gFlHb) as the enzyme responsible for ABZ metabolism in Giardia. The researchers found that heme, an iron-containing cofactor, increases gFlHb mRNA expression levels, and that gFlHb interacts favorably with ABZ and its metabolites. Recombinant gFlHb shows high affinity for ABZ, ABZSO, and ABZSOO, and ABZ enhances gFlHb NADH oxidase activity. However, the turnover number for gFlHb oxygenating ABZ into ABZSO is much lower. Furthermore, gFlHb mRNA expression is lower in ABZ-resistant clones, and overexpressing gFlHb in these clones increases their susceptibility to ABZ. These findings suggest that gFlHb down-regulation acts as a passive pharmacokinetic mechanism of resistance in this parasite.
The assimilation, incorporation, and metabolism of sulfur are fundamental processes across all domains of life, but how cells deal with varying sulfur availability is not well understood. A study on the unresolved conundrum of sulfur fixation in yeast found that an uncharacterized gene product, YLL058Wp, allows cells to substitute for Met17p by reassimilating hydrosulfide ions leaked from met17Δ cells into O-acetyl-homoserine and forming homocysteine. This process enables cells to cooperate and achieve sulfur fixation, indicating that the collective properties of microbial communities facilitate their basic metabolic capacity to overcome sulfur limitation. Decades of effort have shown that a large proportion of the coding sequences expressed from eukaryotic genomes lack complete functional annotation, and this situation is due to the limited set of growth conditions used in laboratory experiments that do not fully represent the range of conditions organisms are exposed to in nature. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a key model organism for the discovery and characterization of gene function in eukaryotes. However, the broader genetic network of sulfur utilization remains less well understood compared to the utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources. Homocysteine synthase, encoded by the MET17 gene, is a key enzyme in the eukaryotic sulfur assimilation process, and its deletion renders cells auxotrophic for organosulfur compounds such as methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, or S-adenosyl methionine. This led to the widespread use of the met17Δ allele as an auxotrophic marker for genetic experiments. However, met17Δ yeast exhibits an atypical growth phenotype, and cells overcome the auxotrophy under specific conditions. This cell density and temperature-sensitive phenotype has also been described in distantly related yeasts like Candida albicans and Yarrowia lipolytica, indicating that it is not a species-specific phenomenon.
Juvenile hormone (JH) is a critical regulator of vitellogenesis, the process of egg development, in insects. It controls various stages of vitellogenesis, including vitellogenin synthesis in the fat body, secretion into the hemolymph, transport through the follicular epithelium, and uptake by maturing oocytes. However, the mechanisms underlying JH-dependent ovarian vitellogenin transportation are poorly understood. A recent study using the migratory locust Locusta migratoria as a model system has provided new insights into this process.The study found that JH triggers the phosphorylation of Partitioning defective protein 3 (Par3) via a signaling cascade involving G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), small GTPase Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and atypical Protein kinase C (aPKC). Par3 phosphorylation results in its disassociation from β-Catenin, the cytoplasmic partner of ZA core component E-Cadherin, leading to the disassembly of zonula adherens (ZA) at tricellular contacts. Consequently, this causes the enlargement of patency, the intercellular channels in the follicular epithelium, allowing the transport of vitellogenin across the follicular epithelium barrier.The study also showed that JH-dependent patency is regulated by the dynamic remodeling of adhesion and actomyosin contractility at cell vertices during oogenesis. ZA is a belt-like adherens junction that encircles epithelial cells to form mechanical adhesion between neighboring cells and builds up a compact epithelial sheet. The core components of ZA consist of a single-pass transmembrane protein, E-cadherin (E-Cad), and its cytoplasmic partner, β-Catenin (β-Cat). In summary, this study provides new insight into how JH stimulates insect vitellogenesis and egg production via inducing the opening of the paracellular route for vitellogenin transport crossing the follicular epithelium barrier. The findings reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying JH-dependent patency, highlighting the critical role of JH in vitellogenesis and oogenesis.
The text discusses a study on alcoholic-related liver disease (ALD), which is responsible for more than half of all liver-related deaths. Sustained excessive drinking can lead to fatty liver, alcohol-related steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver fibrosis, and eventually alcohol-related liver cirrhosis. However, it is challenging to diagnose ALD in its early stages as patients are largely asymptomatic. The main goal of the study is to identify relevant upstream diagnoses that can help understand the development of ALD and highlight meaningful downstream diagnoses that represent its progression to liver failure. The study uses data from Danish health registries from 1996-2014 to examine if it is possible to identify patients likely to develop ALF or ALC based on their past medical history. The study finds that ALC is the most common form of ALD in the registry data, and ALC patients have a strong over-representation of diagnoses associated with liver dysfunction. By contrast, a small number of patients diagnosed with ALF appear to be much less sick than those with ALC. Machine learning models trained and tested on the set of ALC patients achieve a high performance for data classification (AUC = 0.89). When testing the same trained models on the small set of ALF patients, their performance drops (AUC = 0.67 for NaiveBayes). The statistical and machine learning results underscore small groups of upstream and downstream comorbidities that accurately detect ALC patients and show promise in prediction of ALF.
Dendrite regeneration is a crucial process in the development and repair of neural circuits, and it is regulated by complex intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. A study of Drosophila class IV dendrite arborization (C4da) neurons has identified a key role for the microRNA miR-87 in dendrite regeneration. miR-87 is required for both developmentally programmed and injury-induced dendrite regeneration in C4da neurons. Specifically, miR-87 promotes dendrite regrowth during regeneration at least in part through suppressing Ttk69, a transcriptional repressor. The miR-87-Ttk69 pathway is conserved in mammalian neurons, suggesting a common intrinsic mechanism for dendrite regeneration in both insects and mammals. These findings have important implications for understanding the normal development of functional dendrite arbors and the functional repair of injured neural circuits. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying miR-87-mediated dendrite regeneration and to identify other potential targets of miR-87 in this process.
Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of gamma delta T cells, play an important role in the immune response to malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites. These cells can rapidly respond to phosphoantigens produced by the parasite without prior antigen exposure or processing. They have been shown to inhibit parasite replication in vitro and are associated with protection from P. falciparum parasitemia in vivo. However, chronic malaria exposure causes Vδ2 T cells to decline in frequency and malaria-responsiveness, and to exhibit transcriptional and phenotypic changes including upregulation of the Fc receptor CD16. This study investigates the functional role of CD16 on Vδ2 T cells in the immune response to malaria. The results show that CD16+ Vδ2 T cells possess more cytolytic potential than their CD16- counterparts and are able to respond to opsonized P. falciparum-infected red blood cells through CD16, representing a second distinct pathway by which Vδ2 T cells may contribute to anti-parasite effector functions. This response is independent of TCR engagement and is a new role for Vδ2 T cells and for opsonizing antibodies in parasite clearance, emphasizing cooperation between the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system.

DEER-PREdict is an open-source software program for predicting Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) distance distributions and Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) rates from ensembles of protein conformations. It utilizes a rotamer library approach to describe paramagnetic probes covalently bound to the protein and is designed for efficient operation on large conformational ensembles generated by molecular dynamics simulations. The software has been validated with experimentally characterized protein systems including HIV-1 protease, T4 Lysozyme, and Acyl-CoA-binding protein, and is available on GitHub and as a Python PyPI package. The need for DEER-PREdict arises from the plasticity and intrinsic disorder of many proteins, which require descriptions based on multiple conformations, rather than a single protein structure. Experimental techniques such as DEER and PRE NMR are used to characterize protein complexes, multi-domain, and disordered proteins. These techniques rely on the addition of spin-labels to the protein of interest, and DEER, in particular, probes magnetic dipole-dipole interactions sensitive to residue-residue distances ranging from ~1.8 nm to ~8 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations and conformational analysis suggest that the conformational variation of spin-labelled sites is rotameric and can be described by a finite number of defined structures. The rotamer library approach (RLA) has been applied to the MTSSL probe by Polyhach et al., allowing for rapid modeling of dynamic paramagnetic probes. DEER-PREdict builds and expands on this work, providing a software tool for fast predictions of DEER and PRE observables from large conformational ensembles using the RLA.
The study evaluates the performance of a novel Rapid LAMP-based Diagnostic Test (RLDT) for detecting Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in stool samples from children under 5 with moderate to severe diarrhea in Zambia. ETEC is a significant cause of diarrhea in children under 5 in low-middle income countries, but the lack of point-of-care diagnostic tools results in limited data on its actual burden and epidemiology. The RLDT, a simple and rapid diagnostic test, was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity in detecting ETEC toxin genes (LT, STh, and STp) using quantitative PCR as the gold standard. The study found that the RLDT has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting ETEC, making it a suitable tool for point-of-care testing in resource-limited settings. The prevalence of ETEC was 19.8% by qPCR and 19.4% by RLDT. Children between 12 to 59 months had the highest prevalence of 22%. The children's symptoms, social demographic data, and diarrhea severity were collected at outpatient clinics in Lusaka, Zambia, between November 2012 to September 2013. The RLDT detected ETEC directly from stool in under one hour, making it a promising tool for diagnosing ETEC in resource-limited settings. The study concludes that the RLDT is sufficiently sensitive and specific, easy to implement, and rapid, making it an attractive tool for point-of-care testing at health facilities and laboratories in resource-limited settings.
"The article discusses the use of the ASCA+ framework for analyzing multivariate outcome data from longitudinal intervention studies, which often generate large amounts of data due to the advent of ""omics"" sciences. The ASCA+ framework combines general linear models with principal component analysis to separate and visualize the effects of different experimental factors, but it has not been developed for complex designs common in longitudinal studies. The article introduces repeated measures ASCA+ (RM-ASCA+), a new methodology that can model metabolic changes over time and compare changes between groups in both randomized and non-randomized intervention studies, while accounting for unbalanced designs, randomized interventions, and missing data. Tools for visualization and model validation are discussed. The approach can facilitate interpretation of data from longitudinal clinical trials with multivariate outcomes. Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering the specific design and characteristics of longitudinal studies when analyzing multivariate outcome data."
This passage discusses a model for studying the time evolution of disease states in a system of biochemical reactions. The model is based on a reaction network, where the number of molecules represents the microscopic variables, or signs/symptoms, and the reactions represent the interactions between these variables. The diseases or disease phenotypes are defined as the macroscopic or emergent behaviors displayed by the sign variables. A defect in the reaction network, defined as a specific deviation in the reaction rates of the healthy network, can lead to a disease state. The model uses an effective dynamics for temporal evolution of diseases, inspired by thermal annealing of physical systems, to study disease development and its consequences for disease diagnosis in different stages of the process. The goal of the model is to provide a microscopic model of time-dependent signs and diseases that can be used for diagnosis from the history or dynamics of the observed signs, and that allows for the explicit modeling of disease-disease interactions. The paper uses synthetic data generated by this dynamical model to investigate the time dependence of the diagnostic performance with a simple probabilistic model of signs and diseases. The results show how the accuracy of diagnosis with such a diagnostic model improves with time as the reaction network deviates from the healthy state of maximum objective function. This information can be used to suggest an optimal intervention or screening time for specific diseases and diagnostic models.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is dependent on the amount of infectious particles present in the environment surrounding the susceptible host and/or on the proximity between the susceptible and infectious host. Infectious virus shedding early in infection correlates with transmission events, while shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection. High viral RNA levels late in the infection are a poor indicator of transmission. The infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 increases in a density dependent manner with viral RNA and their relative ratio is time-dependent. A within-host and aerosol mathematical model was developed to determine the relationship between viral kinetics in the upper respiratory track and viral kinetics in the aerosols and new transmissions in golden hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The results of this study can be useful for designing interventions.
The quantification of the overlap between two groups, sets, or communities is a common problem in various fields, including genetics, ecology, and computer science. When the two communities are fully known, the intersection of the two communities can be simply counted. However, when populations are only partially observed due to a subsampling or stochastic sampling process, the community overlap problem becomes one of inference. In ecology, the relationship between the diversity in one community and another is called β-diversity, and various indices and coefficients have been developed to quantify it. However, these coefficients have been shown to be biased when community sampling is incomplete and provide no measure of statistical uncertainty.To address these issues, various developments have been made, including recognizing that the measurement of β-diversity fundamentally relies on counting the species shared by the two communities in the context of the numbers of species in each community separately. Another set of developments has been to work with species abundance data instead of binary presence-absence measurements. A third set of developments has been to place observations of both abundance and presence-absence in the context of a probabilistic sampling process, allowing for the appropriate quantification of uncertainty through confidence intervals or credible intervals.Recent work has introduced a Bayesian approach to β-diversity estimation, providing unbiased estimates of the overlap between two stochastically sampled communities. However, this approach assumes that the two original community sizes are known a priori, which may not be the case in practice. Therefore, a method that leverages an additional and often available source of data in presence-absence studies, the total number of independent samples taken from each community, is introduced. This method produces joint estimates of s, Ra, and Rb in a Bayesian statistical framework, providing unbiased central estimates, the quantification of uncertainty via credible intervals, and the construction of Bayesian versions of various coefficients used to quantify β-diversity. This method is presented in the context of estimating the genetic similarity between pairs of malaria parasites from the species Plasmodium falciparum.
The study aimed to determine the diagnostic validity of ELISA and RDT among individuals with suspected chronic Chagas Disease (CD). A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, searching for studies published between 2010-2020 on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS, which assessed the validity of ELISA and RDT. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias and applicability of the studies. The bivariate random effects model was used to estimate the overall sensitivity and specificity. A total of 43 studies were included, of which 27 assessed ELISA tests, 14 assessed RDTs, and 2 assessed both. The ELISA tests had a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI: 98--99) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI: 97--99), while the RDTs had a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 94--97) and a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 96--98). The analysis of these two types of evidence constitutes an input for their use in diagnosing CD. The limitations of the study included the difficulty in extracting data due to the lack of information in the articles and the comparative clinical-type design of some studies. Despite these limitations, the study concludes that ELISA and RDT tests have high validity for diagnosing chronic Chagas disease.
The authors present a new computational model for dopamine (DA) transmission that considers release, diffusion, and uptake of DA, multiple terminal release events, and the geometry of the synaptic cleft to simulate concentration values comparable to physiological values observed in empirical studies. The model shows that synaptic dopamine release is negligibly recognized by neighboring synapses, and signal variability in target areas of dopaminergic neurons may arise from dopamine concentration variability. The model compares spatio-temporal variability in a simulation mimicking normal dopamine transmission in striatum to scenarios of enhanced dopamine release and dopamine uptake inhibition, finding different variability characteristics between the three settings. Clinically, differences in striatal dopaminergic signaling contribute to differential learning and reward processing, with relevant implications for addictive- and compulsive-like behavior. The model can help refine understanding of DA transmission, as classical assessment of DA tone in humans using PET is an indirect measure with temporal and spatial resolution issues. Dopaminergic signaling impacts various cognitive functions and behavioral features, with two types, phasic and tonic DA, subserving distinct functions. Phasic and tonic DA strongly interact, with prolonged phasic activity increasing slowly varying levels of DA tone and a potentiation of tonic efflux attenuating phasic signals. DA transmission shapes the DA signal through synaptic and volume transmission, with the former describing precise signaling between two cells and the latter referring to communication beyond the synaptic cleft. The presence of extra-synaptic DA receptors and non-synaptic terminals corroborates the occurrence of volume transmission. However, DA diffusion from synaptic terminals and its impact on DA transmission is not fully understood and might be crucial to explain apparent discrepancies across empirical findings. The new model incorporates the specific geometry of synapses and relies on a full numerical approach with the method of finite elements, in contrast to analytical approaches.
Female tick salivary glands undergo rapid degeneration several days post-engorgement, which may be caused by increased concentration of ecdysone during fast feeding and involves both autophagy and apoptosis. A study found that autophagy-related gene (ATG) and caspase gene expression peaked during degeneration, and Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides autophagy-related 5 (RhATG5) played a regulatory role. During fast feeding, RhATG5 was cleaved and calcium concentration and transcription of Rhcalpains increased in the salivary glands. Recombinant RhATG5 was cleaved by μ-calpain only in the presence of calcium. Treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) led to programmed cell death in the salivary glands of unfed ticks in vitro. High concentrations of 20E led to the cleavage of RhATG5 and increased calcium concentration and expression of Rhcalpains. RNA interference of RhATG5 inhibited both autophagy and apoptosis of the tick salivary glands in vitro and significantly inhibited the normal feeding process in vivo. Therefore, high concentrations of 20E led to the cleavage of RhATG5 and stimulated the transition from autophagy to apoptosis during tick salivary gland degeneration.
Yellow fever (YF) has seen significant changes in incidence and geographic extent in the past 20 years, with the largest outbreaks in South America since 1940 occurring in Brazil's previously unaffected South-East Atlantic coast in 2016-2019. While habitat fragmentation and land-cover have been implicated in zoonotic diseases, their role in YF has not been examined. This study aimed to determine the extent to which vegetation, land-cover, climate, and host population predicted the numbers of months a location reported YF per year and by each month over the time-period. Two sets of models were assessed, one looking at interannual differences over the study period (2003-2016), and a seasonal model looking at intra-annual differences by month, averaging over the years of the study period. The models reproduced the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in YF transmission with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.43 (95% CI 0.41-0.45) for the interannual model and 0.66 (95% CI 0.64-0.67) for the seasonal model. Vegetation type (EVI), heterogeneity in vegetation, and land cover explained much of the trends in YF transmission seen. These findings may help understand the recent expansions of the YF endemic zone and the highly seasonal nature of YF. Climate and environmental factors significantly influence disease transmission, particularly for vector-borne pathogens. These deviations may be due to seasonal changes in weather, phenomena such as El Niño, climate change, or alterations to land-cover. Rapid habitat change is often associated with disease occurrence, especially of zoonotic infections. YF is a zoonotic disease caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV), with two transmission cycles: sylvatic and urban. The sylvatic cycle has accounted for almost all cases since 1942 and has historically been confined to Amazonian regions. However, the area where YF is endemic in NHPs has seen rapid geographic expansion, resulting in five reassessments of the zone of YF endemicity since 2000 in Brazil. The reasons for this expansion are unknown, and outbreaks in Brazil’s South-East Atlantic forest in 2016-2019 have been the largest ever recorded in the country. This study investigated the drivers of YF transmission both intra and interannually, using temporally varying covariates related to climate, land-cover, vegetation, and human and NHP demographics. Covariates related to these were selected based on their previously demonstrated roles in vector-biology, increased suitability for disease transmission, or relationships with YF. The study examined the role of vegetation cover and its heterogeneity/fragmentation. The models accurately approximate spatiotemporal heterogeneities in YF reports, with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.43 (95% CI 0.41-0.45) for the interannual and 0.66 (95% CI 0.64-0.67) for the seasonal ensemble predictions.
The study investigates the role of Pavlovian cues on instrumental behavior in patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and healthy controls using a Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task. The PIT task includes instrumental training, Pavlovian training for positive, negative, and neutral cues, and a PIT phase where participants perform the instrumental task in the presence of Pavlovian cues. The study found that OCD patients showed a weaker Pavlovian influence on instrumental behavior, especially for negative Pavlovian cues, compared to healthy controls. This contrasts with increased PIT effects reported in other disorders characterized by compulsivity, such as substance use disorders. The reduced PIT in OCD may be due to impairment in using contextual information provided by the cues to adjust behavior, particularly when inhibiting responding in the presence of negative cues. The study provides insights into deficits in OCD from the perspective of Pavlovian influences on instrumental behavior and has implications for OCD treatment modalities focused on reducing compulsive behaviors.
The Apicomplexa phylum includes various intracellular parasite species, including coccidians, haemosporidians, piroplasms, and cryptosporidia, which have complex and divergent life cycles and adapt to different nutritional availabilities. Pantothenate (Pan), the precursor for coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis, is essential for all cells, and its biosynthesis pathway is conserved across various life forms. However, only coccidians can synthesize Pan de novo, whereas other apicomplexans scavenge it from the host. The Pan and CoA biosynthesis pathways are potential drug targets, and recent studies have shown that pantothenamides (PanAms), Pan analogs, can target CoA-utilizing enzymes and show potential as broad antiparasitic drugs against apicomplexans.The Pan biosynthesis pathway involves three steps: the hydroxymethyl transfer of ketoisovalerate to form α-ketopantoate, reduction of α-ketopantoate to pantoate, and ligation of pantoate with β-alanine to form Pan. Coccidians, including Toxoplasma gondii, encode the enzymes catalyzing the three Pan synthesis reactions in only two genes, with the first two transformations of the pathway catalyzed by a bifunctional KPHMT-KPR enzyme. The localization of KPHMT-KPR and PBAL in T. gondii revealed that these enzymes localize to the mitochondrion and nucleus, respectively, possibly pointing toward the initiation of Pan synthesis within this organelle.While Pan synthesis is not occurring in vitro in T. gondii tachyzoites, individual deletion of either KPHMT-KPR or PBAL gene in the cyst-forming type II strain of T. gondii resulted in the dramatic reduction in the number of cysts in the mouse brain, clearly supporting the utilization of Pan synthesis in bradyzoites. The retention of the Pan synthesis pathway exclusively in coccidians and the critical role of the Pan synthesis pathway for establishment of chronic infection by T. gondii are intriguing. T. gondii tachyzoites are dependent on exogenous β-alanine to produce Pan, and a selective pressure has likely led to the retention of an active Pan synthesis and acquisition of its precursors from the host.The CoA synthesis pathway is also a potential drug target, and studies have shown that targeting CoA synthesis enzymes, including PanK, PPCS, or CoASY, can have deleterious consequences in the host. Therefore, developing compounds that are very specific and ideally target parasite enzymes only is essential. The majority of enzymes involved in the CoA biosynthesis pathway are essential for parasite survival, indicating their potential as antiparasitic drug targets. However, antimicrobials that target the Pan-fueled CoA biosynthesis pathway could have deleterious consequences in the host if its activity is not specific for the metabolism of the parasite.Recent studies have shown that PanAms can target CoA-utilizing enzymes and show potential as broad antiparasitic drugs against apicomplexans. The potential of PanAms to target multiple downstream pathways makes them a promising compound class as broad antiparasitic drugs against other apicomplexans. However, inhibiting the Pan transporter presents a promising drug-based intervention strategy, and the existence of a highly divergent pathway, active in a different life cycle stage of the parasite where β-alanine supply is limited, cannot be ruled out. Therefore, further studies are necessary to identify the P. falciparum Pan transporter and develop parasite-specific inhibitors.
Membrane proteins are a significant class of proteins with unique traits, one of which is that a substantial fraction of their hydrophobic amino acids are exposed to the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers rather than being embedded in the protein interior. This trait has not been explicitly considered in protein structure and function predictions. To address this, a new characteristic and predictive quantity, membrane contact probability (MCP), is proposed. MCP describes the likelihood of amino acids being in direct contact with the acyl chains of lipid molecules. MCP is complementary to solvent accessibility in characterizing the outer surface of membrane proteins and can be predicted for any given sequence using a machine learning-based method trained on a dataset extracted from MemProtMD. MCP can improve the prediction precision of protein contact maps and structures. This new MCP property, easily calculated from molecular dynamics simulations, can be used for broad applications such as contact map and structure prediction of (membrane) proteins.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and efficient dynamical simulations to predict and control disease spreading. A study developed PanSim, a computationally effective and scalable agent-based microsimulation framework, to test control measures in multiple infection waves caused by the spread of a new virus variant in a city-sized societal environment using a unified framework fitted to realistic data. The study found that vaccination strategies prioritizing occupational risk groups minimize the number of infections but allow higher mortality, while prioritizing vulnerable groups minimizes mortality but implies an increased infection rate. Intensive vaccination along with non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially suppress the spread of the virus, while low levels of vaccination and premature reopening may easily revert the epidemic to an uncontrolled state. The analysis highlights that while vaccination protects the elderly from COVID-19, a large percentage of children will contract the virus, and it shows the benefits and limitations of various quarantine and testing scenarios. PanSim's uniquely detailed spatio-temporal resolution allows the design and testing of complex, specifically targeted interventions with a large number of agents under dynamically changing conditions. Epidemic management includes a variety of control measures ranging from non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, testing, and quarantining to vaccination, hospitalization, and beyond. Traditionally, these models are then run using ordinary differential equations, which then provides crude estimates on how interventions may affect the outcome of the epidemic. Differential equations can be relatively easily fitted to pandemic data but have difficulty dealing with population heterogeneity and spatial context at sufficient resolution, especially as intervention strategies often change. Stochastic, agent-based models (ABMs) can easily handle subgroups, complex scenarios and also provide indications regarding the geographic spread of the pandemics. However, they are compute-intensive as they rely on repetitions of many elementary steps and also require a large amount of external data for their parameterization. The study introduces PanSim, an agent-based model, and shows how it can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively contrast the effects of a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions, analyzing and comparing their efficacy. What distinguishes PanSim from other models is that it offers unparalleled resolution and performance in terms of infection events and agent movement, allowing it to capture finer details of epidemic development, such as individual contacts between agents in specific locations and/or specific times. In the framework, agents represent people who live in a virtual city and follow daily routines consisting of regular activities such as going to work or school, resting during weekends, as well as stochastically selected elements such as shopping, entertainment, etc. Specifically, in the presented micro-level model, 179,500 agents follow the statistical behavior of the population of the Hungarian town of Szeged.
A comprehensive, reproducible histologic framework for characterizing small bowel lesions in Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is lacking due to limited understanding of the histologic changes associated with this disorder. To address this, duodenal endoscopic biopsies from cohorts in Pakistan, Zambia, and North America were analyzed using a semi-quantitative scoring index composed of 11 parameters encompassing tissue injury and response patterns. The index was used to identify unique histologic features of EED and those shared with other enteropathies or histologically-identifiable subsets of EED. Eight of the 11 histologic scoring parameters showed useful degrees of variation. Overall concordance across all parameters was 96% weighted agreement, kappa 0.70, and Gwet’s AC 0.93. Zambian and Pakistani tissues shared some histologic features with GSE, but most features were distinct. An abundance of intraepithelial lymphocytes was found in the Pakistani cohort, and marked villous destruction and loss of secretory cell lineages were found in the Zambian cohort. These findings suggest the first EED histology index for interpreting duodenal biopsies, which should be useful in future clinical and translational studies of this disorder.
"This passage discusses the concept of ""transparent games"" in game theory, which allows for probabilistic observation of other players' choices before making a decision. This is in contrast to classical simultaneous and sequential games, where players either have no information or complete information about partners' choices. The authors demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partner's choice significantly changes the evolutionary successful strategies in both iterated coordination games and iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games. The ""Win-stay, lose-shift"" and ""Tit-for-tat"" strategies are predominant for moderate transparency, while a ""Leader-Follower"" strategy emerges for high transparency. These findings have implications for the study of human and animal social behavior, particularly in dyadic and group interactions. The authors also show that the probability of seeing the partner's choice influences optimal behavior in simple one-shot games and that the current choice for iterated games is influenced by the previous round's outcome. Additionally, the authors discuss the strategies that evolve in the transparent iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (iPD) and iterated (Anti-) Coordination Game (i(A)CG) through evolutionary simulations. In the iPD, the ""Win-stay, lose-shift"" strategy was predominant for low and moderate transparency, while the ""Leader-Follower"" strategy emerged for high transparency. In the i(A)CG, the strategies that emerged most frequently in simulations were ""Challengers,"" ""Turn-takers,"" and ""Leader-Followers"" for low, medium, and high probabilities of seeing the partner's choice, respectively. The emergence of the ""Leader-Follower"" strategy in the i(A)CG resulted in increased cooperation for high transparency. The authors also performed an analytical comparison of strategies and studied how various strategies perform against each other for both iPD and i(A)CG. Overall, the concept of transparent games provides a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints and sheds light on the complexity of decision-making in social situations."
Telomerase activity is the primary mechanism for telomere maintenance in human cancers, but around 15% of cancers utilize an alternative recombination-based mechanism called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Loss-of-function mutations in the ATRX gene are frequently found in ALT cancers. The loss of ATRX, combined with telomere dysfunction during crisis, is sufficient to initiate activation of the ALT pathway and confer replicative immortality in human fibroblasts. In epithelial cancer cells, the loss of ATRX combined with a telomere-driven crisis led to the initiation of an ALT-like pathway, but this process was transient and ultimately resulted in telomerase activation or cell death. Telomere sequencing revealed that all alleles, irrespective of whether they were elongated, were enriched in variant repeat types. Telomeres are repetitive DNA:protein elements that protect the ends of linear chromosomes and prevent their recognition as double-stranded DNA breaks. As a consequence of the “end-replication problem”, telomeres shorten with every successive cell cycle, ultimately limiting the proliferative capacity of cells. In the absence of a functional cell-cycle arrest, continued cell division and telomere erosion ultimately result in a period of telomere dysfunction, referred to as “crisis”. Telomere dysfunction during crisis leads to large-scale genomic rearrangements from which cells can escape by activating a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) that rescues cell viability but drives clonal evolution and tumor progression. The majority of malignancies, as well as stem cells, germ cells, and single-celled organisms, almost exclusively utilize the enzyme complex telomerase as their primary TMM. However, 15% of malignancies, predominantly those of mesenchymal origin, do not express telomerase but instead maintain their telomeres via the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) mechanism. ALT is characterized by extreme telomere length heterogeneity and an absence of telomerase activity. ALT can be suppressed by the abrogation of the key recombination complex Mre11:Rad50:Nbs1. Certain characteristics of the ALT phenotype are consistent with recombination-mediated mechanisms for telomere elongation, including Break Induced Replication, rolling circle amplification, and unequal sister chromatid exchange. Recent work has uncovered a strong correlation between malignancies exhibiting the ALT phenotype and mutations in the ATRX gene. ATRX is a chaperone for histone H3.3 and, along with Death Domain Associated Protein (DAXX), is responsible for H3.3’s replication-independent incorporation into the genome. Specifically, H3.3 deposition into telomeric regions seems to be altered in ALT cells, and correspondingly, telomeric chromatin dynamics are altered.
Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, utilizes an arsenal of secreted virulent factors for host cell invasion and survival. These factors are stored in specific secretory organelles, including rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules, which release their contents upon host cell recognition. Dense granules are secreted constitutively during parasite replication and play a crucial role in modulating host metabolic and immune responses. The small GTPase Rab11A, a known regulator of exocytosis in eukaryotic cells, has been identified as a key player in promoting the cytoskeleton-driven transport of dense granules and the release of their content into the vacuolar space. Rab11A also regulates transmembrane protein trafficking and localization during parasite replication and affects extracellular parasite motility and adhesion to host cells. The polarized accumulation of Rab11A-positive vesicles and dense granules at the apical pole of extracellular motile and invading parasites suggests that apically polarized Rab11A-dependent delivery of cargo regulates early secretory events during parasite entry into host cells. Rab11A-defective parasites exhibit altered MIC2 secretion and severe morphological defects. Dense granules are considered the default constitutive secretory pathway in T. gondii, and Rab11A has been shown to regulate their exocytosis and transmembrane protein delivery at the parasite plasma membrane. Rab11A also plays a role in vesicle budding from the TGN/ELC, cargo transport between the apical and basal poles of the parasite, and material exchange between replicating parasites via release of vesicles at the basal pole. Rab11A promotes DG transport by mediating their anchoring along actin filaments, at least at the parasite cortex. Rab11A-DN parasites exhibit a drastic block of GRA1, GRA3, and GRA16 secretion, and are impaired in their ability to release SAGΔGPI-GFP into the PV space. Rab11A may be required for DG docking/tethering at the PM. Rab11A also regulates the localization of other surface proteins in T. gondii, such as GT1 and ROM4, which are retained in intracellular vesicles and are no longer delivered to the parasite PM in Rab11A-DN parasites. Rab11A may not only play a role in the regulation of DG protein release into the vacuolar space but also in the trafficking of proteins localized at the PM during parasite replication. Unlike GRA protein secretion, DG biogenesis is not impaired in Rab11A-DN parasites. However, the IVN cannot be detected in the drastically reduced vacuolar space characterized by the PVM being closely apposed to the parasite PM in Rab11A-DN parasites.
The stimulation of a single neuron in the rat somatosensory cortex can elicit a behavioral response, with the response probability not significantly depending on the duration or intensity of a constant stimulation. However, the response probability increases significantly upon injection of an irregular current. A network of integrate-and-fire neurons with features of neuronal populations in the rat barrel cortex, including cellular spike-frequency adaptation, chemical synapses with short-term plasticity, and gap junctions, was used to study the mechanisms behind these experimental findings. Numerical simulations indicate that cellular and synaptic adaptation mechanisms alone may not suffice to account for the experimental results if the local network activity is read out by an integrator. However, a circuit that approximates a differentiator can detect the single-cell stimulation with high reliability, increasing the stimulus irregularity. This finding is in accordance with experimental results obtained for the stimulation of a regularly-spiking excitatory cell. The stimulation of a single neuron in the motor cortex can evoke a whisker movement, and single-cell stimulation in the barrel cortex leads to a behavioral response, contradicting prevailing hypotheses that relevant signals can only be encoded in the activity of large neural populations. Theoretical models of cortical populations as random networks of synaptically coupled excitatory and inhibitory cells can show asynchronous irregular activity, and injecting a current into a single neuron in such a generic network model can lead to sizable changes in a subpopulation’s activity. A very small bias in a recurrent network with feed-forward inhibition can lead to a detection performance comparable to that in the behavioral experiment. The results of nanostimulation experiments in the barrel cortex of behaving rats, which demonstrated striking dependencies of the behavioral response on the properties of the stimulating current, are challenging to explain with generic setups previously investigated in the context of single-cell stimulation. A network with three distinct cell types, recurrent connections, and different readout methods was studied to tackle this problem, and a basic excitatory-inhibitory circuit was found to approximate the differentiator, demonstrating a response similar to the behavioral response observed in the experiments.
Human skin cells accumulate somatic mutations throughout an individual's lifetime due to environmental and endogenous DNA damage. A study of single cell-derived clonal lineages from primary skin cells of healthy individuals across a wide range of ages found that the mutation load and types of somatic genome changes accumulating in skin cells are extensive. UV-induced base substitutions, insertions, and deletions were prominent even in sun-shielded skin, and mutations due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines and DNA replication errors also increased linearly with age. Gross chromosomal rearrangements were found to be potent sources of genome instability and carcinogenesis. These results highlight the importance of understanding the impact of DNA damage on genome stability in healthy cancer-free tissues and the role of DNA repair pathways in preventing cancer development.
Clonorchiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis, is a public health issue in endemic countries, including Vietnam. In Vietnam, a comprehensive analysis of risk factors for clonorchiasis is lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of C. sinensis infection and associated risk factors in rural communities in northern Vietnam. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in four communes in Yen Bai and Thanh Hoa provinces, where clonorchiasis is known to be present and raw fish consumption is common. The overall prevalence of C. sinensis infection was 40.4%, with commune prevalences ranging between 26.5% and 53.3%. Male gender, recent consumption of raw fish, low education level, lack of treatment, being between 19 to 39 years old, and the presence of an unhygienic toilet were significantly associated with C. sinensis infection. This study demonstrated a high prevalence of C. sinensis infection in rural communities in northern Vietnam, highlighting the need for control measures such as mass drug administration and health education activities for risk groups in endemic areas.Clonorchiasis is caused by the liver fluke C. sinensis and is endemic in China, Taiwan, Korea, eastern Russia, and northern Vietnam, with the potential to spread to non-endemic regions due to international markets, migration, and travel. The life cycle of C. sinensis requires three host species: a freshwater snail, a freshwater fish, and humans or other piscivorous mammals. People become infected upon consumption of raw, undercooked, or salt-preserved fish containing metacercariae. Chronic infections can lead to clinical complications such as bile duct obstruction, stone formation, cholangitis, hepatic fibrosis, and cholangiocarcinoma. The global number of people at risk for C. sinensis is estimated at 600 million, with over 35 million people infected and 2 million showing symptoms, contributing to more than 5500 deaths each year.In Vietnam, C. sinensis is present in the north, while Opisthorchis viverrini, the Southeast Asian liver fluke, is prevalent in the south and center of the country. Few studies have investigated risk factors associated with C. sinensis infection in Vietnam. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of C. sinensis infection and identify associated risk factors in four communes in northern Vietnam. The study was conducted in Yen Bai and Thanh Hoa provinces, where recent studies suggested a high endemicity of clonorchiasis and raw fish consumption is common. The study found a high prevalence of C. sinensis infection and identified several risk factors, including male gender, recent consumption of raw fish, low education level, lack of treatment, being between 19 to 39 years old, and the presence of an unhygienic toilet.In conclusion, this study demonstrated a high prevalence of C. sinensis infection in rural communities in northern Vietnam, highlighting the need for control measures such as mass drug administration and health education activities for risk groups in endemic areas. Further studies are needed to investigate risk factors for clonorchiasis in the Vietnamese setting to guide the development of efficient control programs, which include health education campaigns.
Skin problems, particularly parasitic skin diseases, are major health issues in communities with poor living conditions, but they have received less attention in national or global health studies due to their low mortality rates. In many developing regions, the prevalence of parasitic skin diseases among schoolchildren is not reported. This study aimed to assess the occurrence and risk factors of skin infections among rural schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia using both a frequentist and Bayesian approach. The study found that almost three-fourths of the sample had at least one type of skin problem, with boys at higher overall risk than girls. Risk factors included unclean fingernails, not washing the body and hair with soap every week, sharing a bed, clothes, or combs, and living in a poor household. The findings suggest the need to improve children’s personal hygiene via health education by schoolteachers and health workers. Skin problems are major causes of disability worldwide, with over 200 million people affected by scabies and prevalence ranging from 0.2% to 71%. Half of school-aged children in southern Ethiopia have scabies. Ethiopia has a favorable environment for jigger fleas, and the prevalence of tungiasis ranges between 35% to 60% among school-aged children in southern Ethiopia. Tinea is a fungal infection caused by dermatophyte infestation, with one in five children in Africa affected. Poor hygiene, large families, overcrowding, shared fomites, poverty, and environmental conditions are important underlying social determinants for these three diseases. Most studies on skin problems among primary schoolchildren in Ethiopia did not assess them collectively or focus on scabies. Reports of scabies, tungiasis, and tinea prevalence among schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia have not been compiled independently. Previous studies have used a frequentist approach to identify risk factors, and this study aimed to examine whether a Bayesian model can provide important and additional information for assessing and managing these diseases.
Mycobacteria, which cause diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy, manipulate host signaling and immune pathways to increase their survival and establish chronic infection within cell-rich granulomas. MicroRNA (miRNA), small non-coding RNA, regulate gene expression and are dynamically regulated during mycobacterial infection, suggesting a key role in the host response to infection. This study focuses on miR-206, a miRNA associated with muscle development, which is differentially regulated in mycobacterial infection. Using the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model, the researchers found that miR-206 is upregulated following infection by pathogenic M. marinum. Knockdown of miR-206 results in reduced bacterial burden and enhanced neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection, which is dependent on the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling axis. These results suggest that pathogenic mycobacteria induce host miR-206 expression to suppress Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling and prevent protective neutrophil recruitment to granulomas, aiding the creation of a permissive niche for mycobacterial infection.
The robustness of developing and homeostatic tissues is maintained by spatiotemporal cell-to-cell interactions, which are feedback mechanisms that prevent overgrowth or depletion. These interactions can range from direct cell contacts to more indirect and longer range forms such as niche competition, and can occur simultaneously or with a delay. While high-throughput single-cell analyses have attempted to probe these interactions, live imaging of tissues followed by accurate tracking of the cells is still the most direct method to probe the details of the spatiotemporal feedback. A study of the mouse hind paw epidermis found that the skin stem cells have coordinated fate between the nearest-neighbors within a short time frame, with cell divisions coordinating with neighboring cell delamination (due to differentiation) with a 1-2 day delay. However, it is unknown whether such short spatiotemporal range of coordination and the time-ordering found in the hind paw epidermis is adopted in other tissues. To compare the cell coordination rules adopted in different tissues, it would be desirable to have a generic framework of analysis where such rules can be suggested unbiasedly. To this end, a graph neural network (GNN) framework can be trained to predict the future behavior of cells from past data and later challenge the model to extract the rules that have been learned by the machine. This GNN framework is particularly suited for representing the heterogeneous interactions between cells as well as the intracellular features extractable from image data such as cell shapes and gene expressions. The GNN model has been successful in forward dynamics predictions of physical systems and in inferring the rules of agent-interactions from timelapse data. In a study of the mouse skin stem cells, a GNN model constructed from cell contacts and cell lineage was able to predict the fates of the cells, indicating that the graph structure encodes significant information of cellular dynamics. The rules learned by the GNN model were then extracted by ablating the input features, re-configuring the model step-by-step, and employing the attribution method. As a result, neighboring cell fate coordination rules were found that had been overlooked in the paw skin data, as well as rules that were consistent with previously conducted fate imbalance analyses. The GNN model was then applied to novel data to extract and compare the different cell fate coordination rules across tissues, demonstrating how the GNN model can be applied to highly stochastic kinetics with agent loss and gain and how it can be utilized in solving the mechanism of multicellular kinetics systematically.
The study presents a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers using matched miRNA and gene expression data. TSCCA is able to overcome the limitations of existing solutions and capture both cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. The performance of TSCCA was evaluated using simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database. The study uncovers several dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance, providing insights into miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and potential miRNA-based treatments. Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, and the second leading cause of death worldwide. While medical advances have been made in earlier diagnosis and effective treatments, critical challenges remain, such as cancer drug resistance, combinatorial drug treatment optimization, and personalized cancer therapy design. Abnormal microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play important roles in the occurrence and development of cancer, and some miRNAs can be used as drug targets for cancer treatment. TSCCA is a statistical learning model that calculates a cancer-miRNA-gene correlation tensor and decomposes it into latent factors representing major patterns of variation in the tensor data. Based on the non-zero elements of the scores of genes, miRNAs, and cancers, cancer-miRNA-gene modules are discovered. TSCCA was applied to a multi-omics data set of 33 cancer types from the TCGA database and discovered some dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance.
The article investigates the interaction of short- and long-term plasticity during induction protocols of synaptic long-term changes using combinations of firing rate and spike-timing. Short-term plasticity (STP) occurs on a time scale of seconds to minutes, while long-term plasticity lasts from hours to a lifetime and is thought to form the basis of learning and memory. Both forms of plasticity have been extensively studied, but their interaction and how they shape synaptic dynamics is not well understood. The study uses a calcium-based model where pre- and postsynaptic activity induces calcium transients driving synaptic long-term plasticity. The model implements known synaptic short-term dynamics in the calcium transients and is fitted to long-term plasticity data obtained in visual- and somatosensory cortex. The findings suggest that short- and long-term plasticity are together tuned to adapt plasticity to area-specific activity statistics such as firing rates. Additionally, the study considers the impact of presynaptic action potentials on the postsynaptic neuron's excitability, which varies on multiple time scales, and the role of short-term synaptic changes for long-term plasticity induction has attracted little attention. The study uses plasticity models of different complexities and degrees of biological realism to capture the link between one or several stimulation protocols that induce long-term plasticity. A biophysically inspired model is used where both pre- and postsynaptic spike-trains induce postsynaptic calcium elevations which in turn drive plastic changes. The study aims to integrate a deterministic model of short-term depression in the calcium-based model of long-term plasticity to address the interaction between short- and long-term plasticity during induction protocols of synaptic long-term changes using combinations of firing rate and spike-timing.
Bats are the natural reservoir hosts for various zoonotic viruses, including Hendra virus (HeV) which causes severe clinical disease in humans and other susceptible hosts. While in vitro studies have shown that bats have the ability to avoid clinical disease following infection with viruses like HeV due to their innate immunity, information on the early host response to infection in vivo is lacking. A study was conducted to examine the sites of HeV replication and the immune response of infected Australian black flying foxes and ferrets at 12, 36, and 60 hours post exposure (hpe). The study found that viral antigen was detected in the lungs of bats at 60 hpe, while in ferrets, there was evidence of widespread viral RNA and antigen by 60 hpe. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on lung tissue from bats and ferrets was performed at 0 and 60 hpe to obtain a global overview of viral and host protein expression. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of immune pathways revealed that six pathways, including a number involved in cell mediated immunity, were more likely to be upregulated in bat lung compared to ferrets. GO analysis also revealed enrichment of the type I IFN signaling pathway in bats and ferrets. This study is the first to provide comparative data on the activation of immune pathways in bats and ferrets in vivo following infection. Bats are known to coexist with a variety of viruses without developing clinical signs of disease, and this study provides important comparative data on differences in the dissemination of HeV and the activation of immune pathways in bats and ferrets following infection.
CLiP is a method to detect heterogeneity in single GWAS cohorts by calculating a weighted sum of correlations between SNPs contributing to a PRS on the case/control liability scale. It has been demonstrated mathematically and through simulation that among i.i.d homogeneous cases generated by a liability threshold model, significant anti-correlations are expected between otherwise independent predictors due to ascertainment on the hidden liability score. In the presence of heterogeneity from distinct etiologies, confounding by covariates, or mislabeling, these correlation patterns are altered predictably. CLiP and its extensions, CLiP-X and CLiP-Y, can reliably distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous cohorts when the PRS explains as low as 3% of variance on the liability scale and cohorts comprise 50,000 - 100,000 samples. The method has been applied to heterogeneity detection in schizophrenia cohorts and neuroticism in over 10,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, detecting heterogeneity with high significance.GWAS have identified thousands of genomic risk factors and generated insights into disease etiologies and potential treatments. The liability threshold model assumes case/control labels are sampled by thresholding a hidden quantitative PRS with linear effects over SNPs. This view underlies predicting risks of disease using PRSs and quantifying the variance explained of the PRS. Heterogeneity of diseases has not been sufficiently recognized by GWAS, and elucidating the nature of heterogeneity in these traits may play a role in addressing the missing heritability problem in GWAS.Methods to develop population-differentiated PRSs and detect deficiencies in existing PRSs are urgently needed before predictive genomics can be widely integrated into precision medicine. Few strategies have been proposed to identify subtypes in GWAS cohorts due to challenges such as small signals in polygenic traits and confounding sources of heterogeneity. A method using non-negative matrix factorization of the cohort genotype data has failed to take into account alternative sources of heterogeneity, while another method using a Bayesian latent factor model is under-powered to detect heterogeneity in single phenotypes.Heterogeneity has also surfaced as a possible confounding factor in the discovery of pleiotropic associations between phenotypes. The proposed method BUHMBOX operates on a matrix comprising cases for one disease genotyped over the associated SNPs for a second disease, but this method is contingent on the assumption that case/control GWAS behaves according to a liability threshold model rather than a logistic model. The goals of the proposed CLiP method are to demonstrate the negative bias in heterogeneity scores differing significantly depending on whether the logistic or liability threshold model is assumed for polygenic traits, evaluate the power of CLiP across realistic GWAS scenarios, and develop extensions of CLiP to accommodate parameters that are not binomial genotypes.
A CNN model was developed to enhance the identification of influenza virus in clinical practice, addressing the limitations of current cell culture systems which rely on subjective observation of cytopathic effects (CPE) and subsequent use of virus-specific monoclonal antibodies. The CNN model, trained on 601 images of mock-infected and influenza-infected MDCK cells, achieved a recognition rate of 99.75% on an additional 400 test images. The model's ability to evaluate changes in CPE over time was further examined using 1190 images from a new experiment, with recognition rates of 71.80%, 98.25%, and 87.46% at 16, 28, and 40 hours post-infection, respectively. The specificity of the model was 100% when tested on images of MDCK cells infected by six other non-influenza viruses. This simple CNN model offers a more objective and efficient method for identifying influenza virus in clinical practice, improving upon traditional cell culture systems.
Varicella zoster virus (VZV), a member of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily, is responsible for causing chickenpox and shingles. A novel viral RHIM (RHIM-containing protein) has been identified in the VZV capsid triplex protein, ORF20, which acts as a host cell death inhibitor. This RHIM forms fibrillar functional amyloid complexes and hybrid amyloid complexes with human ZBP1, a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acid. The ORF20 RHIM is important for preventing ZBP1-driven apoptosis during VZV infection. VZV has evolved mechanisms to undermine host responses, including manipulating host cell death pathways such as apoptosis and necroptosis, to successfully spread and establish latency. Cell death can be initiated upon sensing of a viral pathogen, and apoptosis and necroptosis may form part of the antiviral response. The RIPK1:RIPK3 necrosome complex, stabilized by an amyloid cross-β core, generates necroptosis. Some viruses, including HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, and MCMV, have evolved mechanisms to inhibit caspase 8 and therefore extrinsic apoptosis and necroptosis. VZV contains a RHIM in the ORF20 capsid triplex protein, which interacts with RIPK3 and ZBP1 RHIMs in vitro, but its primary function appears to be the suppression of ZBP1-driven apoptosis through the formation of decoy hybrid amyloid structures.
This passage discusses a study on the risk factors for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma haematobium. The study found that the presence of the disease is most strongly associated with the hazard (i.e. the presence of infected snails in the water) and vulnerability (i.e. socio-economic factors that increase the likelihood of exposure), while the intensity of the disease is most strongly associated with exposure (i.e. contact with infected water) and hazard. These findings highlight the importance of considering both environmental and social factors in understanding and addressing the risk of infectious diseases.Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem, affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The disease is transmitted through contact with freshwater containing infected snails, and is therefore heavily influenced by environmental and social factors. In this study, the researchers collected data on parasitological, ecological, and socio-economic factors in 13 villages in the lower basin of the Senegal River. They then used statistical models to determine the relative contribution of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability to the presence and intensity of S. haematobium infection.The results showed that hazard was the most important factor in the presence of S. haematobium, followed by vulnerability. This suggests that efforts to reduce the transmission of schistosomiasis should focus on reducing the presence of infected snails in the water, as well as addressing socio-economic factors that increase the likelihood of exposure. For example, improving access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and implementing snail control measures, can help to reduce the risk of infection.Exposure was the most important factor in the intensity of S. haematobium, followed by hazard. This suggests that efforts to reduce the severity of the disease should focus on reducing exposure to infected water, as well as reducing the presence of infected snails. For example, providing information and education about the risks of schistosomiasis, and promoting behaviors that reduce exposure to infected water, can help to reduce the severity of the disease.Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering both environmental and social factors in understanding and addressing the risk of infectious diseases. By taking a holistic approach that considers the various components of risk, it is possible to develop more effective strategies for preventing and controlling diseases like schistosomiasis. This is crucial for protecting the health and wellbeing of affected communities, and for reducing the burden of infectious diseases globally.
Nigeria has been experiencing increasing annual outbreaks of Lassa fever (LF), a hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV) endemic to West African countries. The World Health Organization has declared LASV as a priority pathogen for accelerated research, with a need for well-characterized animal models of disease and effective countermeasures. A limiting factor in evaluating medical countermeasures against LF is the lack of animal models outside of those based on infection with LASV strain Josiah from Sierra Leone. This study genetically characterizes five recent LASV isolates from the 2018 outbreak in Nigeria and evaluates three of them in vivo. The isolates were closely related and from the same spatial/geographic region of Nigeria, but only one proved lethal in strain 13 guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHP). This isolate exhibited atypical pathogenesis characteristics in the NHP model, most notably respiratory failure. The study suggests that there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in LASV infections in Nigeria, which leads to a multitude of pathogenesis characteristics that could account for differences between subclinical and lethal LF infections. The development of disease models using currently circulating LASV strains in West Africa is critical for the evaluation of potential vaccines and medical countermeasures. LASV has a high degree of genetic diversity that correlates with geographic distribution, and recent studies have highlighted a larger spectrum of LASV pathological signs through in vivo comparisons of isolates from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Mali. The characterization of genetically and geographically diverse LASV isolates in animal models of disease is imperative to understanding the scope of LASV pathogenesis and the possible discovery of a universal vaccine candidate that can be deployed throughout West Africa.
Schistosomiasis, caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma, is a significant public health problem affecting over 260 million people globally, with the majority of cases in Africa. The parasite can cause acute and chronic debilitating diseases and alters hematological and biochemical parameters in humans. This study aimed to evaluate these changes in S. mansoni infected adult patients compared to healthy controls. The study, conducted at Haik Primary Hospital from February to April 2021, recruited 90 infected patients and 90 healthy controls. Results showed that S. mansoni infected patients had a higher prevalence of anemia (23.3%) and thrombocytopenia (26.7%) compared to healthy controls. Additionally, infected patients had significantly lower white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts and higher eosinophil counts compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, liver function tests, including ALT, AST, ALP, and direct bilirubin, were significantly elevated in infected patients, while albumin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly lower. The intensity of infection was also significantly correlated with hematological and biochemical changes. Therefore, screening and treatment of hematological and biochemical abnormalities in S. mansoni infected patients is crucial to prevent schistosomiasis-associated morbidity and mortality.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health issue, affecting over 71 million people worldwide and potentially leading to liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. While direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have high efficacy in HCV treatment, few countries are on track to eliminate HCV as a public health problem by 2030. An effective prophylactic HCV vaccine is needed, and understanding immune responses in HCV-infected individuals can inform vaccine development. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the envelope glycoprotein E2 are associated with delayed disease progression, but many infected individuals have delayed or low-titer anti-E2 antibody responses. A goal of HCV vaccine development is inducing high titers of anti-E2 antibodies, so it's important to define the mechanisms underlying suboptimal antibody responses.A study examining B cell dysfunction in HCV infection detected HCV E2-specific B cells directly ex vivo at multiple acute infection timepoints in 29 HCV-infected subjects. They found that frequencies of activated MBC and tissue-like MBC were increased, and FCRL5 and PD-1 expression was significantly upregulated in sE2+ rMBC and sE2+ actMBC. These expression patterns may limit anti-E2 antibody production in vivo. Strategies targeting these molecules could potentially generate higher titers of protective antibodies against HCV or other pathogens. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of B cell dysfunction in HCV infection and its implications for vaccine development.
