Acyltransferase family 3 (AT3) domain-containing proteins are found in all domains of life and are involved in acylating a wide range of extracytoplasmic and surface bacterial polysaccharides. These proteins have been studied primarily in bacteria, where they play crucial roles in various processes such as symbiosis, resistance to viruses and antimicrobials, and biosynthesis of antibiotics. Despite their importance, the structure and mechanism of these proteins are largely unknown. A recent study used evolutionary co-variance analysis to build a computational model of the structure of a bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB, revealing a novel fold for the AT3 domain that is stable in the membrane. The AT3 domain contains 10 transmembrane helices forming a large cytoplasmic cavity lined by residues essential for function. Molecular dynamics simulations support a model where the acyl-coA donor spans the membrane, enabling OafB to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface. The SGNH domain, which is often fused to the AT3 domain, is mobile and can both accept acyl-groups from the AT3 and then reach beyond the membrane to reach acceptor substrates. This new general model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could abrogate critical functions of bacterial pathogens.
Honey bees make rapid and accurate decisions when choosing flowers for nectar or pollen, and the speed and accuracy of their decisions are influenced by the quality and reliability of evidence. A study using a controlled flight arena found that honey bees' decision-making abilities are comparable to those of primates, with acceptance responses being more accurate and sensitive to changes in evidence and reward likelihood. A model of the minimally sufficient circuitry for these decision-making capacities was developed and found to be neurobiologically plausible, with potential applications in robotics. Signal detection theory was used to understand how bees make decisions, with acceptance and rejection choices both being important for decision-making. Sequential sampling models, which assume that sensory information is noisy but evidence for different options accumulates over time, were found to be influential in neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. Investigation of the neural mechanisms of choice in primates revealed interacting neural systems for the evaluation of different options and the selection of a choice, involving the frontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the frontal and parietal cortices. However, smaller brains, like those of honey bees, must make effective decisions with fewer neurons. To explore this, a study of honey bee foraging decisions found that bees' acceptance responses were more accurate than rejection responses, but reducing available evidence reduced the capacity of bees to distinguish between correct and incorrect options. Rejection accuracy was more influenced by reward likelihood than available evidence. The study also found that acceptance responses were more accurate than rejection responses, and bees made correct acceptances faster than incorrect ones. Response times were longer in the reduced evidence test, indicating that bees struggled to distinguish the correct and incorrect options. Overall, acceptance behavior was found to be very accurate and therefore very sensitive to available evidence, while rejection behavior was less accurate and less sensitive to changes in evidence.
Metformin, a biguanide and first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has been associated with decreased incidence of cancer and aging-related diseases in humans, and extends lifespan in various organisms. Its molecular pathways, however, are not fully understood. A recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans found that biguanides, including metformin, extend lifespan by stimulating ether lipid biogenesis through the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery, which is necessary for lifespan extension in multiple genetic longevity paradigms. Overexpression of a single key ether lipid biosynthetic enzyme, fard-1/FAR1, is sufficient to promote lifespan extension. Ether lipids are required for activation of longevity-promoting, metabolic stress defenses downstream of the conserved transcription factor skn-1/Nrf. These findings suggest that the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery is a novel therapeutic target to promote healthy aging. Ether lipids are a major structural component of cell membranes, involved in maintaining membrane fluidity, promoting membrane fusion and cellular signaling, regulating cell differentiation, and reducing oxidative stress. Deficiencies in ether lipid biogenesis result in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), a rare genetic disorder with skeletal and facial abnormalities, psychomotor retardation, and early death. Ether lipids contain a fatty alcohol conjugated to the glycerol backbone at the sn-1 position via an ether linkage, and have a unique biosynthetic pathway involving enzymes associated with the membranes of peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. Loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding enzymes required for ether lipid biosynthesis shorten worm lifespan, and RNAi knockdowns of these genes confer resistance to metformin-induced growth inhibition and lifespan extension. Biguanides do not require ether lipid biosynthesis to promote lifespan extension, but phenformin may promote synthesis of one or more ether lipids. Phenformin treatment results in a significant increase in alkenyl ether lipids in wild-type animals, whereas no such increase is evident in drug-treated fard-1 worms. Phosphatidylethanolamine ether lipid abundances were extremely low in fard-1, acl-7, and ads-1 mutants and unchanged by phenformin treatment, unlike in wild-type animals. These data indicate that phenformin treatment leads to increased abundance of multiple ether lipid species in C. elegans. FARD-1, the C. elegans ortholog of human fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1), is expressed in the intestine and localizes near structures resembling lipid droplets. However, phenformin does not alter the number of lipid droplets that are surrounded by FARD-1 or its distribution around lipid droplets. Expression of mRNAs encoding FARD-1, ACL-7, and ADS-1 decreased or remained unchanged upon treatment with biguanide via quantitative RT-PCR, suggesting that ether lipids are not increased in phenformin treatment through a transcriptional mechanism. Peroxisomal protein targeting disruption impairs phenformin’s pro-longevity benefit, indicating that the peroxisome is an essential site of ether lipid production in biguanide action. Fatty acid desaturases and elongases contribute mechanistically to biguanide-mediated lifespan extension, with RNAi knockdown of four genes involved in producing fatty acids 18–20 carbons in length with three or more double bonds mitigating phenformin-driven lifespan extension. These findings suggest the possibility that alterations in ether lipid levels may be involved in aging and longevity in humans.
In this study, researchers aimed to understand the relationships between bacteria in gut microbiomes and how they affect host health. Gut microbiomes are diverse and dynamic communities with various ecological relationships, such as mutualism, competition, parasitism, and predation. These relationships impact various biological processes that affect host health, including metabolism, toxin processing, and the production of physiologically important compounds.The study used a multinomial logistic-normal modeling framework to analyze 5534 samples from 56 baboon hosts over 13 years. The researchers inferred thousands of correlations in bacterial abundance in individual baboons and tested the degree to which bacterial abundance correlations are 'universal' across hosts. They also compared these patterns to two human data sets.The findings suggest that most bacterial correlations are weak, negative, and universal across hosts, with shared correlation patterns dominating over host-specific correlations by almost twofold. Hosts sharing similar bacterial correlation patterns also had similar microbiome taxonomic compositions and tended to be genetic relatives. The study found that universality in baboons was similar to that in human infants and stronger than one data set from human adults. Bacterial families that showed universal correlations in human infants were often universal in baboons.Understanding the universality of bacterial associations across hosts can have implications for microbiome personalization, community assembly, and stability, and for designing microbiome interventions to improve host health. The study highlights the need for further research to elucidate the ecological relationships between bacteria in gut microbiomes and their impact on host health.
Gamma oscillations in the brain are believed to underlie cognitive processes by shaping the formation of transient neuronal partnerships on a millisecond scale, and are coupled to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas. A study on the piriform (olfactory) cortex of awake mice found that respiration drives gamma oscillations in this region, which correlate with local feedback inhibition and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. These oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. They locally segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. Gamma oscillations have been widely studied and are believed to be critical for various cognitive functions such as sensory processing, memory, navigation, and conscious awareness. They modulate spiking activity and shape the formation of transient neuronal partnerships, and ultimately emerge from synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. However, despite the initial evidence for their underlying principles being general, gamma oscillations are not a monolithic entity but actually encompass a diversity of rhythms observed experimentally. This warrants studying the mechanisms and functions of these oscillations in specific brain regions in vivo. Gamma oscillations usually appear nested within slower rhythms, a phenomenon known as cross-frequency coupling, and regarding respiration-entrained brain rhythms, it is worth noting that they depend on nasal airflow and are not a consequence of the respiratory pattern generation in the brainstem. Therefore, it seems likely that respiration-entrained gamma activity arises from local computations driven by sensory inputs sampled at each breath and thus plays a major role in cognition. A promising area to study this hypothesis is the piriform cortex, which constitutes the primary olfactory area in the rodent brain and exhibits prominent gamma oscillations.
The simultaneous replication of chromosome domains is essential for eukaryotic genome function, but the mechanisms determining which domains replicate early or late in different cell types are not fully understood. Intercalary heterochromatin domains replicate very late and are underreplicated in both diploid chromosomes and endoreplicating polytene chromosomes. Drosophila's SUUR protein, a SNF2-related factor, is responsible for locus-specific underreplication of polytene chromosomes. SUUR negatively regulates DNA replication fork progression, and a new method, MS-Enabled Rapid protein Complex Identification (MERCI), was developed to isolate a stable stoichiometric native complex, SUMM4, which includes SUUR and a chromatin boundary protein, Mod(Mdg4)-67. Mod(Mdg4) stimulates SUUR ATPase activity and is required for the normal spatiotemporal distribution of SUUR in vivo. SUUR and Mod(Mdg4)-6
The study focused on clarifying the relationship between accelerated biological age and child developmental outcomes in European school-age children. The concept of accelerated biological age in children and its relationship to development remains unclear, and this study aimed to address this gap in understanding. The research was conducted on a population of 1173 children aged between 5 and 12 years from study centers in the UK, France, Spain, Norway, Lithuania, and Greece. The study measured telomere length, DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, and metabolites using various techniques. The Horvath’s skin and blood clock was used to assess DNA methylation age, while novel blood transcriptome and ‘immunometabolic’ clocks were also derived and tested in a subset of children.The study found that transcriptome and immunometabolic clocks predicted chronological age well, while higher birthweight was associated with greater immunometabolic Δ age, smoke exposure with greater DNA methylation Δ age, and high family affluence with longer telomere length. Accelerated immunometabolic age was associated with better working memory and reduced inattentiveness, while DNA methylation Δ age was associated with greater inattentiveness and poorer externalizing behaviors. Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors. The study concluded that biological aging is a multi-faceted process in children, and adiposity is an essential correlate of accelerated biological aging. Patterns of associations suggested that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development, while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging.The field of geroscience proposes that biological aging drives the physiological deterioration that is the root of multiple age-related health conditions, and understanding the process of biological aging and developing markers to accurately assess biological age in individuals holds great promise for public health and biomedical research. Telomere length and DNA methylation-based clocks have been widely used as biological age markers, and recent studies have developed clocks using transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome data. However, these clocks are weakly correlated with each other, suggesting that each clock captures different facets of biological aging. While biological age in adults is intuitively understood as an overall indicator of general health and resilience, the conceptual interpretation of biological age acceleration in children is much less clear. Child development and aging may be considered opposing processes, but various theoretical frameworks link the two processes. Horvath’s DNA methylation clock is currently the only clock trained to predict age throughout the lifespan, and many of the clock’s CpGs are in genomic regions known to regulate development and differentiation. However, unlike life-course models of physical function, the level of DNA methylation at the clock’s CpGs changes in a predictable, unidirectional manner throughout the life-course, albeit at a much faster rate during childhood. This continuous molecular readout suggests that processes directing development are at least indirectly related to the detrimental processes in later-life and is consistent with quasi-programmed theories of aging such as antagonistic pleiotropy, whereby molecular functions that promote development inadvertently lead to aging in later life. Therefore, some authors have suggested that DNA methylation-based age acceleration may be beneficial during childhood, reflecting greater physical maturity and build-up of biological capital. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding biological aging in children and the potential for developing markers to accurately assess biological age in children to inform interventions that slow physiological decline and reduce the risk of chronic disease and disability in later life.
This summary discusses the genetic component of asthma and its heterogeneous nature, which contributes to the difficulty in identifying specific genetic associations. Twin studies estimate the heritability of asthma to be ~60-70%, and various genes have been identified through candidate gene association studies, family-based genome-wide linkage analyses, and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, only a small proportion of the heritability is accounted for, and this may be due to gene-environment interactions and asthma heterogeneity. Most GWASs use a broad definition of 'doctor-diagnosed asthma', which dilutes genetic signals by not considering asthma heterogeneity. A study aimed to identify genetic associates of childhood wheezing phenotypes by conducting a multivariate GWAS meta-analysis of wheezing phenotypes derived using unbiased analysis of data collected from birth to 18 years in 9568 individuals from five UK birth cohorts. The study identified 44 independent SNPs associated with early-onset persistent, 25 with pre-school remitting, 33 with mid-childhood remitting, and 32 with late-onset wheeze. A novel locus on chr9q21.13, close to annexin 1 (ANXA1), was associated exclusively with early-onset persistent wheeze, and the risk allele (T) of rs75260654 was shown to confer a reduction in ANXA1 expression. In a murine model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway disease, anxa1 protein expression increased and anxa1 mRNA was significantly induced in lung tissue following HDM exposure, and loss of anxa1 resulted in heightened airway hyperreactivity and Th2 inflammation upon allergen challenge. This study suggests that targeting this pathway in persistent disease may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect.
Intercropping, or growing multiple crop species together, can increase agricultural sustainability by capitalizing on positive biodiversity-productivity relationships. However, current intercropping practices often use commercial seeds bred for maximal productivity in monocultures, which may limit the benefits of crop diversity on yield. A study examining annual crop systems found that plant-plant interactions among annual crops shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when the plants were growing in the same community type as their parents did in the previous two generations. This shift in plant-plant interactions led to increased overyielding in mixtures with a common coexistence history, particularly in fertilized conditions. The study also observed character convergence between species sharing the same coexistence history for two generations, with crops converging towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content. These findings suggest the potential of targeted cultivars to increase complementarity of species in intercropping, which could be achieved through specific breeding for mixtures. This has implications for diversified agriculture and highlights the importance of considering the evolutionary potential of plant-plant interactions in diverse communities for the diversification of agricultural systems.
"This summary discusses the use of ""transparent games,"" a setup where two agents, human or non-human primates, engage in game-theoretical tasks on a shared transparent touchscreen display. This setup was used to compare human and macaque pairs in a transparent version of the coordination game ""Bach-or-Stravinsky."" Researchers found that human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking, while macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination. However, after training with a human confederate, two monkeys learned to coordinate dynamically, indicating that dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans. The study also highlights the importance of action visibility in promoting the emergence and maintenance of coordination in dyadic settings. The importance of coordination in primate social groups is emphasized, as it helps maintain cohesion, avoid conflicts, and achieve individual and joint action goals. Game theory offers a framework to investigate dyadic social interactions and the evolution of coordination. The Stag Hunt, Prisoner's Dilemma, and Conflict games are discussed as examples of non-zero-sum 2x2 games that require coordination or anti-coordination. The ""Battle of the Sexes"" or ""Bach-or-Stravinsky"" game is introduced as a type of game that emphasizes the coordination of either of two options, offering an interesting opportunity for studying social interactions in nonhuman primates. The study compares the behavior of humans and rhesus macaques in a transparent version of an iterated movement-based BoS game, finding that both species adapted their strategies during action visibility compared to opaque choices."
The study of female reproduction can greatly benefit from an in vitro model of human ovarian follicles. Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells, with granulosa cells playing a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. While efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, it is reported that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors (TFs), NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2, is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. These granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, these cells form ovary-like organoids (ovaroids) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system provides unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health. Oogenesis is the central process of female reproduction, yet less is understood about this process in humans relative to other model organisms. This is in part due to difficulties in obtaining samples of human fetal ovaries and the lack of a suitable model system to study human ovarian development in vitro. The potential power of such a system is illustrated by a recent study in mice, which differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) and ovarian-like cells, and combined these cell types to produce oocytes and live offspring. Using mouse fetal ovarian somatic cells, a similar system was published that allowed the development of human PGCLCs to the oogonia stage. However, these mixed-species systems are inadequate for fully modeling human ovarian development. Clearly, the construction of fully human ovarian follicles from pluripotent stem cells could enable new advances in the study of female reproduction, epigenetics, and human development. Ovarian development requires paracrine and juxtacrine interaction between cells from germline and somatic lineages. During embryonic development, the first cells committed to the germline appear at roughly 2-3 weeks post-fertilization (wpf), when primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified from the posterior epiblast in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. After specification, PGCs migrate to the developing gonad and undergo further development into oogonia (in female) or spermatogonia (in male). The expression of the RNA-binding proteins DAZL and DDX4 begins in gonadal PGCs, with DAZL identified as a key factor induced by the gonadal environment that commits PGCs to the germline, restricting pluripotency and inhibiting differentiation to somatic lineages. Previous studies have provided efficient protocols for the differentiation of hiPSCs to DAZL-negative premigratory PGCLCs. However, the only previously reported method that allows human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) to develop to later DAZL-positive stages in vitro is to aggregate them with mouse fetal ovarian or testicular cells, which mimic the environment of the early gonad. The somatic cells of the developing ovary provide crucial support for oogenesis, and proper oogenesis depends on a complex interplay of paracrine signaling between somatic and germline cells. Granulosa cells, which surround and support developing oocytes, participate in endocrine signaling, producing estradiol and progesterone which regulate diverse reproductive functions. Although a few studies have attempted differentiating human pluripotent stem cells to granulosa-like cells through treatment with recombinant signaling proteins, none has resulted in an efficient method, nor has any previous study evaluated their ability to support germ cell development. Therefore, the study aimed to determine a set of TFs that could be used for an efficient, scalable method of generating granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs. The study began by predicting candidate TFs that could direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells and assembled a PiggyBac library by cloning cDNAs into a barcoded destination plasmid. The TFs were expressed under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter, and an hiPSC line with a homozygous knock-in of a T2A-tdTomato reporter at the C-terminus of FOXL2 was engineered to enable identification of granulosa-like cells. The pooled cDNA library was co-electroporated with a PiggyBac transposase expression plasmid, and a population of cells with integrated transposons was selected by treatment with puromycin. In these experiments, the TF expression resulted in a small fraction of FOXL2+ cells, from which gDNA was extracted and sequenced to identify barcodes. Barcodes for NR5A1 were strongly enriched in FOXL2+ cells relative to negative cells, as well as relative to the barcodes in the pre-induced hiPSC population. Other TFs showed more modest barcode enrichment or enrichment in only one condition. These results indicate that NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 are sufficient to induce a granulosa-like phenotype. The gene expression of the granulosa-like cells was examined and compared to hiPSCs, COV434 and KGN ovarian tumor cells, and sorted FOXL2+CD82+ granulosa-like cells from day 5 of a polyclonal differentiation with expression of the previously identified top TFs. In the absence of TF expression, the hiPSCs differentiated into cells expressing mesoderm markers. At day 5 of differentiation, the expression of bipotential gonad and granulosa markers, notably including AMHR2, CD82, FOXL2, FSHR, IGFBP7, KRT19, STAR, and WNT4, was observed. The expression levels were generally comparable to those observed in previously published data from granulosa cells and human fetal gonad. These results demonstrate the successful differentiation of hiPSCs into granulosa-like cells, which have the potential to greatly benefit the study of female reproduction.
The researchers aimed to study the genetic basis of skin color variation in a population with Native American and African ancestry but low European admixture. They analyzed 458 genomes from individuals residing in the Kalinago Territory of the Commonwealth of Dominica, which showed approximately 55% Native American, 32% African, and 12% European genetic ancestry. Skin pigmentation in this population ranged from 20 to 80 melanin units, with an average of 46. Three albino individuals were determined to be homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV of African origin. The derived allele frequencies of SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F were 0.14 and 0.06, with single allele effect sizes of -6 and -4, respectively. However, the responsible hypopigmenting genetic variants in Native American genetic ancestry remain to be identified. The researchers suggest that the genetic basis for lighter skin pigmentation specific to Native American and East Asian populations remains to be found. The study highlights the shared genetic ancestry of East Asians and Native Americans and the likelihood that some light skin color alleles are shared between these populations. The researchers searched for an admixed Native American population with high African but low European admixture and focused on the Kalinago population of Dominica due to their primarily Native American and African genetic ancestry. The study found that the Kalinago population has among the lowest European genetic ancestry (12%) compared to other reported Caribbean Native Americans. The Kalinago population has more Native American and less European genetic ancestry than any other Caribbean population, making it a valuable population for studying Native American light skin color alleles.
Antioxidant intervention and moderate exercise have been considered as essential therapeutic strategies for type 2 diabetes, although they have different mechanisms. Antioxidants reduce cytotoxic ROS and oxidative products, while exercise increases ROS production but also improves cellular mitochondrial function and biogenesis in the diabetic state. AMPK, a 'metabolic master switch', alleviates diabetes symptoms by reducing glycogen synthesis, increasing glycolysis, and promoting glucose absorption in surrounding tissues. The activation of AMPK in the liver is significant for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the blood. Oxidative modification can directly regulate AMPK activity in liver cells, thus activating downstream signaling pathways to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. In a study using a streptozotocin-high fat diet (STZ-HFD) induced type 2 diabetic model (T2DM) in rats, it was found that both antioxidant intervention and exercise could activate AMPK and its downstream pathways, reflecting the threshold of redox balance for diabetes management. The study provides clues for the personalized management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.The study found that after exercise intervention in T2DM rats, ROS-producing enzymes NOX4 and COX2 were further up-regulated, while antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2, GRX1, TRX1, and PRX were also increased, indicating that exercise intervention could activate the antioxidant system. The increase in ROS production did not lead to oxidative damage, suggesting that exercise can promote redox to reach a high level of balance. The antioxidant supplement also started from day-0 to day-28, which decreased the protein carbonylation level and MDA level in the liver, indicating the reduction of oxidation level. Consistently, Glut2, a glucose sensor in the liver, was increased in diabetic liver and decreased after the apocynin supplement, and the postprandial blood glucose, fasting blood glucose, and OGTT were decreased in the apocynin intervention group compared with the diabetic rat group. The exercise group also showed lower postprandial blood glucose and fasting blood glucose levels and OGTT. These studies indicate that the apocynin treatment improved the diabetes through inhibiting ROS level and protein oxidative damage to achieve a low-level redox balance. Moderate exercise-generated ROS promotes activation of AMPK by phosphorylation and reduces blood glucose level, while excessive exercise-generated oxidative stress reduces AMPK expression and exacerbates diabetes.In conclusion, both antioxidant intervention and moderate exercise have been shown to improve blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox state. The AMPK signaling activation, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as sentinel biomarkers, reflecting the threshold of redox balance that is linked to effective glucose control in diabetes. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.
The study introduces a new geometric model that explains the variable escape trajectories (ET) of prey to avoid predation. Previous models predict a single ET, but many species show multiple preferred directions. This study aims to clarify the reasons why animals prefer specific multiple ETs. The new model considers the time required for prey to turn and the predator's position at the end of its attack. The model can explain the observed multiple preferred ETs in fish Pagrus major and produce various patterns of ETs empirically observed in other species. The researchers modified the previous models proposed by Domenici (2002) and Corcoran and Conner (2016) to develop the new model. The new model can be applied to various animals, including fish, terrestrial and benthic species, and aerial animals such as moths escaping from bats. The findings open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.
The development of prime editing (PE) genome engineering technologies offers the potential to simplify the generation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based disease models. PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase and an extended PE guide RNA, which functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. A recent study compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs and found that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs, editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells were achieved, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, the delivery modalities for the PE components were optimized, resulting in up to 13-fold improved editing efficiencies compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. This mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson’s disease in hPSCs. PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs due to its high editing efficiency and precision in introducing heterozygous point mutations.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that accounts for approximately 10% of all hematologic malignancies. The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is used to stratify MM patients into stages I, II, and III, with different outcomes and treatment responses. However, the single-cell gene expression signatures in MM R-ISS stages remain unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the gene expression profiles in normal and R-ISS stage I, II, and III groups using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. The study identified six clusters of plasma cells (PCs) and found that a plasma cluster (PCC18) showing higher expression of the cytotoxic gene NKG7 was present in all groups. The average percentage of NKG7+ population was higher in stage II (8.89%) compared to stage I (2.73%) and stage III (0.58%). The study also identified a malignant PC population with significantly elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA, associated with unfavorable prognosis and EBV infection. Ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) was found to promote proliferation of MM cell lines, suggesting it may serve as a detrimental marker in MM. The proportions of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells decreased along with R-ISS stages, reflecting the plasticity of the tumor immune microenvironment. The study also identified several potential immunotargets such as SIRPA-CD47 and CD74-MIF, respectively. Overall, this study provides an R-ISS-related single-cell MM atlas and reveals the clinical significance of two PC clusters, as well as potential immunotargets in MM progression.
The CRISPR-Cas system is a bacterial and archaeal adaptive immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements such as viruses and plasmids. The system utilizes CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to guide the cleavage of complementary target RNA or DNA. Cas7-11 is a unique Type III CRISPR-Cas system that functions as a single subunit effector, unlike the multi-subunit Class 1 and single-subunit Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems. It encodes a single polypeptide containing four Cas7-like and one Cas11-like segments, making it difficult to distinguish between the two classes. A recent study determined the cryo-EM structure of the active Cas7-11 from Desulfonema ishimotonii (DiCas7-11), which revealed the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. The structure shows that DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form that resembles the backbone of multi-subunit enzymes, but with evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and its free-standing fragment retains most of the activity. The second and third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7 domain has little impact on RNA processing or targeting, suggesting the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool. Overall, Cas7-11 provides a desirable platform to further develop RNA interference and editing tools due to its unique features and functionalities.
The study addresses the need to consider multiple dimensions of biodiversity in addressing global biodiversity loss, specifically focusing on how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity. A tree species x genetic diversity experiment was used to examine the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity on tree productivity, and their relationship with tree functional diversity, soil fungal diversity, and herbivory. The study found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity, and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested. The study suggests that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation, as the interactions between genetic diversity, tree functional diversity, and trophic feedbacks on productivity are complex. Biodiversity is crucial for maintaining ecosystem functioning and nature's contributions to people, with ongoing biodiversity loss being a major concern. Expanding research to consider multiple dimensions of biodiversity can help predict the consequences of biodiversity loss and prioritize the different dimensions of biodiversity in conservation efforts.
Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but tracking single molecules while detecting their interactions remains a challenge. A new method called proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA) has been developed, which allows for the detection of protein-protein interactions and the highlighting of a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. PAPA involves the use of rhodamine dyes, where one fluorophore (the 'sender') can reactivate a second fluorophore (the 'receiver') from a dark state, operating at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). PAPA has been shown to detect the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. This new method provides a way to harness a photophysical property of fluorophores to study molecular interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells, and offers a new tool for studying proteins that function by interacting with other proteins.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of calcium supplementation for improving bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral content (BMC) in young people before the age of 35. The study identified 43 studies involving 7,382 subjects and found moderate certainty of evidence that calcium supplementation was associated with the accretion of BMD and BMC, especially on femoral neck and total body. Subgroup analyses suggested that the improvement of bone at the femoral neck was more pronounced in the peripeak bone mass (PBM) population (20-35 years) than the pre-PBM population (<20 years). The findings suggest that calcium supplementation significantly improves bone mass, implying that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving PBM may be a shift in the window of intervention for osteoporosis. This work was supported by Wenzhou Medical University grant [89219029]. The study of calcium supplementation on bone health in young people is controversial, with some studies showing positive effects on BMD or BMC while others show no association. A recent study found that the age at attainment of peak femoral neck BMD, total hip BMD, and lumbar spine BMD was 20-24 years old in males and 19-20 years old in females, and a plateau is achieved in PBM at approximately 30 years old. Therefore, this study conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of calcium supplementation for improving BMD or BMC in young people before the age of 35. The study included randomized controlled trials that compared calcium or calcium plus vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment, involving participants aged under 35 years at baseline, and providing BMD or BMC data measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry as estimates of bone mass. The study found that calcium supplementation significantly improves bone mass, especially in the femoral neck and total body, in young people. The beneficial effect was maintained for at least 1 year after the intervention but seemed to disappear when the follow-up period exceeded 2 years. Calcium supplementation with vitamin D showed greater beneficial effects on femoral neck BMD and BMC. The study suggests that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving PBM may be a shift in the window of intervention for osteoporosis.
In biological systems, liquid and solid-like biomolecular condensates can contain the same molecules, but their behavior, including movement, elasticity, and viscosity, is different due to distinct physicochemical properties. Phase transitions affect the function of biological condensates, and material properties can be tuned by several factors including temperature, concentration, and valency. However, it is unclear if some factors are more efficient than others at regulating their behavior. Viral infections, such as influenza A virus (IAV), provide a system to study this question as they form condensates de novo as part of their replication programmes. A study using IAV liquid cytosolic condensates, also known as viral inclusions, found that liquid condensate hardening via changes in the valency of its components is more efficient than altering their concentration or temperature. This was demonstrated by hardening liquid IAV inclusions using the known NP oligomerising molecule, nucleozin, both in vitro and in vivo without affecting host proteome abundance or solubility. This study provides a starting point for understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions and may offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies. The spatiotemporal control of reactions in many viral infections is closely tied to the formation of biomolecular condensates that facilitate key steps of viral lifecycles. In IAV infection, this is key for assembling its segmented genome. After export from the nucleus where vRNPs are synthesized, vRNPs reach the cytosol and induce the formation of cytosolic condensates, known as viral inclusions, which are sites dedicated to IAV genome assembly. IAV cytosolic inclusions exhibit liquid properties, providing the first indication that defined material properties are critical for the formation of influenza epidemic and pandemic genomes. The list of viruses utilizing liquid biomolecular condensates is rapidly increasing, and targeting the material properties could constitute a novel antiviral approach. However, compounds targeting condensates have exhibited off-target effects, so a critical advance in condensate disease therapy, including in the case of viral infection, requires defining how to efficiently and specifically target selected biomolecular condensates.
Kinesin-4 is a unique family of kinesin superfamily proteins that inhibits microtubule dynamics, and mutations in kinesin-4 have been linked to several diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of kinesin-4 is unclear due to the difficulty of visualizing its high-resolution structure at the microtubule plus-end. A study focused on KLP-12, a C. elegans kinesin-4 ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, revealed that it is essential for proper length control of C. elegans axons and its motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in vitro. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin showed that KLP-12 modulates the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics. KIF21A and KIF21B, mammalian orthologs of KLP-12, regulate axon length by inhibiting microtubule polymerization, suggesting that KLP-12 may also inhibit microtubule polymerization to restrict axon length. In vitro TIRF assays showed that KLP-12 possesses a suppression effect on microtubule growth rates similar to other members of the kinesin-4 family proteins, especially to KIF21A/B. The KLP-12 monomeric motor domain binds to the microtubule lattice and the growing microtubule plus-end and activates its ATPase, achieving microtubule motility and growing microtubule stabilization. The structure of the GTP-tubulin-KLP-12-DARPin complex was solved at 2.9 Å resolution, revealing that KLP-12 forms an ATP conformation and the back door between switch I Arg218 and switch II Glu266 is closed, representing the pre-hydrolysis state during ATP hydrolysis. The structure of KLP-12 is very similar to KIF4 among the kinesin-4 family members but has moderate structural differences from KIF7 and KIF2C, reflecting the conserved mechanisms of microtubule dynamics inhibition among kinesin-4 motors.
Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) are crucial for reproduction, as they generate daughter cells that develop into nurse cells and oocytes. GSCs maintain their identity through self-renewal, while their daughters differentiate by increasing pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification, a mechanism likely to suppress transposable element activity. This differentiation process resembles the development of the totipotent zygote. The zygote launches embryonic development from a totipotent chromatin state, and pluripotent cell lines provide valuable material for analyzing the gene expression, chromatin, and metabolic states that drive stem cells to diverse differentiated derivatives. Highly potent stem cells, including GSCs, show unusual cycling characteristics, express genes in a variable manner, and exhibit 'bivalent' chromatin marks. Drosophila female GSCs offer a promising system for studying totipotency maintenance and differentiation. New female germ cells continuously arise downstream from GSCs located within the adult germarium and develop into ovarian follicles ordered by age within ovarioles. GSC daughters divide synchronously to build 16-cell cysts that specify an oocyte and 15 nurse cells, which traverse meiotic prophase, become associated with somatic follicle cells, and leave the germarium as stage 2 (S2) follicles. Follicle development increases the oocyte volume to more than 10,000 times that of a GSC. Previous studies show that aspects of oocyte development have been conserved between Drosophila, mouse, and other animals. Gene expression during oogenesis has been characterized in purified GSCs, downstream follicles, and single ovarian cells or nuclei. Early germ cells express conserved germline genes (CGGs) encoding essential Piwi-piRNA pathway components that repress transposon transcription and promote transposon mRNA slicing and piRNA amplification in nuage. Many important steps in germ cell differentiation are controlled at the translational level, such as the GSC differentiation factor Bam stimulating exit from the stem cell state by repressing high-level ribosome production in the nucleolus and by lifting the Nanos-controlled translation block of differentiation genes. GSCs and developing follicles sense environmental nutrients using insulin/IGF and steroid signaling to maximize oocyte output. An important regulator of resource adaptation is Myc, whose translation becomes derepressed as early as the four-cell cyst and increases further under favorable conditions. Myc plays an essential role by controlling hundreds of target genes that regulate both ribosome production and metabolism.
Biological rhythms, controlled by circadian clocks, are widespread in eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, regulating development and environmental responses. In sunflowers, the circadian clock tightly synchronizes the anthesis of hundreds of florets daily, promoting pollinator visits and reproductive success. Circadian clock regulation occurs through cell-autonomous transcriptional-translational feedback loops, creating rhythms of gene expression. These rhythms are stably entrained to environmental cues, persist in free-running conditions, are temperature-compensated, and gate certain biological processes to specific times of day.In sunflowers, the circadian clock controls the timing of late-stage floret development, or anthesis, with up to hundreds of florets undergoing simultaneous maturation in discrete ring-like pseudowhorls. The circadian clock acts in concert with environmental response pathways to synchronize anthesis, generating spatial patterns on the developing capitulum disk. Delays in the phase of floral anthesis delay morning pollinator visits, while disruption of circadian rhythms in floral organ development causes loss of pseudowhorl formation and large reductions in pollinator visits.In both plants and animals, internal body clocks can generate serially repeated organs, such as the sunflower's capitulum with individual florets arranged in spiral patterns. In vertebrate embryos, a molecular 'segmentation clock' divides the developing body axis into discrete blocks of cells, while in plants, a 'root clock' generates a temporally oscillating developmental signal for lateral roots along the primary root axis.The circadian clock in eukaryotes coordinates development on daily and seasonal time scales, integrating environmental cues such as day length and temperature to time the transition to reproductive stages. Circadian clocks control the timing of reproductive development, allowing organisms to distinguish between long and short days of different seasons. In plants, the circadian system mediates the effects of day length during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, usually referred to as flowering time, and regulates daily aspects of floral development, such as coordinating daily rhythms in scent emission and floral opening and closing with pollinator activity.In conclusion, the circadian clock plays a crucial role in sunflower development and reproductive success, controlling the timing of anthesis and daily aspects of floral development. Through cell-autonomous transcriptional-translational feedback loops, the circadian clock regulates biological timing, ensuring stable entrainment to environmental cues, persistence in free-running conditions, temperature-compensation, and gating of certain biological processes to specific times of day.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has sensory neurons that enable it to perceive temperature and adjust its defenses in response to the threat of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by pathogenic bacteria. At high temperatures, C. elegans preemptively induces the expression of specific H2O2 defenses in response to the perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons, which communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical. The study of C. elegans' defense mechanism against H2O2 is important because H2O2 is a common reactive chemical that organisms face on the microbial battlefield, and its damaging effects on biomolecules required for life increase with temperature. The temperature-dependent regulation of peroxide defenses in C. elegans is directed by the AFD sensory neurons, which repress the expression of the INS-39 insulin/IGF1 hormone and alleviate inhibition by insulin/IGF1 signaling of the nematodes’ peroxide defenses at high temperature. This allows the nematodes to better cope with H2O2 produced by the pathogenic bacterium E. faecium.
Class switch recombination (CSR) is a crucial process in the adaptive immune system, generating distinct antibody isotypes through a series of tightly regulated steps. Defects in CSR are associated with autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis. Transcription is required for CSR, recruiting the cytidine deaminase AID to form DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which is an essential step in CSR. However, the impact of R loops on DSB formation and repair during CSR remains unclear. R loops, three-stranded nucleotide structures formed during transcription, have been observed at switch regions, and their role in CSR is confounding.In this study, the researchers investigated the impact of R loops on DSB repair during CSR using mouse knockout models of two key enzymes implicated in R loop removal, senataxin (SETX) and a subunit of the heterotrimeric nuclease RNase H2. They found that loss of both SETX and RNase H2 activity exhibits increased R loops specifically at the Sμ switch region in resting or activated B cells, correlating with enhanced genome instability at the heavy-chain locus. Increased mutations and insertion events were also observed in SETX- and RNase H2-deficient B cells by molecular analysis of switch junctions. These findings suggest that timely R loop removal at switch regions by a SETX/RNase H2 mechanism during CSR suppresses error-prone end-joining and translocation formation at IgH.In summary, this study provides insights into the role of R loops in CSR and the impact of R loop removal on DSB repair during this process. The findings suggest that timely R loop removal at switch regions by a SETX/RNase H2 mechanism during CSR suppresses error-prone end-joining and translocation formation at IgH. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate CSR is crucial for developing strategies to prevent autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis associated with defects in CSR.
A mosaic-type trimeric form of the spike receptor-binding domain (mos-tri-RBD) has been designed as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate to better control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the rapidly growing breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2, especially the Omicron variant. The mos-tri-RBD carries key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants and has been shown to elicit potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against not only Omicron but also other immune-evasive variants in rat tests. The neutralizing antibody ID50 titers induced by mos-tri-RBD were substantially higher than those elicited by homo-tri-RBD or the BIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). The SARS-CoV-2 has been continuously evolving, with five strains classified as variants of concern (VOCs) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Among them, the Alpha and Delta variants have exhibited slightly and moderately less sensitivity to neutralization by serum from vaccinated individuals, while the Beta and Gamma variants have shown significantly greater immune escape capability. The Omicron variant, first detected in Botswana and reported from South Africa, has spread rapidly to more than 95 countries and is considered to be associated with the sharp rise of infection cases in multiple provinces in South Africa. Preliminary evidence indicates that this variant may be more transmissible and may have a higher reinfection risk than other VOCs. The Omicron variant carries 15 mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein, which is the immunodominant target of neutralizing antibodies. Compared with other VOCs, the substantially more mutations, as well as their important locations for antibody binding, may enable Omicron to escape the immune protection offered by previous infection or vaccination. The extensive immune-escape capability of Omicron and other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants from previous infections and vaccinations raises an urgent need for developing effective broad-spectrum vaccines against these immune-evasive variants.
Malaria, caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, results in over 600,000 deaths annually, with the majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Antimalarial drug resistance, including to front-line artemisinin and partner drugs, is a significant global health threat. The Plasmodium falciparum parasite digests host hemoglobin in red blood cells to obtain essential amino acids for growth, and enzymes such as PfA-M17 play a crucial role in this process. A study has shown that PfA-M17 is essential for parasite survival, as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth, and its inhibition leads to parasite death. Additionally, loss of PfA-M17 results in parasites exhibiting multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage. Furthermore, the peptides accumulating after the depletion of PfA-M17 are likely to originate from hemoglobin, indicating that PfA-M17 plays a role in the final stages of its digestion. These findings suggest that PfA-M17 is a potential novel drug target for malaria treatment, particularly in the context of emerging drug resistance. Further research is necessary to develop and optimize PfA-M17 inhibitors for therapeutic use.
The study of hematopoiesis, the process by which mature blood and immune cells are generated, has been well-studied for over a century. Hematopoiesis is classically modeled as a stepwise differentiation process, with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at the core, which have self-renewal capacity and give rise to functionally and phenotypically homogeneous progenitor populations. However, recent single-cell studies have revealed heterogeneity within the HSC compartment and within progenitor populations, leading to the view of early hematopoiesis as a continuous landscape composed of undifferentiated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with a variable degree of priming toward specific lineages. During aging, the hematopoietic system undergoes various changes such as an increase in the relative number of HSCs, a loss of repopulation ability, a decrease in total bone marrow cellularity, a loss of lymphocyte production and a skewing toward myeloid differentiation, an increase in the number of platelet primed HSCs, and a general loss of immune function. These phenotypic changes are due to an increased rate of random mutations in hematopoietic progenitors, clonal hematopoiesis, transcriptional dysregulation, and epigenetic modifications. Aging is associated with a higher risk of developing myeloid malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and predisposition to transformation into acute myeloid leukemia.In this study, the researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize an enriched population of human HSPCs obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals. They identified changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging and differences in their functionality. Trajectory inference revealed altered gene expression dynamics accompanying cell differentiation, which could explain aging-associated changes in hematopoiesis. They also focused on key regulators of transcription by constructing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and detected regulons that were specifically active in elderly individuals. By comparing transcriptional programs and GRNs regulating normal HSPCs and MDS HSPCs, they identified regulons that were specifically active in MDS cases, suggesting a role of these transcription factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. The study demonstrates that the combination of single-cell technologies with computational analysis tools can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with perturbations such as aging and malignant transformation, and the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients.
The study investigates the role of AmTYR1, a tyramine receptor, in latent inhibition, a form of non-associative learning in honey bees. Individual honey bees from the same colony differ in their degree of latent inhibition, and these differences have a genetic basis. Specifically, a Quantitative Trait Locus for latent inhibition was mapped to a region of the genome containing the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Disruption of Amtyr1 signaling either pharmacologically or through RNAi qualitatively changes the expression of latent inhibition, suggesting that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the central nervous system (CNS). Electrophysiological recordings from the brain during pharmacological blockade support this model. These findings identify a distinct Amtyr1-based modulatory pathway for this type of non-associative learning and propose a model for how Amtyr1 acts as a gain control to modulate Hebbian plasticity at defined synapses in the CNS. This has implications for understanding the strategies colonies use to explore for and exploit pollen and nectar resources. Additionally, behavioral experiments involving treatment with the tyramine receptor antagonist yohimbine or Dicer-substrate small interfering (Dsi) RNA of the receptor support the hypothesis that Amtyr1 affects expression of latent inhibition without affecting excitatory conditioning. The results suggest that AmTYR1 modulates inhibition involved in identified inhibitory processes in the antennal lobes and/or the mushroom bodies, specifically preventing the inhibition from becoming too strong and possibly keeping it at a set point between very strong and very weak.
The study describes a novel, non-invasive imaging technique that allows for real-time identification of specific cell types within live tissues, using the endogenous autofluorescence signatures of the metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD. This methodology was used to distinguish all seven airway epithelial cell types in mouse tracheal explants simultaneously, and to observe dynamic secretory cell-associated antigen passages (SAPs) in response to cholinergic stimulation. This approach has several advantages over traditional techniques, such as avoiding the use of fluorescent genetic reporters, which are cumbersome and only allow the study of a limited number of cell types at a time. Additionally, this method can avoid pitfalls associated with the use of ostensibly cell type-specific markers, which can be altered by clinically relevant physiologic stimuli. The study also demonstrates the utility of this methodology in revealing real-time physiology, identifying SAPs, and tracking cellular dynamics in a non-destructive fashion, which is essential for studying long-term processes or the effect of multiple serial stimuli. Overall, this novel imaging technique has the potential to permit the study of physiologically relevant processes that are currently hidden from view and to provide new insights into the cellular dynamics and interactions within live tissues.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and the inability of adult hearts to regenerate after injury is a major factor. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, but its role in heart regeneration is unclear. To study m6A function in heart regeneration, researchers modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo. They found that knockdown of Mettl3 increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice. Conversely, Mettl3 overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice. Further analysis identified Fgf16 as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification during postnatal heart regeneration. Mettl3 negatively regulates Fgf16 mRNA expression in an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent manner, and the silencing of Fgf16 suppresses the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. However, the overexpression of a mutated Fgf16, in which the m6A consensus sequence was mutated, significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16. Therefore, Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces Fgf16 mRNA levels through an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent pathway, thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. These findings suggest that m6A modification plays a critical role in heart regeneration and may provide a potential target for the treatment of heart failure.
The risk of developing second primary cancers (SPCs) increases after the diagnosis and treatment of first primary cancers (FPCs). A pan-cancer association study was conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for non-Hispanic whites, estimating the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of SPCs in cancer survivors based on the incidence in the general population. The causal effect was evaluated using two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) in the UK Biobank and robust analysis (radial MR and Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates or CAUSE). The study found 11 significant cross-correlations among different cancers after harmonizing SIR and MR results, but only 4 were confirmed by MR to have a robust causal relationship. Patients initially diagnosed with oral pharyngeal cancer had an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Ovary cancer was identified as a risk factor for soft tissue cancer, and kidney cancer was likely to cause the development of lung cancer and myeloma. The profound mechanisms need to be studied in the future. This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai Youth Talent Support Program, intramural grant of The University of Hong Kong to Dr. Rong Na, and Shanghai Sailing Program to Dr. Da Huang. The global incidence of cancers has rapidly grown, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10.0 million deaths in 2020. Prolonged survival of cancers has increased the possibility of individuals being diagnosed with a second primary cancer during follow-up. Increased risks of SPCs were observed in many types of cancer as the FPCs. While there is a strong association between FPC and SPC, whether there is any underlying causal relationship is unknown or if the association observed is due to potential confounders such as aging. The study aimed to perform a pan-cancer association study in the SEER and interpret the underlying causal relationship via Mendelian Randomization approaches using genetic variants in a large population cohort (UK Biobank). The study may help understand critical questions in clinical practice about who should be more careful of the second primaries and optimize the treatment for patients' prognosis and survivorship.
In economic decision-making, individuals choose between items based on their perceived value, and this process often involves shifting gaze between the available options. Recent studies suggest that these shifts in gaze can influence choice, with a bias towards items viewed first, last, or for the longest duration. To investigate the mechanism behind this, a study developed a value-based choice task for macaque monkeys, which captured the essential features of human paradigms where gaze biases have been observed. The monkeys exhibited gaze biases similar to those in humans, which were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework. This suggests a common mechanism for gaze-related choice biases across species, opening the way for studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior. Economic decisions are often made by primates, including humans, by evaluating available options through eye movements. Over the past decade, studies have shown an association between gaze and value-based choices in humans, with people more likely to select the first item viewed, the last item viewed before deciding, and the item viewed for the longest time. Gaze plays an active role in the decision process, making simply viewing a given option more likely to be chosen. However, the neural mechanisms linking gaze and economic choice are not fully known. To address this, a study developed a novel behavioral paradigm for macaque monkeys that captures the essential features of tasks previously used in humans, determining whether monkeys exhibit gaze-based choice biases similar to those of humans. The monkeys were trained to perform a value-based decision task, using eye movements to view the choice options and a manual response to indicate their decision. The monkeys were more likely to choose the first item viewed, the last item viewed before deciding, and the items that received more overall gaze time. These findings suggest a common mechanism for gaze-related choice biases across species, opening the way for studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.
The dietary habits of phytophagous insects show a wide range of niche breadths, with most species specializing on a few host plants and some displaying a much wider niche breadth. A study on the fruit fly Drosophila suzukii, which has an exceptional diet breadth of over 20 plant families, aimed to investigate whether generalist individuals have a single physiological response to various diets or exhibit specific responses to these diets. The researchers used an untargeted metabolomics approach to characterize the metabolic impact of various fruit-based diets on D. suzukii and found that, while biochemically different fruits resulted in some differences in the metabolomes of the flies that consumed them, the differences were relatively small. The flies' metabolomes clustered together, away from the fruits, indicating metabolic generalism over multi-host metabolic specialism. This suggests that a generalist species may metabolize different diets in a similar, generic way, rather than showing specific pathways to metabolize unique compounds of different diets. Additionally, the study found that the flies' diets could be readily inferred from their metabolomes, indicating that quantitative hallmarks of diet consumption could be detected in the flies. Overall, these results support the view that dietary generalism may emerge from a passive, opportunistic use of various resources, and may favor the later evolution of new diet specializations.
Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, evolved from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis approximately 6000-7000 years ago and transitioned from a faecal-oral route of transmission to an arthropod-borne one. A critical step in this evolution was the acquisition of the capacity for biofilm-dependent blockage of the flea foregut, enabling transmission by flea bite. This was facilitated by multiple genetic changes, including the pseudogenization of rcsA and a frameshift mutation in rcsD. The rcsD mutation results in the production of a small protein containing the C-terminal RcsD histidine-phosphotransferase domain (RcsD-Hpt) and full-length RcsD. The frameshift mutation in rcsD followed the emergence of rcsA pseudogenization and further altered the canonical Rcs phosphorylation signal cascade, fine-tuning biofilm production to be conducive with retention of the pgm locus in modern lineages of Y. pestis. These genetic changes enabled Y. pseudotuberculosis to form biofilms in the proventriculus of fleas, promoting a flea-borne transmission modality. The Rcs phosphorelay system, a non-orthodox two-component signal transduction system, consists of a hybrid sensor kinase RcsC, the phosphotransfer protein RcsD, and a response regulator RcsB. In Enterobacteriaceae, the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF senses OM- and peptidoglycan-related stress, and the inner membrane protein IgaA relays these signals to RcsD, which activates the Rcs phosphorelay system. Autophosphorylated RcsC transfers a phosphate group to a conserved histidine residue in the C-terminal histidine-phosphotransferase (HPt) domain of RcsD, which is finally transferred to RcsB. Phosphorylated RcsB acts either alone or in combination with auxiliary proteins to regulate expression of target genes. Functional RcsA works in concert with RcsB as a heterodimer to inhibit Y. pseudotuberculosis biofilm formation. In Y. pestis, RcsA was disrupted by acquiring a 30 bp repeat insertion sequence, leading to enhanced capacity for biofilm formation. RcsD in Y. pestis is a putative pseudogene due to a 1 bp deletion, but it retains a limited ability to modulate biofilm formation in vitro. The rcsD frameshift mutation alters Rcs signal transduction, subsequently modulating the expression of dozens of genes and the capacity for biofilm formation in Y. pestis, representing an important step in the emergence of ubiquitous branches of Y. pestis that can capably maintain plague outbreaks.
The peer review process is a crucial step in ensuring the quality of scientific research, but its subjectivity has raised concerns. A study was conducted to investigate this issue by examining over 500 peer review reports from 200 neuroscience papers published in 2022-2023. The reviews were analyzed using OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT, which demonstrated superior performance in language use analysis compared to traditional models. The results showed that most reviews were favorable (89.8%), and language use was mostly polite (99.8%). However, there was high variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. Additionally, female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, with potential causes discussed. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts and identifies areas of concern in scientific peer review, underscoring the importance of transparent peer review in studying equitability in scientific publishing.
The study describes the use of mouse models of hepatic metastases to show that continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of interferon-alpha (IFNα) controls colorectal cancer (CRC) invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs), specifically liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The mechanism involves the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by LSECs defenestration, extracellular matrix, and glycocalyx deposition, which strengthens the liver vascular barrier, impairs CRC trans-sinusoidal migration, and does not require a direct action on tumor cells, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes, or liver immune cells. The therapy supports the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver. CRC is a common and deadly cancer, and despite surgical resection and adjuvant therapies, up to 50% of patients develop life-threatening liver metastases. The use of perioperative immunotherapies in CRC patients undergoing surgical resection may represent a unique treatment window to prevent metastatic colonization and control minimal residual disease. IFNα has multiple antitumor effects, including direct inhibition of cancer cell growth, angiogenesis, sustained upregulation of major histocompatibility complexes, and induction of innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses. However, systemic administration of IFNα has shown limited clinical efficacy due to its short plasma half-life and systemic side effects. Strategies to prolong IFNα half-life and target the tumor microenvironment have been tested, including a preclinical gene/cell therapy approach that can deliver constant amounts of IFNα into the liver to significantly curb CRC metastatic growth. The study used continuous intraperitoneal IFNα delivery in mice and found that steady and tolerable IFNα doses reduce liver CRC metastatic spreading and improve survival in several CRC mouse models. The antimetastatic effects of IFNα rely on the impairment of CRC trans-sinusoidal migration and the development of long-term anti-tumor CD8+ T cell immunity through HECs, including LSECs. Therefore, continuous IFNα therapy may represent a promising approach for preventing CRC liver metastases.
Swine influenza is a significant concern in North American breeding herds due to the continuous evolution of the influenza A virus (IAV) and its ability to transmit between vaccinated pigs. A study examined 28 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains, identifying 54 reassortant viruses. Vaccinated pigs had fewer reassortant viruses, likely due to a reduction in co-infection duration. However, direct sequencing revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. IAV vaccination is crucial for limiting virus replication in pigs and protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential. IAV infections in humans, birds, and pigs can lead to significant disease burden and economic losses. Pigs are susceptible to avian, human, and swine-origin influenza viruses, which can result in the emergence of distinct H1 and H3 IAV lineages. The distribution of IAV receptors in the swine respiratory tract facilitates IAV co-infections and reassortment, leading to new viruses. Minimizing IAV diversity should be a key strategy for One Health purposes to efficiently control IAV transmission between humans and pigs.
This study investigates the role of hippocampal place cell remapping in memory for aversive events using in vivo calcium imaging of CA1 place cells in freely behaving rats. Rats were trained to avoid a short path associated with a mild footshock, and remapping was assessed by comparing place cell population vector similarity before and after extinction of avoidance. The study found that place cells remapped significantly more following remembered than forgotten shocks and that shock-induced remapping did not cause place fields to migrate towards or away from the shocked location. Additionally, place cells remapped significantly less in response to a neutral barrier. These findings suggest that place cell remapping occurs in response to events that are remembered rather than merely perceived and forgotten, indicating that reorganization of hippocampal population codes may play a role in storing memories for aversive events. This is consistent with the view that place cells encode not only spatial maps of environmental geometry but also mnemonic information about accumulated past experiences that have occurred within an environment.
HIV-1 infection leads to the activation of the inflammasome, which may facilitate viral spread and the establishment of viral reservoirs. This study investigated the effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. The results demonstrated that targeting inflammasome activation early after infection may represent a therapeutic strategy towards an HIV cure to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion and reduce immune activation, viral load, and the HIV-1 reservoir formation. HIV-1 infection triggers immune activation/dysfunction and inflammation through several mechanisms, including direct effects of viral proteins on immune cells, persistent production of type I and II interferons driven by activation of toll-like receptors with HIV-1 RNA, fibrosis of lymphoid structure linked to CD4+ T cells depletion, and mucosal barriers damages associated with microbial translocation. Inflammation can contribute to the early control of HIV infection, but immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation can promote viral spread and the replenishment of the reservoir. Interfering with mechanisms linking inflammation and HIV-1 persistence could contribute to an HIV cure and the management of inflammation-linked comorbidities.
The death of a romantic partner is a highly traumatic experience associated with grief and mental/physiological distress, but most people adapt to the loss within six months. This adaptation likely involves the same neural systems engaged in pair bonding, and socially monogamous prairie voles provide a useful model for studying this process. Pair bonding in prairie voles leads to specific behavioral changes and neural activation patterns, and partner loss leads to behavioral and physiological distress. Previous research has shown that prairie voles can form new bonds after losing a partner, indicating their ability to adapt to loss. Here, researchers used prairie voles to study the trajectory of the pair bond transcriptional profile after partner separation. They found that pairing induced a reliable affiliative preference for a peer or a pair bonded partner, and this preference persisted even after four weeks of separation. Pair bond-associated changes in accumbal gene expression were consistent at two and six weeks post-pairing. However, once opposite-sex pairs were separated, the pair bond transcriptional signature eroded as a function of separation time. Translating ribosomal affinity purification in voles (vTRAP) identified clusters of genes associated with dopaminergic signaling, mitochondrial organization, and steroid hormone signaling whose expression patterns were sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation. Overall, the study suggests that erosion of pair bond transcriptional signatures in the NAc precedes changes in affiliative partner preference, providing insight into time-dependent neuromolecular changes that may contribute to loss adaptation.
In this study, the development of motor variability in human infants from birth to walking onset was examined through the analysis of lower-limb muscle activity during locomotor or rhythmic movements. The research followed 18 infants on 2-3 time points between birth and walking onset, recording their leg muscle activity during various movements. Unsupervised machine learning was used to show that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development. In the neonatal period, infants have a minimal number of motor primitives but generate maximal motor variability across trials due to variable activations of these primitives. A few months later, toddlers generate significantly less variability despite the existence of more primitives due to more regularity within their activation. These results suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration as soon as birth by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives that later fraction and become more consistently activated by the motor system.Variability in the motor system arises at several levels during early locomotor development. Initially, infants can perform a wide range of behaviors involving flexion and extension cycles of the lower limbs. A given behavior can be realized with numerous coordination modes, and a given coordination mode can be realized by different combinations of muscles. This multilevel variability is associated with the development of multiple components, such as the growth of musculoskeletal structures, the myelination of neural circuits, or the motivational goal to move. In adulthood, the central nervous system simplifies the coordination of numerous degrees of freedom via a small number of encoded primitives, called motor modules or muscle synergies.Modularity and variability seem antagonistic at first glance, but data from animals suggest that such variability could be generated within a modular system during development. In human infants, investigations of the motor system are more limited, but if modularity and variability coexist within the neural command, it should be possible to separate the contribution of motor primitives from the variability of EMG signals and observe their cross-evolution during development. Longitudinal following of 18 human infants and recording of EMG activity of 10 lower-limb muscles on 2-3 time points between birth and walking onset, during stepping, kicking, or walking, revealed that the human motor system could theoretically initiate its exploration by variably activating a few temporary basic structured patterns.
The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium (GTGC) was established to analyze Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data and inform public health action. In the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000), the consortium conducted a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants. The data highlights that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa, while distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR in other regions. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations is shown. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. GTGC aims to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi and inform decision-making around TCVs and other prevention and control strategies.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the flowering time is synchronized with spring through a process called vernalization, which involves cold-mediated epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). A cold-induced antisense RNA, COOLAIR, transcribed from the FLC locus, is involved in FLC silencing. The expression of COOLAIR is regulated by C-repeat (CRT)/dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) at the 3′-end of FLC and CRT/DRE-binding factors (CBFs). CBFs bind to CRT/DREs at the 3′-end of FLC, both in vitro and in vivo, and CBF levels increase gradually during vernalization. However, COOLAIR is not required for the vernalization process, as cbfs and FLCΔCOOLAIR mutants exhibit a normal vernalization response despite their inability to activate COOLAIR expression during cold. Vernalization and cold acclimation are two responses of plants to low temperatures that allow them to synchronize the timing of flowering with favorable spring conditions and tolerate thermal stress. Cold acclimation involves the activation of cold-regulated (COR) genes by low-temperature-induced CBFs, which bind to CRT/DREs in their promoters. In contrast, vernalization requires an extended cold period to silence the floral repressor gene FLC, allowing plants to synchronize the timing of flowering with favorable spring conditions. FLC encodes a MADS-box protein that represses the expression of floral activator genes, and its silencing is achieved through gradual deacetylation of FLC chromatin and concomitant removal of active histone marks, as well as the accumulation of the repressive histone mark H3 Lys27 trimethylation. Several long-term cold-induced factors have been shown to play crucial roles in the epigenetic silencing of FLC, including VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3) family genes and vernalization-induced long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, little is known about the upstream regulators of COOLAIR required for cold-induction. Recent reports have shown that an NAC domain-containing protein, NTL8, and the WRKY transcription factor, WRKY63, can bind to the promoter of COOLAIR and activate its expression, but it is not yet clear whether they are necessary for the full extent of COOLAIR induction during vernalization. A study identified CRT/DREs at the 3′-end of the FLC are required for the long-term cold response of COOLAIR and that CBFs, which accumulate during the long-term winter cold, act as upstream regulators of COOLAIR during vernalization.
The study conducted a detailed analysis of HIV-1 proviral sequences in autopsy samples from up to 18 different organ systems from three study participants who adhered to antiretroviral treatment until death. Tissue samples from the CNS and other organs were collected by rapid autopsy after death. Near full-length single-template next-generation HIV-1 proviral sequencing was performed to profile the proviral reservoir landscape at single-molecule resolution in tissue samples. A total of 1497 individual proviral sequences were amplified, of which 48 proviruses (3.21%) met the criteria for genome-intactness. Intact proviral sequences were only detected in 8 tissue sites, including basal ganglia, periventricular white matter, lymph node, spleen, colon, kidney, prostate, and the thyroid gland. The numbers of intact HIV-1 sequences in these eight tissues varied from 0.01 to 0.6 copies per million cells. Intact proviruses were detected in the basal ganglia in study participant 1 (frequency of 0.015/million cells) and in study participant 3 (0.030 intact proviruses/million cells). One intact provirus was also detected in periventricular white matter in participant 3 (0.027 intact proviruses/million cells). Defective proviral sequences were detected in all analyzed tissue samples except for the thalamus from participant 1. The ratio of intact to defective proviral species was relatively high among sequences isolated from the basal ganglia of participants 1 and 3. Clonal proviral sequences in CNS tissues were detected in all three study participants. These results demonstrate the highest frequencies of defective proviruses in lymph nodes, in the colon and in the prostate. CNS tissues contained relatively low frequencies of proviral sequences, compared to other tissue sites; however, defective proviruses were isolated in all but one of the analyzed 13 different CNS samples. The study identified near full-length proviral sequences from the central nervous system in two study participants, supporting the hypothesis that CNS cells can serve as reservoirs for long-term HIV-1 persistence despite antiretroviral therapy. Large clones of virally infected cells were broadly disseminated across multiple tissues, and involved cells from the CNS, suggesting that HIV-1 reservoir cells seeded to the brain via hematogenous spread can proliferate in the local tissue microenvironment of the central nervous system. HIV-1 can invade the CNS within days after infection, and at least three different CNS cell types seem to be susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Previous investigators identified intact proviruses in 6 out of 9 ART-treated persons, although the precise proviral DNA sequence and their possible clonality was not assessed. In this study, intact proviral sequences were detected in basal ganglia in two study participants, suggesting that HIV-1 may preferentially persist in this anatomical compartment in the CNS. An additional intact provirus was detected in periventricular white matter. In multiple instances, clones of HIV-1-infected cells were distributed across different autologous CNS tissues, suggesting local spread of virally infected cells through clonal proliferation within the immune microenvironment of the CNS.
Circadian clocks are crucial transcriptional regulators that control ~24 hour oscillations in gene expression, physiological function, and behavior, and exist in almost every tissue, with tissue-specific gene expression and function. Many diseases are associated with loss of circadian regulation, but how and when circadian clocks fail during pathogenesis is unclear due to the difficulty in monitoring tissue-specific clock function in intact organisms. A new method, Locally Activatable BioLuminescence (LABL), was developed to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live, intact Drosophila. This method revealed that specific neuronal and peripheral clocks exhibit distinct transcriptional properties and continue to oscillate even after the loss of PDF signaling, although with less stability. Distinct clocks also exhibit differences in their loss of oscillatory amplitude or their change in period depending on their anatomical location, mutation, or fly age. LABL is an effective tool for rapid, affordable, and direct real-time monitoring of individual clocks in vivo, providing a valuable tool for studying circadian rhythms and their relationship to various disease states.
Membrane trafficking pathways are crucial for establishing and maintaining the endosomal network. Retrograde protein sorting from the endosome is facilitated by conserved SNX-BAR-containing coat complexes, including retromer, which enrich cargo at tubular microdomains and generate transport carriers. In metazoans, retromer cooperates with VARP, a conserved VPS9-domain GEF, to direct an endosomal recycling pathway. The function of the yeast VARP homolog Vrl1 has been overlooked due to an inactivating mutation in commonly studied strains. Here, it is shown that Vrl1 has features of a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms an obligate complex with Vin1, the paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5, named VINE. The VINE complex occupies endosomal tubules and redistributes a conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like protein from endosomes. Membrane recruitment by Vin1 is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity, suggesting that VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome.Protein and lipid transport at the endosome requires the concerted action of peripheral cargo-sorting complexes, Rab-family GTPases, membrane tethering complexes, and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) belonging to the conserved VPS9 family are important regulators of endosomal function that activate endosomal Rab5-like GTPases. In yeast, the VPS9-domain GEFs Muk1 and Vps9 stimulate the endosomal Rabs Vps21, Ypt52, and Ypt53 to perform downstream functions, including activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to produce the anionic lipid species phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). PI3P and endosomal Rabs are important determinants of endosomal identity and are responsible for recruiting effectors, including coat proteins and vesicle tethers, to the endosomal membrane. Sorting nexins (SNXs) are a conserved family of proteins that perform direct roles in endosomal trafficking by binding to transmembrane cargo proteins and enriching them into sorting domains. SNXs localize to the endosome through conserved Phox homology (PX) domains that typically recognize PI3P. A sub-family of SNXs known as SNX-BARs additionally contains a Bin/Amphiphysin/RVS (BAR) domain that mediates dimerization with other BAR domain-containing proteins and imparts membrane binding/deforming properties. These SNX-BAR dimers are emerging as important regulators of protein transport.The seven SNX-BAR proteins present in yeast include the conserved retromer subunits Vps5 and Vps17, the SNX8 homolog Mvp1, the SNX4 homolog Snx4 and its partners Snx41 and Atg20, and the Vps5 paralog Ykr078w. Retromer and Snx4 complexes promote cargo sorting from the endosome and vacuole, while Mvp1 appears to function only at the endosome. The best characterized of these SNX-BAR-containing complexes is the heteropentameric retromer complex, which is composed of the Vps26-Vps35-Vps29 trimer and the Vps5-Vps17 SNX-BAR dimer. Retromer localizes to PI3P-rich membranes where it promotes the retrograde sorting of cargo including the well-characterized carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) receptor Vps10. In metazoans, the term retromer refers specifically to the VPS26-VPS35-VPS29 trimer, which associates with a variety of adaptor proteins including SNXs to promote cargo sorting. Mutations in VPS35 have been linked to neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, establishing a connection between endosomal transport machinery and human neurological health. A physical association between yeast retromer and the VPS9-domain GEFs Vps9 and Muk1, whose activity is required to maintain endosomal pools of PI3P for retromer recruitment, has been identified. A novel VPS9-domain protein, Vrl1, physically associates with retromer to drive an endosome-to-plasma membrane sorting pathway. Vrl1 is a member of the SNX-BAR protein family and specifically binds the Vps5 paralog Ykr078w/Vin1 to form the VINE complex, which may operate alongside the retromer, Mvp1, and Snx4 pathways.
A study on the effects of temperature on interaction strengths of marine fish species in the Boso Peninsula, Japan was conducted using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding on 550 seawater samples collected over two years. The study aimed to detect and quantify fish-fish interactions and their fluctuating interaction strengths under field conditions, and to analyze the impact of water temperature on interspecific interaction strengths. The study found that water temperature influenced fish-fish interaction strengths, and the impact varied among fish species, indicating that fish species identity influences the temperature effects on interactions. The results suggest that an increase in water temperature due to global climate change may change fish interactions in a complex way, consequently influencing marine community dynamics and stability. The study provides a practical research framework to study the effects of environmental variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature, contributing to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.
The avian palaeognath phylogeny has undergone significant revisions due to advancements in genome-wide comparative analyses, providing insights into the evolution of modern dinosaur eggshells' microstructure and crystallography. This study analyzed eggshells of major palaeognath clades, including extinct taxa, and selected eggshells of neognathae and non-avian dinosaurs using electron backscatter diffraction. The results show detailed microstructures and crystallographies of previously loosely categorized ostrich-, rhea-, and tinamou-style morphotypes of palaeognath eggshells. All rhea-style eggshell appears homologous, while ostrich-style and tinamou-style morphotypes are best interpreted as homoplastic morphologies. Ancestral state reconstruction and parsimony analysis indicate that rhea-style eggshell represents the ancestral state of palaeognath eggshells in both microstructure and crystallography. These findings have ornithological and palaeontological implications, aiding other disciplines where palaeognath eggshells provide useful archives for comparative contrasts. Non-avian dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Mesozoic, but avian dinosaurs are still extant and flourishing. Dinosaur eggs, primarily biominerals, can be well-preserved in the fossil record and are valuable for evolutionary biology, tracking phenotypic changes over geological timescales. However, homoplastic similarities can obscure understanding of egg evolution within a single dinosaur clade. Documenting the evolution of eggs among modern avian dinosaurs provides helpful insights into the evolution among extinct taxa. Palaeognathae, one of two major clades of modern birds, has distinctive microstructures compared to those of neognathae. Eggshells of Palaeognathae show diverse microstructures, making them more appropriate modern analogues for those of flightless non-avian dinosaurs than those of volant neognathae. Previous studies of palaeognath eggs and eggshells interpreted features based on morphology-based phylogenies, which have changed due to molecular approaches. Revisiting eggs and eggshells of Palaeognathae with a revised phylogeny is a timely issue for a comprehensive and updated understanding of avian egg evolution.
USVs, or ultrasonic vocalizations, are crucial for communication and navigation in many species, including rodents, bats, cetaceans, and some primates. They have various functions such as distress calls, courtship signals, territorial defense signals, private communication, and echolocation. USVs have been extensively studied in mice, where they have been shown to influence conspecific behavior and convey affective and social information in different behavioral contexts. Their neuronal circuitry has been identified and is being studied extensively, making mouse USVs increasingly useful as a behavioral measure in neurodevelopmental and neurolinguistic translational research. Their manipulation and precise measurement can help tackle fundamental questions and pave the way for the discovery of essential, novel drug targets for many debilitating conditions. However, attributing USVs to their emitter during close interactions has emerged as a key challenge. To address this, the Hybrid Vocalization Localizer (HyVL) has been developed, a hybrid ultrasonic tracking system that integrates a high-resolution acoustic camera with high-quality ultrasonic microphones, achieving millimeter precision in localizing USVs and improving the precision with which social communication between rodents can be studied. HyVL has been used to analyze mouse courtship interactions and has found that males and females vocalize in starkly different relative spatial positions and that the fraction of female vocalizations has likely been overestimated previously due to imprecise localization. Additionally, when two male mice interact with one female, one of the males takes a dominant role in the interaction both in terms of the vocalization rate and the location relative to the female. HyVL is affordable, open-source, easy to set up, and can be integrated with existing setups, making it a valuable tool for studying USVs.
Sarcomeres, the force-producing units of striated muscles, are critically dependent on the large titin protein for their nanostructure. In vertebrates, titin spans from the Z-disc to the M-band, linking actin and myosin filaments and determining sarcomere length. However, the role of titin in sarcomere architecture outside of vertebrates is not well understood. In Drosophila, there are two titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, located in the I-band and A-band of flight muscles, respectively, with their ends overlapping at the I-band/A-band border. This staggered organization may help to stably anchor Sallimus at the myosin filament and ensure efficient force transduction during flight. Sallimus is responsible for the high stiffness of flight muscles, and its isoform Kettin uses an alternative poly-A site that terminates the protein after Sls-Ig domain 35. However, recent studies have shown that the most prominent Sls flight muscle isoform uses a different poly-A site and is longer than previously thought. Projectin is present in an extended conformation, with a large part located along the myosin filament. To determine the precise architecture of Sls and Projectin within the flight muscle sarcomere, DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy was used, revealing that both N-terminal anti-Sls nanobodies result in single bands at the Z-discs, while C-terminal anti-Sls nanobodies and C-terminally located Projectin domains result in two bands at large distances from the Z-disc. This suggests that a large part of Projectin is present along the myosin filament. However, higher spatial resolution is necessary to precisely localize Sls and Projectin domains close to the Z-disc. Super-resolution imaging with DNA-PAINT was used to resolve the relative localization of Sls and Projectin, revealing that the two bands flanking a Z-disc can be resolved, which cannot be done with diffraction-limited imaging. This enabled accurate location of the measured bands for each of the epitopes in every analysed sarcomere, allowing for the detection of individual differences in sarcomeric band positions in each sarcomere investigated down to the nanometre-scale. Co-staining with two nanobodies that are spaced sufficiently apart allowed for the resolution of the positions of Sls-Nano2 and Sls-Nano39, as well as Proj-Nano29 and Proj-Nano30, enabling the location of the exact position of the different Projectin domains in sarcomeres. All the analysed epitopes localise in similarly sharp bands in each of the sarcomeres, suggesting a very precisely aligned architecture of Sls and Projectin. The distance measurements between the N-terminus of Sls and the centre of the Z-disc are compatible with the very N-terminus of Sls being located at the centre of the Z-disc. However, the N-terminus of Projectin is located around 100 nm away from the Z-disc and hence cannot be anchored directly at the Z-disc.
The article presents a new method for measuring the viscoelastic properties of individual cells using a high-throughput, simple, and low-cost microfluidic approach. The cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and pumped through a microfluidic channel, where the fluid shear stress induces large, elliptical cell deformations and causes the cells to rotate in a tank-treading manner. The frequency-dependent viscoelastic cell properties are then extracted from the cell deformation and tank-treading frequency using a theoretical framework developed by Roscoe. The accuracy of the method is confirmed using atomic force microscopy-calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells. The measurements demonstrate that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell-cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks. This method can be used to measure the viscoelastic properties of cells, which can help elucidate higher order cell functions in health and disease. For example, the activation of neutrophils is typically accompanied by a marked increase in cell stiffness, which can lead to a sequestration of the stiffened cells in small capillaries, potentially relevant for the progression and exacerbation of inflammatory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019. The method described in the article provides a quantitative, low-cost, high-throughput, and simple way to measure the viscoelastic properties of cells, specifically the storage modulus G' and the loss modulus G''. The cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and pumped at pressures through a microfluidic channel, where the fluid shear stress induces large cell deformations that are imaged using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera. The method takes advantage of the shear stress profile inside a long microfluidic channel and the tank-treading motion of the cells to estimate the storage modulus and loss modulus of the cell. The Roscoe model is used to compute the stiffness (shear modulus) and viscosity of a cell from 5 measurable parameters. The method is verified using cell lines and calibrated polyacrylamide beads and is shown to provide accurate quantitative measurements of viscoelastic properties that conform to soft glassy power-law rheology that has been reported for a wide range of cells measured with different methods. The method can also be used for dose-response measurements of drugs that induce actin cytoskeleton disassembly, and these responses are modulated by the cell cycle and the intermediate filament network of the cells.
The cardiac muscle has the highest mitochondrial density of any human tissue, but mitochondrial dysfunction is not a recognized cause of isolated cardiomyopathy. However, a rare mitofusin 2 (MFN2) R400Q mutation is over-represented in clinical cardiomyopathy. This specific mutation is not reported as a cause of MFN2 mutant-induced peripheral neuropathy, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). MFN2 Q400 mutants have impaired mitochondrial fusion and are defective in recruiting Parkin to mitochondria, leading to mitophagy defects and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. CRISPR editing of the R400Q mutation into the mouse Mfn2 gene induces perinatal cardiomyopathy with no other organ involvement. Overall, MFN2 R400Q is the first known natural mitophagy-defective MFN2 mutant, suggesting a mechanism for enrichment in clinical cardiomyopathy. Hearts rely on mitochondria-derived ATP for development, excitation–contraction–coupling, and myocardial repair after damage or senescence. MFN2 and MFN1 are critical mediators of reparative mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial culling for quality control, and mitochondrial replacement for metabolic plasticity in the heart. Clinical and experimental data relating MFN functioning to cardiac health appear discordant, with mitochondrial motility defects and impaired mitophagy seemingly underlying cardiomyopathies provoked by Mfn gene ablation or engineered MFN2 mutant expression. MFN2 multifunctionality reflects its ability to bind different protein partners as determined by specific phosphorylation events. Thus, different patterns of mitofusin dysfunction underlie organ-specific manifestations of clinical diseases caused by MFN2 mutations. Rare mutations can be overlooked in standard genotype–phenotype association studies, requiring targeted analyses of exome/whole-genome sequence data. A largely overlooked, very rare MFN2 mutation, MFN2 R400Q, was over-represented in cardiomyopathy among individuals of African descent.
Research suggests that mouse lifespan can be significantly influenced by endocrine or nutritional signals in the first few weeks of life, with early-life development being particularly susceptible to such signals. This susceptibility can be influenced by factors such as litter size, growth hormone levels, and mutations affecting early-life growth rate. Additionally, the pace of early development in mice can be affected by exposure to olfactory cues, including odors of same-sex adult mice, which can delay maturation.A study found that the lifespan of female mice can be increased significantly by transient exposure to odors from adult females from 3 days until 60 days of age. However, male lifespan was not affected by exposure to odors from adults of either sex. This effect on female lifespan was not modified by conditional deletion of the G protein Gαo in the olfactory system, which leads to impaired accessory olfactory system function and blunted reproductive priming responses to male odors in females.Early-life interventions have been shown to have the power to produce long-lasting effects on mouse physiology, with effects on late-life illnesses and survival. For example, the exceptionally long lifespan of Ames dwarf mice, which is due to lower levels of growth hormone (GH) produced by the anterior pituitary, can be reduced back to that of non-mutant controls by transient exposure to daily GH injections started at 2 weeks of age and discontinued 6 weeks later.Manipulation of conspecific social odors has been shown to be another vector for early-life modulation of late-life fitness and mortality risks. A study found that exposure to same-sex odor, which delays development in some circumstances, might also delay the rate of age-related decline. Female mice exposed early to odors from adult females had longer lifespan than females exposed to water. However, the mechanism for this lifespan effect in female mice is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to explore this question.
The study found that both CNO and C21, chemogenetic actuators used to activate designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), can modulate sleep in wild-type laboratory mice that do not express DREADD receptors. This implies that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying the side effects of chemogenetic actuators. The researchers suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators. The study found a dose-dependent suppression of REM sleep, changes in EEG spectral power during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and altered sleep architecture after intraperitoneal injections of CNO in wild-type male laboratory mice. Similar effects were observed with the novel DREADD actuator, C21, which does not convert to clozapine. These results demonstrate that both CNO and C21 can modulate sleep of mice not expressing DREADD receptors, implying that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying side effects of chemogenetic actuators. Therefore, any chemogenetic experiment should include a DREADD-free control group injected with the same CNO, C21, or newly developed actuator. The study suggests that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators.
The study of microbial chemotaxis is crucial due to its role in various biological processes, such as microbial foraging and reproduction. Microfluidic devices have become essential for this research due to their precise control over the chemical environment. However, the vast landscape of potential chemical compounds, combinations, and concentration gradient conditions necessitates the development of new high-throughput devices. The Microfluidic Multiplexed Chemotaxis Device (MCD) is a novel microfluidic tool that enables high-throughput chemotaxis screening of swimming microorganisms to chemical stimuli across concentration gradient conditions. The MCD is a two-layer device that performs six stop-flow diffusion chemotaxis assays simultaneously, spanning five orders of magnitude in chemostimulant concentration. The MCD has been fully characterized and validated against a conventional chemotaxis device for a known marine bacterial chemotaxis system (Vibrio alginolyticus). The MCD significantly accelerates the chemotactic screening process, enabling rapid chemotaxis phenotyping and facilitating comparative studies across different swimming microorganisms, chemostimulants, and concentration gradient conditions. The MCD's high-throughput capabilities and efficient design make it an invaluable tool for probing the wide scope and scale of chemotactic behaviors across various complex systems.
Neural crest development is transcriptionally controlled through sequential activation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), but recent evidence suggests a role for post-transcriptional regulation in modulating GRN outputs. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from avian embryos, Elavl1, an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes transcripts, was identified as enriched in premigratory cranial neural crest. Perturbation of Elavl1 results in premature neural crest delamination and reduction in transcripts associated with the neural crest specification GRN, similar to downregulation of the Wnt inhibitor Draxin. Elavl1 stabilizes Draxin mRNA during cranial neural crest specification, and exogenous Draxin rescues cranial neural crest specification defects upon Elavl1 knockdown. Therefore, Elavl1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of cranial neural crest specification via Draxin mRNA stabilization, highlighting the intersection of post-transcriptional regulation with neural crest GRN modulation. RNA-binding proteins, such as Elavl1, are essential for neural crest development, and post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in neural crest formation, maintenance, and regulation. Cranial neural crest cells are essential for craniofacial development, and post-transcriptional regulation is increasingly recognized as an essential component in these processes. Elavl1 is a potential regulator of cranial neural crest specification, and its knockout in mice often displays defects in craniofacial structures. Elavl1 is expressed in specified, premigratory cranial neural crest cells following establishment of the neural plate border and is retained during the onset of EMT and in early migrating cranial neural crest cells. Elavl1 is required during early cranial neural crest development to regulate specification and prevent premature delamination. Elavl1 directly interacts with and stabilizes Draxin mRNA during cranial neural crest specification, and Draxin is the primary target bound and stabilized by Elavl1. Elavl1 does not broadly bind and stabilize the transcripts of neural crest genes, but rather targets specific RNAs to drive cranial neural crest specification.
The ability to breathe is crucial for life, and it is facilitated by complex neural networks and cellular mechanisms in the brainstem and spinal cord that control muscle contractions for respiratory-related movements. The preBötzinger (preBötC) complex generates the respiratory rhythm, which is then relayed through the rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG) to Phrenic Motor Column (PMC) neurons in the spinal cord. These neurons provide the sole innervation to the diaphragm, a muscle essential for inspiration. Although the ability of phrenic motor neurons (MNs) to receive and integrate descending inputs from the rVRG is vital for breathing, the molecular mechanisms underlying rVRG-PMC connectivity are unclear. Phrenic MNs are a specialized subset of MNs that express a unique combination of cell surface adhesion molecules that could potentially serve as molecular recognition tags for descending brainstem axons. A distinct combinatorial cadherin code, including both the broadly expressed type I N-cadherin and a subset of specific type II cadherins, defines phrenic MNs. Cadherins establish the segregation and settling position of MN cell bodies in the spinal cord and contribute to the wiring of motor circuits. However, their function in the development, connectivity, and function of phrenic MNs has not been established.Recent studies have shown that coordinated type I and II cadherin signaling is necessary for robust respiratory output. MN-specific deletion of cadherins N, 6, 9, and 10 leads to severe respiratory insufficiency, gasping for breath, and death within hours of birth. Cadherins are crucial for respiratory motor output, as MN-specific cadherin inactivation leads to a striking decrease in phrenic MN activity. They establish phrenic MN cell body positioning and dendritic orientation, but cell body positioning is likely dispensable for proper phrenic MN firing. Cadherin signaling is also required in Dbx1-derived interneurons, which give rise to the premotor rVRG, for phrenic MN bursting activity.In summary, cadherins are vital to respiratory circuit assembly and function. They dictate wiring specificity through multifaceted functions in dendritic organization and molecular recognition. The combinatorial activity of N-cadherin, Cdh6, 9, and 10 is required for proper respiratory behavior. Diaphragm innervation defects and phrenic MN migration, survival, and positioning may contribute to respiratory insufficiency upon cadherin inactivation. However, the perinatal lethality in NMNΔ6910KO mice is unlikely due solely to a ~30% reduction in diaphragm innervation. Instead, it may result from altered cell body and dendritic topography in NMNΔ and NMNΔ6910KO mice, leading to changes in phrenic MN activity and integration into respiratory circuits.
The widespread issue of misinformation on social media platforms has led to increased polarization, racism, and resistance to climate action and vaccines. Current measures to halt the spread of misinformation have had limited impact. A study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the spread of misinformation on social media platforms is facilitated by the existing incentive structure of those platforms, where social rewards like 'likes' and 'shares' are dissociated from the veracity of the information. The study aimed to test the efficacy of an incentive structure where 'carrots' and 'sticks' are directly associated with accuracy. The study tested the efficacy of such a structure by slightly altering the engagement options offered to users, adding an option to react to posts using 'trust' and 'distrust' buttons. The results showed that participants used the 'trust' and 'distrust' buttons to discern true from misinformation more so than the commonly existing engagement options. Participants shared more true information and less false information in order to obtain more 'trust' carrots and fewer 'distrust' sticks. The new feedback options could both reinforce user behavior that generates trustworthy material and signal to others that the post is dependable. This study offers evidence for an intervention that could be adopted to reduce misinformation spread without reducing engagement.
Microtubules, crucial for intracellular motility, can generate force during mitosis by disassembling and curling protofilaments exerting pulling force on kinetochores. The curvature of these protofilaments is key to generating force, but methods for modifying their mechanical and energetic properties have not been described. However, a study has shown that adding magnesium increases the mechanical energy output of curling protofilaments and that yeast microtubules generate larger and more energetic working strokes than bovine microtubules. These increases can be explained by lengthening the protofilament curls without changing their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. This demonstrates how work output from curling protofilaments can be tuned and suggests evolutionary conservation of the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubule lattice.
Hagfishes, a group of jawless vertebrates, possess unique slime glands that produce a defensive slime made up of mucus and threads, which expands rapidly upon contact with seawater and clogs the mouth and gills of predators. The origin of these thread- and mucus-producing cells in the slime glands is unclear, but evidence suggests they may have originated from the epidermis. A study of hagfish epidermis revealed the presence of large intracellular threads within a putatively homologous cell type to the slime gland cells. These epidermal threads are densely packed and cover the entire body of the hagfish, with each square millimeter of skin storing a total of ~96 cm of threads. Experimentally induced damage to the skin releases these threads, forming an adhesive epidermal slime that is more fibrous and less dilute than the defensive slime. Transcriptome analysis supports the epidermal origin of hagfish slime, with duplication and diversification of thread genes occurring in parallel with the evolution of slime glands. The evolution of hagfish slime likely occurred through the selection for stronger and more voluminous slime.
The study investigates the potential disease-modifying effects of sodium selenate treatment in chronic drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using a rat model. TLE is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, and current treatments are ineffective in more than 30% of cases and can cause significant side effects. The study used Wistar rats that underwent kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (SE) or sham and received sodium selenate, levetiracetam, or vehicle subcutaneous infusion continuously for four weeks. The results showed that sodium selenate treatment was associated with a reduction in spontaneous seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and sensorimotor deficits at eight weeks post-treatment cessation. Additionally, selenate treatment was associated with increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau, and reversed telomere length shortening.The study also identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with TLE using network medicine integration of multi-omics/pre-clinical outcomes. The results suggest that sodium selenate treatment results in a sustained disease-modifying effect in chronically epileptic rats in the post-KA SE model of TLE, including improved comorbid learning and memory deficits.TLE is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and there is a compelling need to identify pharmacological disease-modifying treatments that are effective in patients with chronic TLE. The study provides evidence that sodium selenate has disease-modifying effects in an animal model of chronic drug-resistant TLE, and further research is needed to determine its potential clinical utility.In summary, the study found that sodium selenate treatment in chronically epileptic rats with TLE was associated with a reduction in spontaneous seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and sensorimotor deficits. Additionally, selenate treatment was associated with increased PP2A expression, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau, and reversed telomere length shortening. The study's findings suggest that sodium selenate has disease-modifying effects in an animal model of chronic drug-resistant TLE and provides a potential therapeutic approach for this debilitating condition.
The study introduces a new concept called 'Skeletal Age' to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual. Skeletal Age is defined as the sum of chronological age and the number of years of life lost (YLL) associated with a fracture. The study used data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register, which includes the whole-country data of 1,667,339 adults in Denmark born on or before January 1, 1950, who were followed up to December 31, 2016 for incident low-trauma fracture and mortality. The study found that a fracture was associated with between 1 and 7 years of life lost, with the loss being greater in men than women. Hip fractures incurred the greatest loss of life years. The study estimates that for a 60-year-old individual with a hip fracture, the Skeletal Age is 66 for men and 65 for women. The study proposes Skeletal Age as a new metric to assess the impact of a fragility fracture on an individual's life expectancy, which will enhance doctor-patient risk communication about the risks associated with osteoporosis. The study also highlights the undertreatment of osteoporosis and the crisis in its management, and the urgency for a more informative metric to internalize the combined risks of fracture and mortality in a way that patients and doctors can comprehend easily. The study concludes that the concept of ‘Effective Age’ is useful in conveying the risk of post-fracture mortality and can improve the management of osteoporosis.
A deep learning method called Brain Extraction Net (BEN) has been proposed to accurately extract brain tissue from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. BEN is a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network that has been evaluated on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans. BEN has shown superiority in robustness, accuracy, and generalizability compared to conventional toolboxes. It not only provides a generalized solution for extracting brain tissue across species but also improves the accuracy of atlas registration, thereby benefiting downstream processing tasks. BEN is designed as an open-source software to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications. The development of BEN addresses the need for accurate brain tissue extraction in cross-species studies, which are important for studying evolution, development, and the treatment of neurological disorders.
Candida albicans, a commensal microorganism in humans, can cause a range of infections, from superficial to life-threatening, and is responsible for an estimated 750,000 cases of systemic candidiasis annually, with a mortality rate of around 40%. Like most organisms, C. albicans requires iron for its survival, and it can acquire iron through various mechanisms, such as expressing ferric reductases (FREs) on its surface to reduce ferric iron to its more soluble ferrous ion and/or extract it from iron chelates. The C. albicans genome contains at least 15 genes encoding FRE-like proteins. Heme, or Fe-protoporphyrin IX, is a molecule that serves as a cellular cofactor and is present in many natural environments, and thus, environmental heme can be utilized as an alternative iron source by many organisms via a large repertoire of heme acquisition systems. In animals, HRG-1-like heme transporters can mediate extracellular heme import or intracellular heme transport, and the human membrane protein FLVCR2 functions as a heme importer. In the case of C. albicans, it expresses a distinct family of GPI-anchored and soluble extracellular hemophores containing a heme-binding CFEM domain, which can extract heme from hemoglobin and transfer it across the cell wall to the plasma membrane. Heme utilization in C. albicans requires, in addition to the CFEM hemophores, components of the endocytic pathway, the ESCRT system, and vacuolar function, suggesting that it involves endocytosis of the heme to the vacuole. In this study, the researchers identified Frp1 and Frp2, two ferric reductase (FRE)-related proteins that lack an extracellular N-terminal substrate-binding domain, as being required for hemoglobin heme utilization and for sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. Frp1 and Frp2 redistribute to the plasma membrane in the presence of hemin, consistent with a direct role in heme trafficking. Expression of Frp1 with the CFEM heme heme uptake system can promote heme utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, confirming the functional interaction between these proteins. The researchers conclude that Frp1/2 and the CFEM hemophores form a functional complex that evolved from FREs to enable extracellular heme uptake. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms of heme uptake and utilization in C. albicans and highlights the importance of these processes in the pathogenesis of C. albicans infections.
The seventh pandemic of cholera, a diarrheal disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae, has been ongoing since 1960 and results in 21,000-143,000,000 deaths annually. The bacterium's ability to persist in the environment and cause sudden outbreaks is due to its rapid adaptation to changing environments, facilitated by sensory proteins like ToxR and ToxS. These proteins, located at the inner membrane, react to environmental stimuli such as bile acid and induce survival strategies such as bile resistance and virulence regulation. A recent study used crystallography and interaction studies to determine the structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS and their interaction with bile acid. The results suggest an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function, with a bile binding pocket in ToxS only properly folded upon binding to ToxR. This finding supports the link between ToxRS and VtrAC-like co-component systems and highlights the significance of ToxRS as the only experimentally determined structure within this superfamily. The conservation of the ToxRS complex across various Vibrio species and the potential of disrupting this vital interaction for inhibiting Vibrio survival and virulence make this a promising area of research for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system.
The hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory and spatial navigation, and recent work suggests it has additional roles in imagination, visual perception, and decision-making. It is a complex structure with multiple subfields and functional differences along its anterior-posterior axis. While the functional differentiation within the hippocampus is becoming clearer, less is known about the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these functional differences in the human brain. A detailed understanding of anatomical connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus is needed to better understand and interpret these functional differences. This study aimed to systematically examine the patterns of structural connectivity between cortical brain areas and the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus. The researchers used diffusion MRI data from the Human Connectome Project, quantitative fibre-tracking methods, and a processing pipeline specifically tailored to study hippocampal connectivity with three primary aims: (i) to quantitatively characterise structural connectivity between the cortical mantle (focused on non-MTL areas) and the whole hippocampus; (ii) to quantitatively characterise how structural connectivity varies between cortical areas and the head, body, and tail of the hippocampus; and (iii) to use TDI combined with ‘endpoint density mapping’ to quantitatively assess, visualise, and map the spatial distribution of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus associated with each cortical area. The results represent a major advance in the ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in vivo and the understanding of the neural architecture that underpins hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain. The study provides fundamental insights into how specific cortical areas preferentially connect along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus and identifies where streamlines associated with a given cortical area preferentially connect within the hippocampus. These detailed anatomical insights will help fine-tune network connectivity models and will have an impact on current theoretical models of human hippocampal memory function.
The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, responding to cytoplasmic dsDNA and activating the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-κB), leading to increased production of type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. STING has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a study using a mouse model with a constitutively active STING variant (N153S), it was demonstrated that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, a key feature of PD. This neurodegeneration was preceded by neuroinflammation, as indicated by elevated neuroinflammatory markers in juvenile mice. Depleting or blocking STING has been shown to alleviate neurodegeneration in models of PD and ALS, suggesting that targeting the STING pathway could be beneficial in these diseases. Further research is needed to determine the specific effects of individual components of this signalling network and to design effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
The majority of cancer patients treated with immunotherapies, such as checkpoint blockade therapy, experience only partial response followed by relapse of resistant tumors. While treatment resistance has been attributed to clonal selection and immunoediting, comparisons of paired primary and relapsed tumors in melanoma and breast cancers indicate that they share the majority of clones. A study in both mouse models and clinical human samples found that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique transient cell-in-cell structures, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. These formations are mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells, which induce phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT3 and EGR-1 in tumor cells. Inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. This work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism which enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity. Most therapeutic strategies are aimed at harnessing T-cell immunity to fight cancer, including de novo expansion of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells, engineered T cells, or blocking antibodies directed against suppressive receptors. However, long-term follow-up indicates that while patients will experience tumor regression, it is frequently followed by recurrence of tumors that are largely resistant to subsequent treatments. Whole exome and genome sequencing comparisons of paired primary and relapsed tumors indicate that most clones in relapsed tumors are shared with the primary tumors, suggesting relatively low rates of clonal deletion. To study this process in melanoma and breast cancer, several mouse models were developed in which resistant tumors relapse following immunotherapies. In both mice and humans, tumor cells remaining after immunotherapy form unique cell-in-cell structures and generate membrane architecture that is impenetrable by immune-derived lytic granules, cytotoxic compounds, and chemotherapies. These findings suggest that this biological process is a central mechanism through which tumor cells escape T-cell immunity and give rise to relapsed tumors.
This study explores the capacity of marmosets, a social primate species, to process Theory of Mind (ToM) by examining their gaze patterns and brain activations while observing Frith-Happé animations. These animations depict triangles moving randomly, goal-directedly, or in response to each other's mental states. Previous research has established that humans exhibit longer fixations on the triangles in ToM animations and activate specific brain regions when differentiating between ToM and random scenarios. However, findings on nonhuman primates have been inconsistent. This study found that both marmosets and humans exhibited longer fixations on one triangle in ToM animations, but marmosets did not show the same pattern of longer overall fixation duration on ToM animations as humans. Both species activated extensive and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM versus Random animations, indicating a similar differentiation between these scenarios. While marmosets did not mimic human overall fixation patterns, their gaze behavior and neural activations suggest a distinction between ToM and non-ToM scenarios, expanding our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities.
In the regulation of stem cell differentiation, the coordinated control of gene activity by transcriptional and translational mechanisms is crucial for timely cell-state transitions. However, the precise mechanistic understanding of gene transcription fine-tuning is lacking due to the compensatory effect of translational control. This study focuses on intermediate neural progenitor (INP) identity commitment to define the mechanisms that fine-tune stemness gene transcription in fly neural stem cells, or neuroblasts. The research demonstrates that the transcription factor FruitlessC (FruC) binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in neuroblasts. The loss of fruC function alone has no effect on INP commitment but drives INP dedifferentiation when translational control is reduced. FruC negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. The reduction of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 activity increases stemness gene activity, similar to fruC loss-of-function. The study suggests that low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the fine-tuning of gene transcription in stem cells and the potential implications for development and disease.
In a human adult, billions of apoptotic cells are removed daily by professional and nonprofessional phagocytes. While it is believed that apoptotic bodies are cleared by professional phagocytes such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells, a study has found that neutrophils, a type of short-living phagocytic cell, are the predominant phagocytes responsible for the clearance of apoptotic hepatic cells in the steady state. Neutrophils burrow directly into apoptotic hepatocytes and ingest them from the inside, a process called perforocytosis. Defects in this key housekeeping function of neutrophils contribute to the genesis of autoimmune liver disease. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that maintains internal tissue homeostasis. An estimated hundred billion cells undergo apoptosis daily in a human adult. These apoptotic cells must be disposed of promptly and efficiently without causing inflammation. Defects in the clearance of apoptotic bodies are often linked to various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It is widely believed that apoptotic bodies are cleared by professional phagocytes, such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells, or by local nonprofessional phagocytes, such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. However, the phagocytes responsible for the removal of apoptotic cells in the homeostatic state remain uncertain and it is unknown whether they are tissue specific. Neutrophils, a type of terminally differentiated and short-living phagocytic cell, represent 50–70% of the total white blood cell population in humans. However, neutrophils are not considered key players in apoptotic cell clearance. They instead function as inflammatory cells responsible for killing bacteria and fighting infection. Blood neutrophils often swarm to the site of infection, where they release toxic mediators that not only kill microorganisms but also can damage tissues. To prevent inflammation, apoptotic cells have been shown to release ‘keep-out’ signals, such as lactoferrin, that prevent the recruitment of neutrophils to the apoptotic site. Nevertheless, neutrophils are related to multiple autoimmune diseases. For example, mild neutropenia was observed to precede and accompany the onset of type 1 diabetes, a typical autoimmune disease. The role of neutrophils in the clearance of apoptotic bodies and contribute to autoimmunity remain to be solved.
The control of movement is facilitated by the flexor-extensor motor neuron activation patterns, which are regulated by a network of interneurons in the spinal cord. The neuroanatomical arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns is thought to aid in processing information by spinal circuits. Rabies retrograde monosynaptic tracing has been used to label premotor interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools, and previous studies have reported topographic mediolateral positional biases in flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. However, a more recent study using multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons. This suggests that premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components.The precise regulation of the timing and pattern of activation of muscle groups across a joint is crucial for motor control. In limbed vertebrates, the activity of flexor and extensor muscles is directed by dedicated pools of motor neurons that receive inputs from different subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. The incomplete knowledge of the composition of spinal circuitry that controls the activity of flexor and extensor motor neurons limits progress toward a full understanding of motor circuits. Viral trans-synaptic tracing techniques have been used to map motor circuits, but the identification of monosynaptic connectivity relied on the timing of transsynaptic jumps, leading to uncertainty about the number of synapses between a labeled neuron and the motor neurons innervating the injected muscle. The introduction of RabV monosynaptic tracing provided a high-throughput method for mapping presynaptic connectivity of selected neuronal populations.Monosynaptic restriction is achieved by using a mutant virus lacking the gene encoding the rabies glycoprotein (G; ΔG-RabV), which is necessary for transsynaptic transfer, combined with selective complementation of G expression in neurons of choice. Various methodologies have been used to restrict G expression to the target neuronal population, with these G-expressing neurons becoming ‘starter cells’ from which infecting ΔG-RabV can jump only one synapse and selectively label presynaptic neurons.Shortly after its introduction, monosynaptic rabies tracing was applied to the study of premotor interneurons in the spinal cord. To obtain selective complementation of G and subsequent rabies monosynaptic transfer from a single motor neuron pool, an elegant approach based on intramuscular co-injection of an AAV expressing G (AAV-G) and ΔG-RabV, both of which can infect motor neurons retrogradely, was described. This method has been used to study the distribution of premotor interneurons controlling the activity of extensor and flexor muscles in the hindlimb and showed a prominent spatial segregation along the medio-lateral axis of the dorsal ipsilateral spinal cord, with extensor premotor interneurons found in more medial positions than flexors. However, subsequent studies using different methods have not shown segregation of flexor and extensor premotor interneurons.In order to determine the spatial distribution of premotor interneurons controlling flexion and extension of the ankle, ΔG-RabV/mCherry and ΔG-RabV/eGFP were injected in the TA (tibialis anterior; ankle flexor) and LG (lateral gastrocnemius; ankle extensor) muscles of postnatal day (P) 1–2 ChatCre/+; Rosa26RΦGT mice. Analysis of lumbar level (L) 2 and L5 sections 8-9 days after injection revealed two main clusters of premotor interneurons located in the dorsal ipsilateral and ventral contralateral spinal cord. However, projection of x-y coordinates along the rostro-caudal axis of the spinal cord showed no difference in medio-lateral and dorso-ventral positions of flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. Similarly, projection along the horizontal plane or sagittal plane revealed no obvious differences in the rostro-caudal, dorso-ventral, and medio-lateral distribution of flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. These results suggest that there is no spatial segregation of flexor and extensor premotor interneurons.
Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is a powerful tool for investigating brain-wide functional connectivity, but it is susceptible to systemic physiological changes such as respiration and cardiac pulsations, usually treated as non-neuronal artifacts. However, respiration can also drive neural activity changes and directly modulate the rsfMRI signal. A study in rats found a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and gamma-band power of the electrophysiological signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Slow respiration variations were also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network, mediated by gamma-band neural activity. This respiration-related brain network disappeared when brain-wide neural activity was silenced, confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network. These findings identify a respiration-related brain network underpinned by neural activity, distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts, and open a new avenue for investigating the interactions between respiration, neural activity, and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions.
Greater mouse-eared bats use two foraging strategies, gleaning ground-dwelling arthropods and hawking aerial prey, with different success rates. Despite a higher success rate in hawking (76% vs 30%), bats catch more prey overall through gleaning (29 vs 25 prey/bat/night) due to the larger size of ground prey. Prey switching based on environmental conditions plays a key role in meeting energy intake requirements. Bats primarily use the same foraging strategy each night, adapting their hunting behavior to weather and ground conditions. Prey profitability influences foraging strategies, with gleaning providing 2.3-14 times higher profitability than hawking. This study demonstrates the importance of prey profitability and environmental dynamics in shaping the foraging strategies of specialized predators.
The evolution of human right-handedness has been a topic of intense debate, with researchers seeking to understand the factors that have influenced hand preference in humans and other primates. A study combining original data with published literature reports analyzed hand preferences in 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates. The study found that human right-handedness is an extreme among anthropoids and that species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates, but did not strongly correlate with any selected biological predictors. However, patterns of hand preference strength were variable and showed signatures of both ecology and phylogeny. The study challenges popular ideas on primate handedness evolution and suggests that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of humans. Human lateralization patterns do not align with trends found among other anthropoids, and the universal proportion of approximately 85-95% right-handers in humans appears to be an unmatched extreme among primates. Both strength and direction of population-level manual lateralization in humans are widely considered to be remarkable. Handedness is a behavioral consequence of functional asymmetries in the brain, with right-handedness resulting from unilateral specializations in the left hemisphere and vice versa. In anthropoid primates, asymmetries of the precentral gyrus in the primary motor cortex show a particular association with hand preference at the individual level. However, the proximate reasons for the expression of individual manual lateralization in humans and other anthropoids, including its genetic basis and the influence of brain areas located outside of the motor cortex, are not fully understood.
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, hypersocial phenotype, and life-threatening cardiovascular abnormalities. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments to directly ameliorate the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a homeostatic modulatory system involved in various physiological functions at both central and peripheral levels, and its components have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, the researchers investigated the brain components of the ECS in the WBS CD model and found significant alterations in CB1R expression and G-protein coupling in specific brain regions. Moreover, subchronic administration of the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 normalized relevant behavioral phenotypes in CD mice, including social behavior and memory alterations, and partially restored cardiovascular deficits and cardiac transcriptional alterations found in the model. These results suggest that the modification of the endocannabinoid signaling could be a novel therapeutic strategy worth evaluating in the context of WBS. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.
In both humans and holometabolous insects, development occurs in a series of temporally regulated morphological stages that ultimately result in the adult form. In the case of holometabolous insects, immature juveniles transition to the adult form through an intermediate pupal stage, during which larval tissues are eliminated and adult structures are formed from imaginal progenitor cells. This process is regulated by the sequential expression of the transcription factors chinmo, Br-C, and E9
Co-substrate cycling, where a metabolite is converted among alternate forms through different reactions, is prevalent in metabolism and affects metabolic flux. This phenomenon imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct from the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalyzing that reaction. The additional limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. Regulation of these two parameters allows regulation of flux dynamics in branched and coupled pathways. Analysis of existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from central carbon metabolism identified several reactions that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. The limitations imposed by co-substrate cycling provide experimentally testable hypotheses on specific metabolic phenotypes. Measuring and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells. Cell metabolism dynamics directly influence individual and population-level cellular responses, such as metabolic oscillations, metabolic shifts from respiration to fermentation, and cell-to-cell cross-feeding. Reaction flux, a measure of the rate of biochemical conversion in a given reaction, plays a key role in understanding the limitations on reaction fluxes. Enzyme levels, media conditions, and cyclic reaction motifs, particularly those involving co-substrate pairs, are factors that influence metabolic system dynamics. Theoretical studies have shown that metabolic systems featuring metabolite cycling together with allosteric regulation can introduce switch-like and bistable dynamics, and that metabolite cycling motifs introduce total co-substrate level as an additional control element in metabolic control analysis. Specific analyses of ATP cycling in the glycolysis pathway and metabolite cycling with autocatalysis have shown that these features constrain pathway fluxes. Co-substrate cycling could provide a key 'design feature' in cell metabolism, imposing certain constraints or dynamical properties to it.
The development and differentiation of articular chondrocytes, a type of cartilage cell found in joints, is poorly understood and differentiated from growth-plate cartilage. A study found that NFATc1, a regulator of T-cell activation, is crucial for articular but not growth-plate chondrocyte differentiation. NFATc1-expressing cells were located in the flanking region of the joint interzone during knee development and generated almost all articular chondrocytes. These cells displayed prominent capacities for colony formation and multipotent differentiation. NFATc1 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene, thus determining articular chondrocyte differentiation. GDF5 is a gene used for tracking synovial joint and articular cartilage development, but it cannot be used postnatally as its expression is greatly diminished in articular cartilage in neonatal mice. PRG4 is an articular cartilage progenitor marker in the late stage of synovial joint development and encodes lubricin, a major component of synovial fluid. PRG4 starts to predominantly express and function at the late stage of articular cartilage development and is a marker for postnatal and adult articular cartilage progenitors. SOX9 is essential for chondrogenesis but its detailed functions and mechanisms in articular cartilage development remain unclear. NFATc1 is a suppressor of chondrogenesis in entheseal progenitors and is constantly expressed in articular cartilage progenitors. The expression of NFATc1 is diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppressing NFATc1 in articular cartilage progenitors is sufficient to induce spontaneous chondrocyte differentiation through regulating the transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene. These findings provide novel insights into the identity and origin of articular chondrocytes and the fundamental function of NFATc1 in determining physiological articular chondrocyte differentiation.
Photosystem II (PSII) is a key enzyme in oxygenic photosynthesis, responsible for converting energy from sunlight into chemical energy. The near-universal type of PSII contains 35 chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and 2 pheophytins a (Phe) and operates using red light. However, certain cyanobacteria have adapted to lower energy levels by using chlorophyll d (Chl-d) or chlorophyll f (Chl-f) instead of Chl-a. These types of PSII, found in Acaryochloris marina (Chl-d-PSII) and Chroococcidiopsis thermalis (Chl-f-PSII), have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover but differ in their susceptibility to photodamage. Chl-d-PSII has a modified energy gap on the acceptor side that favors recombination and singlet oxygen production, making it more sensitive to high-light damage. On the other hand, Chl-f-PSII has tuned acceptor-side energy gaps that avoid harmful back reactions, making it more resilient to photodamage. These adaptations come with functional penalties, such as decreased photochemical efficiency or loss of resilience to photodamage. Understanding these trade-offs is important for engineering far-red photosynthesis into other organisms of agricultural or technological interest. The electron transfer properties of Chl-a-PSII, Chl-f-PSII, and Chl-d-PSII were compared using isolated membranes to minimize the effects of physiological differences between strains. The results showed that the forward electron transfer rates from QA- to QB/QB- are not significantly different in the three types of PSII, but the S2QA- recombination is slower in Chl-f-PSII of FR C. thermalis compared to Chl-a-PSII of WL C. thermalis and Chl-d-PSII of A. marina. The efficiency of PSII water oxidation activity was also found to be comparable in all three types of PSII. Charge recombination reactions were investigated by monitoring thermoluminescence and luminescence emissions, which showed that both Chl-f-PSII and Chl-d-PSII are more luminescent than Chl-a-PSII, with Chl-f-PSII being the most luminescent. Despite the large difference in TL intensity, the peak temperatures corresponding to the S2QB- and S2QA- recombination were both similar in Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII, while the S2QA- peak was lower in Chl-d-PSII.
The skeletal system is a complex organ system that includes bones, bone marrow, and other connective tissues, and is responsible for functions such as movement, support, hematopoiesis, immune responses, and endocrine regulation. The skeletal system contains multiple cell lineages that arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), including osteoblasts, bone marrow adipocytes, osteoclasts, B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and others. During aging, there is an imbalance between myeloid-lymphoid hematopoiesis and adipo-osteogenic differentiation, leading to increased myelopoiesis and adipogenesis as opposed to lymphopoiesis and osteogenesis.Osteocytes, the long-living terminally differentiated cells and the most abundant cells within the bone matrix, play vital roles in maintaining the skeletal homeostasis. They have been shown to regulate bone formation, bone resorption, bone marrow hematopoiesis, and generate endocrine signals to mediate function of other organs. Osteocytes regulate both the osteoblast and osteoclast activities during bone remodeling. Ablation of osteocytes in mice has been shown to cause impairment of osteogenesis and lymphopoiesis, and increased osteoclastogenesis and mobilization of myelopoiesis toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes. These changes result in the induction of accelerated skeletal aging.In a study using a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes by the expression of diphtheria toxin subunit α in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)-positive osteocytes, it was demonstrated that partial ablation of DMP1-positive osteocytes caused severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan in these animals. Osteocytes reduction altered mesenchymal lineage commitment, resulting in impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogensis. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed that hematopoietic lineage was mobilized toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes, while the lymphopoiesis was impaired with reduced B cells in the osteocyte ablation mice.In conclusion, osteocytes play critical roles in regulation of lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow through mediation of senescence. The ablation of osteocytes leads to an imbalance in hematopoiesis and osteogenesis, resulting in the induction of accelerated skeletal aging.
The long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) on Escherichia coli, where 12 replicate populations have been adapting to a carbon-limited medium for over 75,000 generations, provides a valuable model to study the molecular changes underlying adaptation. Previous studies have shown that while the replicate populations display similar phenotypic changes, there is significant diversity at the genomic level. Here, the authors use RNA-seq and Ribo-seq to profile the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes after 50,000 generations of evolution in the LTEE. They aim to answer five fundamental questions, including whether evolved lines show similar transcriptomic and translatomic changes, how changes in cell size affect changes in absolute expression levels, whether changes in gene expression at the translational level buffer, augment, or match changes at the transcriptional level, what classes of genes or pathways are altered in the evolved lines, and whether mutations responsible for parallel changes in gene expression across replicate populations can be identified.The authors find that despite acquiring mostly unique sets of mutations, evolved lines show similar transcriptomic and translatomic changes after 50,000 generations. Changes in cell size affect changes in absolute expression levels, with larger cells having higher biomass and proportionally higher nucleic acid levels, leading to increased mRNA abundance per cell. The increases in mRNA abundance scale with cellular volume, suggesting that the evolved lines have more mRNA per cell than the ancestors. Most genes have increased mRNA abundance per CFU compared to the ancestor, and these differences were significantly larger than the differences between biological replicates. Changes in ribosome densities are highly correlated with changes in mRNA abundances, but individual genes might have altered ribosome densities. However, most changes happen at the transcriptional level with insufficient evidence for significant changes at the translational level. Genome-wide average codon-specific ribosome densities show a high correlation between replicates, and densities at stop codons are lower in evolved lines than in the ancestor, indicating potentially faster translation termination. Accounting for line-specific effects, the stop codon effect sizes for each evolved line range from –0.088 to –0.657 log fold-change units, indicating that stop codons in all evolved lines have a decreased ribosome density compared to the ancestor. This suggests that the translation termination rate increased across all evolved lines, but it remains unclear if these regulatory changes can evolve in more complex environments.
The study reports that in mouse liver regeneration, hepatocytes with impaired RTK-Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling form clusters and express CD133, a widely viewed cancer stem cell marker associated with drug resistance and cancer recurrence. These hepatocytes are negative for other progenitor cell markers. Pharmaceutical inhibition of proliferative signaling induces CD133 expression in various cancer cell types from multiple animal species, suggesting an inherent and common mechanism of stress response. Super-resolution and electron microscopy localize CD133 on intracellular vesicles, which the researchers named 'intercellsome.' Isolated CD133+ intercellsomes are enriched with mRNAs rather than miRNAs. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals lower intracellular diversity of mitogenic mRNAs in Shp2-deficient cells, which may be remedied by intercellular mRNA exchanges between CD133+ cells. CD133-deficient cells are more sensitive to proliferative signal inhibition in livers and intestinal organoids. The study suggests a mechanism of intercellular communication to compensate for intracellular signal deficit in various cell types. The researchers used liver regeneration as an animal model to dissect mechanisms that drive cell proliferation in vivo, as it has a unique regenerative capacity conserved from animals to humans. They found that in Shp2-deficient livers, actively dividing hepatocytes formed distinctive clusters and highly expressed CD133, but were negative for other stem/progenitor cell markers. The CD133+ cell colonies appeared transiently following PHx and disappeared quickly after the completion of liver regeneration. This phenotype was also observed in MET-deficient livers following liver injuries. CD133 expression was upregulated by proliferative signal inhibition in a variety of cancer cell lines from different organs, indicating a commonly shared mechanism. Remarkably, the researchers identified and isolated CD133+ intracellular vesicles, which were enriched with transcripts of immediate early responsive genes (IEGs) and migrated between tightly contacting cells in colonies. Single-cell RNA-sequencing demonstrated that cells defective for proliferative signaling exhibited lower intracellular transcriptional diversity (entropy), which was remedied in CD133+ cells, potentially by converting intercellular heterogeneity into intracellular diversity through sharing of mRNAs. These data suggest a new function of CD133 in intercellular communication, by which normal and cancer cells endeavor to proliferate under proliferative signal deficit.
The study reports the use of retinal organoids differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to screen for drug candidates that can maintain photoreceptor survival in retinal ciliopathies, specifically in Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) type 10 caused by mutations in the cilia-centrosomal gene CEP290. The researchers identified five non-toxic small molecules, with reserpine being the lead molecule, that maintained photoreceptor development and survival in rd16 organoids, which is a model of LCA10. Reserpine also improved photoreceptors in patient organoids and in rd16 mouse retina in vivo. Further investigation revealed that reserpine partially restored the balance between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, resulting in improved primary cilium assembly. The study highlights the impact of proteostasis in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies and provides new insights for treatments of retinal neurodegeneration. The primary cilium, once considered vestigial, is now known to be a key microtubule-based organelle that senses the external environment and modulates diverse signaling pathways in multiple tissues. Aberrant cilium biogenesis and/or ciliary transport and functions lead to numerous diseases, collectively termed ciliopathies, which manifest from sensory abnormalities to syndromic disorders with multi-organ pathologies. The mammalian retina is an extension of the central nervous system that is specialized for vision, and the visual information is captured by rod and cone photoreceptors, integrated and processed by interneurons, and transmitted to the cortex through the retinal ganglion cells. Inability of the retinal photoreceptors to detect and/or transmit light-triggered signals is a major cause of vision impairment in retinal and macular degenerative diseases. Mutations in over 200 genes can lead to inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), with a combined prevalence of 1/3–4000 individuals. Among them, up to 20% of IRD-causing genes are involved in primary cilium biogenesis or functions. Treatment options for IRD are limited, and only one gene therapy drug is currently approved by the FDA for LCA caused by RPE65 mutations. Thus, gene-agnostic paradigms are being developed for retinal and macular diseases using model organisms and/or stem cell-based approaches. Small-molecule or antibody drugs represent a relatively affordable and scalable option. However, over 90% of drug candidates fail in Phase I clinical trials due to the lack of effective model systems which faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of human diseases. The limited number of cells in the retina and challenges in the maintenance of primary retinal cultures have also hindered the progress of therapeutic development.
Bees are exposed to various xenobiotics, including plant metabolites, while foraging for nectar and pollen. Although bees have a genome that encodes enzymes for xenobiotic metabolism, it has lower detoxification gene diversity than other insects. Therefore, bees may rely on their gut microbiota to degrade potentially toxic molecules. A study found that amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in honey bee-pollinated almond trees, can be metabolized by both bees and members of the gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In microbiota-colonized bees, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut, suggesting that the microbiota contributes to the full degradation of amygdalin into hydrogen cyanide. In vitro experiments demonstrated that amygdalin degradation by bee gut bacteria is strain-specific and not characteristic of a particular genus or species. Strains of Bifidobacterium, Bombilactobacillus, and Gilliamella can degrade amygdalin, and the degradation mechanism appears to vary since only some strains produce prunasin as an intermediate. The study highlights the importance of both host and microbiota in metabolizing dietary plant metabolites and their potential consequences for animal health.
Candida albicans, a significant fungal threat to human health, causes invasive candidiasis and damages target cell membranes using the virulence factor candidalysin (CL). However, the mechanism by which CL permeabilizes membranes was unclear. Recent research reveals that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism, where it readily assembles into polymers in solution. The basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer, which is sequentially added into a string configuration that can close into a loop. These CL loops appear to spontaneously insert into the membrane to become pores. A CL mutation (G4W) inhibited the formation of polymers in solution and prevented pore formation in synthetic lipid systems. Epithelial cell studies showed that G4W CL failed to activate the danger response pathway, a hallmark of the pathogenic effect of CL. These results indicate that CL polymerization in solution is a necessary step for the damage of cellular membranes. CL polymerization has been identified as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis. Fungal infections, particularly those caused by C. albicans, result in high morbidity burdens worldwide. CL, a peptide toxin secreted by C. albicans, plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis by binding to the plasma membrane of target human epithelial cells and compromising the permeability barrier. Pharmacological inhibition of CL activity is a promising avenue to fight infection of this human pathogen; however, the development of drugs to counter the action of CL is hampered by the lack of understanding of how this peptide damages membranes. The use of biophysical techniques, modeling, and cellular assays has elucidated that CL damages membranes by forming pores that are assembled through a unique molecular mechanism. This discovery not only unravels a new paradigm for the formation of membrane pores but additionally identifies CL polymerization as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis.
The effectiveness of tailored interventions in healthcare, particularly in precision medicine, has been attributed to both pharmacological personalization and non-specific contextual factors involved in the tailoring process. However, the extent to which these contextual factors contribute to the overall effectiveness remains unclear. A study was conducted to investigate the impact of framing a sham treatment as personalized on its effectiveness. The study found that participants who were told that the machine was personalized to their genetics and physiology reported more relief in pain intensity and unpleasantness compared to the control group. This suggests that contextual factors, such as patient beliefs and expectations, can significantly influence the effectiveness of a treatment. The findings could potentially improve the methodology of precision medicine research and inform clinical practice. Precision medicine, which tailors interventions to patients' specific genetic, biological, and behavioral markers, has shown promising results in conditions such as cancer. However, the role of contextual factors in precision medicine remains unexplored. Research in placebo science has shown that contextual factors, such as verbal suggestions, patient expectations, social cues, and observational learning, can increase the effectiveness of interventions and reduce side effects. Precision medicine may already benefit from greater patient expectations and increased trust due to the public's high hopes for the field. Providing genetic and physiological feedback and using it to tailor a treatment may similarly influence outcomes for precision therapies. The personalization process in precision medicine may implicitly suggest stronger perceived treatment effectiveness by harnessing factors well-known to increase the placebo effect. Despite the similarities between the ideal contextual factors for strong placebo effects and the typical contextual factors involved in precision medicine, the influence of the personalization process on perceived treatment effectiveness is largely unknown. Thus, the study tested whether believing that a treatment is tailored to one's physiology and genetics may improve its perceived efficacy. The study found that participants receiving a placebo they thought was personalized reported nearly twice the reduction in pain intensity and unpleasantness compared to the control group. These findings suggest that the personalization process can significantly influence the perception of treatment effectiveness and have implications beyond the field of precision medicine and healthcare.
Shared lineage can have diverse effects on neuronal connectivity patterns. In the mammalian cortex, excitatory sister neurons assemble into shared microcircuits, while in Drosophila, sister neurons with different levels of Notch expression develop distinct identities and diverge into separate circuits. The integration of sister neurons in vertebrate systems remains unclear. A study was conducted to evaluate how sister V2a (NotchOFF) /V2b (NotchON) neurons in the zebrafish spinal cord integrate into circuits. The results showed that sister V2a/b neurons have somata in close proximity to each other and similar axonal trajectories, but receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. This represents the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system. Overall, the integration of sister neurons into circuits is complex and can result in both shared and distinct circuit integration, depending on the specific system and expression of factors such as Notch.
Homeostatic plasticity is crucial for stable neuronal network activity, but its magnitude can be destabilizing if activated inappropriately or excessively. Prolonged activity deprivation can lead to rebound hyperactivity and seizures. The PARbZIP family of transcription factors, including Hlf, Tef, and Dbp, regulates cortical network homeostasis. In their absence, the network response to activity withdrawal is stronger, and miniature excitatory synaptic currents are exaggerated due to enhanced upregulation of recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission. Hlf and Tef are critical for constraining plasticity and preventing life-threatening seizures. These findings suggest that transcriptional activation is required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity and is also involved in restraining the response to activity deprivation.
In the developing respiratory system of mice, the tips of the respiratory buds contain important progenitor cells marked by the expression of SOX9 and ID2. During early embryonic development, these SOX9+ progenitors are multipotent and can generate both airway and alveolar epithelium. However, as development progresses, they become selective progenitors of alveolar epithelial cells. The transition of these progenitors is controlled by complex gene regulatory networks involving various transcription factors, including Sox9, Etv5, Irx, Mycn, and Foxp1/2. These transcription factors interact with signaling pathways to establish and maintain cell-type identity, although the molecular mechanisms are not well-defined.To study the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data were analyzed from SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) during embryonic development in Mus musculus. Widespread changes in chromatin accessibility were observed between E11.5 and E16.5, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers. A common SOX9+ progenitor gene regulatory network (GRN) was identified, implicating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+ progenitor cells. Consistent with this model, conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mouse resulted in an expansion of the SOX9+ EPC population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation. These data demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis and highlight the combinatorial power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development.Lung morphogenesis begins as an outpouching of a simple bud from the embryonic foregut, which branches and extends into the splanchnic mesoderm as the primitive respiratory tubules are formed. The tips of the lung bud are lined by highly proliferative epithelial progenitor cells marked by the expression of Sox9 and Id2. SOX9+ progenitor cells give rise to the entire complement of lung epithelium, from proximal airway epithelial cells to distal type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells.Chromatin accessibility changes dynamically throughout development, establishing and maintaining cellular identity in a variety of cell types and organ systems. Chromatin accessibility, or the degree to which nuclear macromolecules are able to physically interact with chromatinized DNA, can now be measured using Assay for Transposible-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq). In this study, paired RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq were used to define the chromatin accessibility landscape of developing SOX9+ lung epithelial progenitor cells at multiple development timepoints. Accessible chromatin regions in SOX9+ cells were highly correlated with lung-specific histone post-translational modifications found on validated cis-regulatory elements. Dynamic changes in these accessible chromatin regions were correlated with gene expression changes observed during the course of SOX9+ lung epithelial cell differentiation.In summary, the study analyzed the role of SOX9+ progenitor cells in lung development and the molecular mechanisms underlying their transition. The data demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis and highlight the importance of chromatin accessibility in defining regulatory networks in development. The findings provide new insights into the regulatory networks and signaling pathways involved in lung epithelial development and cell fate specification.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disorder that affects the central nervous system, leading to a progressive neurodegenerative state with heterogeneous clinical characteristics. Cognitive dysfunction is a common clinical manifestation of MS, which negatively impacts different aspects of patients’ daily life. Working memory (WM), a crucial cognitive domain, is often affected in MS, and it is one of the main areas of research due to its essential role in several cognitive processes.Traditionally, WM has been studied using the binary slot model, assuming a short-term storage for a limited number of items in a binary format. However, recent observations from analog recall paradigms have shown that assuming dynamic allocation of WM resources, known as the resource model, provides more accurate predictions in WM assessment. Continuous reproduction paradigms, such as memory-guided localization (MGL) and analog recall tasks with sequential presentation, allow for assessing the distribution of error in recalling information, providing new insights into the organization of the WM system.A study investigating WM dysfunction in MS using MGL and sequential analog recall tasks found that MS patients had an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision. Sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy control from relapsing-remitting MS, while MGL was more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes (relapsing-remitting from secondary progressive). Computational modeling of the results from the sequential paradigm determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error (mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items) was responsible for WM dysfunction in MS. This study provided a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit and new insights into the organization of the WM system in the MS population.
Nociception, the neural process that detects potentially tissue-damaging stimuli, is conserved across the animal kingdom, while the brain-mediated modulation of nociception is less understood in non-mammalian species. A study on Drosophila melanogaster discovered a descending inhibitory mechanism of nociception from the brain, mediated by the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) that plays an important role in the descending control of nociception in mammals. Mutants lacking dsk or its receptors were hypersensitive to noxious heat, and a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception was identified. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system, suggesting that descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception. Nociception and descending inhibition are critical in understanding the molecular and neural mechanisms implementing adaptive behaviors and their evolution, as well as human pain mechanisms.
The study discusses the arms race between plants and infectious fungi, where fungi have developed strategies to overcome the toxic compounds produced by plants as a defense mechanism. The focus is on rocaglates, antifungal secondary metabolites produced by Aglaia plants, which have antifungal and antitumor properties and are potentially effective against viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and hepatitis E virus. Rocaglates target eIF4A, a DEAD-box RNA binding protein, and function as potent translation inhibitors. A parasitic fungus able to grow on Aglaia plants was found, contrary to the expectation that rocaglates would prevent fungal infection. This fungus, Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1, has an amino acid substitution in the rocaglate binding site of eIF4A, making it resistant to rocaglates and allowing it to infect plants even in the presence of this compound. This highlights a unique contest between plants and fungi centered on secondary metabolites synthesized in the host plant and shows that fungi can develop resistance to plant secondary metabolites independent of detoxification enzymes.
Psychophysical methods, which include controlled experiments and rigorous analysis through signal detection theory, are used in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience to quantify behavior and its neural correlates for various mental phenomena. However, these methods require many tedious trials and preferably highly trained participants. A new approach called continuous psychophysics aims to transform the field by replacing rigid trial structures and binary responses with continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli. This approach not only requires less time but also results in more natural and suitable tasks for untrained subjects. However, current analysis methods for continuous psychophysics do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task. To address this issue, a computational analysis framework based on Bayesian inverse optimal control has been introduced, which recovers perceptual thresholds and estimates subjects’ action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. This framework provides further evidence for the importance of including acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and intrinsic costs of behavior in experiments seemingly only investigating perception.
The understanding of brain decision-making has been advanced by models based on normative principles, but these models have typically been derived for simple and stable conditions, with unclear relevance to more naturalistic, dynamic conditions. A normative decision model was previously derived where evidence accumulation adapts to fluctuations in the evidence-generating process during a single decision, but the evolution of commitment rules under dynamic conditions is not fully understood. This study derives a normative model for decisions based on changing contexts, defined as changes in evidence quality or reward over the course of a single decision. Performance (reward rate) is maximized using decision thresholds that respond to and even anticipate these changes, in contrast to the static thresholds used in many decision models. Adaptive thresholds exhibit several distinct temporal motifs that depend on the specific predicted and experienced context changes. Adaptive models perform robustly even when implemented imperfectly and outperform those with constant or urgency-gated thresholds in accounting for human response times on a task with time-varying evidence quality and average reward. These results further link normative and neural decision-making while expanding the view of both as dynamic, adaptive processes that update and use expectations to govern both deliberation and commitment.
Biodiversity loss is a major global issue, with freshwater ecosystems suffering the greatest biodiversity loss due to human activities such as agricultural land use, climate change, invasive species, pollution, and unsustainable production and consumption. A study on Lake Ring, a freshwater ecosystem in Denmark, used artificial intelligence and a conceptual framework to examine the links between biodiversity dynamics and abiotic environmental changes over 100 years. The study used multilocus metabarcoding and mass spectrometry analysis on a dated sedimentary archive, along with biocides sale records and climate records, to identify drivers of functional biodiversity changes across major ecosystem shifts. The results showed that insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. The community-level biodiversity approach used in this study reliably explained freshwater ecosystem shifts, which were not observed when using traditional quality indices. The study highlights the importance of using high-throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends over species-focused ecological surveys to identify the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions. Biodiversity is crucial for provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services, which underpin economic prosperity, social well-being, and quality of life. However, global biodiversity has been lost at an alarming rate in the past century, leading to what some have called the sixth mass extinction. Biodiversity is threatened by various anthropogenic drivers, and studies on multitrophic levels are critical to understand the context-dependency of biodiversity-ecosystem functions relationships and to implement management measures to conserve biodiversity.
The brain's ability to quickly respond to the dynamic world is crucial for survival, but it is complicated by neural transmission delays from sensory organs to the brain and additional delays during cortical processing. The brain can compensate for these delays through prediction, using information from the past to predict the present. This is particularly relevant in motion perception, as the future positions of a predictably moving object can be determined by its current acceleration, velocity, and position. Predictive processes help to compensate for neural delays incurred before visual input reaches the visual cortex and for delays during subsequent cortical processing. Neurophysiological recordings in animals reveal motion extrapolation mechanisms as early as the retina, with retinal ganglion cells responding to the leading edge of moving stimuli and extrapolating their represented position. These extrapolated representations are thought to be transmitted to the visual cortex, allowing for the position of a moving object to be represented with reduced latency. However, it is unclear whether similar mechanisms operate along the cortical visual processing hierarchy to compensate for additional delays. A study using time-resolved EEG decoding found that early position representations of moving objects are in close alignment with the veridical position of the object, providing the first direct evidence in humans that extrapolation processes allow the early visual system to localize moving objects in real-time. However, during the course of cortical visual processing, position representations increasingly lag behind real-time stimulus position as information progresses through the visual hierarchy. This suggests that delay compensation is primarily achieved at very early stages of stimulus processing, and that subsequent cortical visual areas do not implement further compensation for neural delays. Nevertheless, this early compensation ensures that the represented position of a moving object throughout the entire visual hierarchy is far more up-to-date than could be expected based on the latencies of neural responses to static objects. These findings demonstrate the existence of significant predictive processing during motion perception, but constrain any predictive mechanisms to acting relatively early in processing.
The human brain's unique ability to derive knowledge from language inputs, combined with nonlinguistic sensory channels such as vision and touch, is a significant factor in how semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain. A study investigating this question used early deaf adults who were born to hearing parents and had reduced early exposure and delayed acquisition of any natural human language as a unique human model. The study found that the deaf group with reduced early language exposure, compared with the deaf control group, showed reduced semantic sensitivity in both multivariate pattern and univariate analyses in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL). These results suggest that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the dATL, highlighting the roles of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences. Modern neurocognitive theories of semantics suggest that semantic knowledge is ultimately grounded in nonlinguistic sensory/motor experiences, encoded in distributed brain areas encompassing high-level sensorimotor areas. However, language experiences may contribute to semantic development beyond sensory experiences by facilitating or modulating categorizations by the nature of labeling (i.e. words) to the sensory experiences and/or by constructing semantic relations based on various types of word relations. Neural representations of fully nonsensory, language-derived knowledge have only recently been inferred based on studies with sensory-deprived individuals. Congenitally blind individuals can acquire semantic structures about visual-specific knowledge behaviorally similar to those in the sighted, presumably derived from language, represented in the dATL. The left dATL is also more strongly activated by abstract than concrete words in typically developed individuals, suggesting that this area represents knowledge derived from language, in addition to those from sensory experiences. Despite these documented effects of delayed L1 acquisition on phonology, morphology, and syntax, studies have reported little effects on semantic behaviors. Neural changes may not necessarily lead to semantic behavioral changes as semantic processing is supported by a multifaceted cognitive system and a complex neural network entailing distributed brain regions. A study using fMRI experiments on semantic processing of familiar words compared the neural semantic structures between congenitally deaf signers with delayed sign language acquisition and congenitally deaf signers with native sign language acquisition, that is, two groups that are matched on their nonlinguistic sensory experiences but varied in early language experience. Significant group differences would provide positive evidence for the role of language experience in the formation of the identified neural semantic structures.
The hippocampus plays a key role in encoding and consolidating episodic memories, with hippocampal place cells activated in sequential patterns during behavioral episodes. These place cells reactivate during offline periods, such as sleep, in a phenomenon called replay, which is crucial for systems-level memory consolidation. Replay has been typically defined by the sequential reactivation of place cell ensembles, known as place representation. However, place cells also carry additional information in the magnitude of their place field’s activity, or rate representation, which is modulated by contextual cues, behavioral variables, and cognitive events. This study by Daniel et al. (2021) investigated whether rate modulation is reinstated during replay, which would suggest that replay could serve a larger role in memory processes by providing a richer, more complete memory trace.The researchers recorded extracellularly from the dorsal CA1 of rats as they ran back and forth along two novel linear tracks. They observed global remapping of place cells between the two linear tracks and found that both the context (which linear track) and current position could be inferred from place cell activity with high accuracy using a naïve Bayes decoder. The study then focused on whether the contextually driven place fields’ rate modulation between tracks is conserved during offline replay. They found that any contextually driven rate modulation between two behavioral episodes is maintained during offline replay, and this observation was consistent over a wide range of alterations in the criteria used for selecting neurons, place fields, and replay events. These results suggest that replay could serve a larger role in memory processes, providing a richer, more complete memory trace.In summary, this study by Daniel et al. (2021) has provided evidence for the reinstatement of rate modulation during replay, suggesting that replay could serve a larger role in memory processes. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the hippocampal mechanisms underlying memory consolidation and raises the possibility that replay could provide a richer, more complete memory trace.
The study reveals that impaired spermatogenesis and male infertility are prevalent issues associated with mitochondrial diseases, and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions remain unclear. The study focuses on PARL-deficient mice as a novel model of mitochondrial encephalopathy resembling Leigh syndrome. The research demonstrates that PARL deficiency in male mice leads to early testicular atrophy caused by a complete arrest of spermatogenesis during meiotic prophase I, followed by degeneration and death of arrested spermatocytes. This process is independent of neurodegeneration. The mitochondrial dysfunction in PARL-deficient spermatocytes is associated with severe abnormalities in mitochondrial ultrastructure, prominent electron transfer chain defects, disrupted coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, and metabolic rewiring. These mitochondrial defects are associated with a germ cell-specific decrease in GPX4 expression, leading arrested spermatocytes to ferroptosis – a regulated cell death modality characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. The findings suggest that mitochondrial defects induced by PARL depletion act as an initiating trigger for ferroptosis in primary spermatocytes through simultaneous effects on GPX4 and CoQ – two major inhibitors of ferroptosis. The research sheds new light on the potential role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and male infertility, warranting further investigation.
The hepatokine FGF21, which has lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties, is a promising potential therapeutic for treating NASH. FGF21's specificity for various metabolic tissues is determined by the FGF receptor (FGFR) forming a heterodimer with the transmembrane co-receptor β-Klotho (KLB). While the FGFR is widely expressed, KLB is primarily expressed in the liver and adipose tissue, potentially limiting FGF21 action to these tissues. In NASH, a metabolic liver disease, lipids accumulate in the liver, leading to impaired liver function and progressing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatments for NASH are limited to lifestyle modifications and liver transplantation. FGF21 levels are stress-induced and correlate with the severity of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in patients with NASH. Pharmacological FGF21 treatment improves liver steatosis in NASH patients. A study using APOE\*3-Leiden . CETP mice, which develop fibrotic NASH closely resembling clinical features in humans, found that liver-specific FGF21 overexpression activates hepatic signaling associated with FA oxidation and cholesterol removal, reduces adipose tissue inflammation, and protects against adipose tissue dysfunction, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. FGF21 also limits lipid accumulation in the liver, prevents hepatic KC activation, and reduces monocyte recruitment, thereby preventing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in the liver. FGF21 reduces the number of pro-fibrotic macrophages in the injured liver, potentially explaining why FGF21 counteracts all features of NASH, including hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrogenesis.
Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) is an open-source data language for neurophysiology that enables the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) of diverse neurophysiology data. NWB is designed to address the challenges presented by the immense heterogeneity and evolution of neurophysiology data and metadata. It is a flexible and extensible data language that can co-evolve with neurophysiology experiments and can store multimodal neurophysiology data and derived products in a single file with easy visualization tools. NWB is foundational for the Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI) data repository and is integrated with a growing ecosystem of state-of-the-art analysis tools. It is being utilized by more than 53 labs and research organizations for all neurophysiology data modalities collected from species ranging from flies to humans during diverse tasks. NWB files contain all of the measurements for a single experiment, along with all of the necessary metadata to understand that data. It can describe and store many data sources, including neurophysiological recordings, behavior, and stimulation information, in a unified way that is readily analyzed with all time bases aligned to a common clock. The NWB software architecture provides flexible accommodation of the heterogenous use cases and needs of NWB users through a core software stack with four modularized components: the specification language, the data standard schema, data use APIs, and storage backends.
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to respiratory tract disease and neurological disturbances such as encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. A study using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on mice infected with H1N1 virus found that the hypothalamus, a central regulator of homeostatic responses during viral challenge, exhibited transcriptional changes in all identified cell populations. The most pronounced transcriptional response occurred 3 days post-infection, with a strong downregulation of genes across all cell types. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, showed increased numbers of cells expressing pro-inflammatory gene networks. Neuronal cell populations downregulated genes contributing to energy homeostasis in mitochondria and protein translation in the cytosol, indicating potential reduced cellular and neuronal activity. These changes might be preventive measures in neuronal cells to avoid intracellular viral replication and attack by phagocytosing cells, complemented by a shift in microglia activity to provide increased surveillance of their surroundings. IAV infections have been associated with neurological consequences in humans and other species, with H1N1 strains identified as the causal agent for pandemics in 1918 and 2009. Non-neurotropic IAV strains, like the H1N1 strain from the 2009 pandemic, can infiltrate the brain and cause neurological disturbances through indirect effects rather than direct viral infection of brain cells. Cytokines produced during a peripheral infection can reach the brain and cause functional disturbances, and microglia become activated during peripheral IAV infections with non-neurotropic strains. The hypothalamus, a functional integrator of peripheral signals, regulates several physiological and behavioral functions via specialized nuclei. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) are involved in feeding, body temperature, sleep-wake states, circadian rhythms, metabolism, and pain perception. Studies have shown transcriptional changes in the hypothalamus during environmental perturbations, but little is known about how the transcriptome of these cell types changes during IAV infection. A study using snRNA-seq on mice infected with H1N1 pdm09 found changes in all populations during the peak of disease, with a change in cell state in microglia at early infection and strong effects in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes later on. After recovery, all non-neuronal cell types returned to their resting state, while neurons exhibited long-lasting changes of the transcriptome even after full recovery.
In studying the link between apical-basal cell polarity loss and cell plasticity in epithelial tumorigenesis, researchers performed single-cell RNA sequencing of Drosophila ovaries with polarity-gene l(2)gl knockdown (Lgl-KD), which causes invasive multilayering of the follicular epithelia. They identified a genetic requirement of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in promoting multilayer formation and increased volume of delaminated follicle cells with enhanced invasive behavior and significant cytoskeleton changes. The study highlights the comprehensive transcriptome of cells within the follicle cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and identifies a previously unappreciated link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis. This discovery has implications for understanding and treating epithelial cancers, which often involve disrupted cell polarity and increased cell plasticity.
Humans learn about their environment through both direct interaction and by seeking information from social sources like conspecifics. The confidence level in the information obtained should determine the impact it has on changing and adapting behavior. This study examined the differences in behavioral and neural computations during non-social learning compared to learning from social sources. Trial-wise confidence judgments about non-social and social information sources offered insight into this learning process. Confidence judgments were more accurate and less changeable when made about social as opposed to non-social information sources. Differences were also apparent in the Bayesian estimates of participants’ subjective beliefs. Univariate activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction more closely tracked confidence about social as opposed to non-social information sources. Additionally, the multivariate patterns of activity in the same areas encoded identities of social information sources compared to non-social information sources. These findings suggest that while both social and non-social learning depend on common neural mechanisms, the neural mechanisms that support learning from social advice may be partially specialized and distinct from those concerned with learning guided by non-social sources. Differences between social and non-social learning can be investigated on different levels, such as the input level, algorithmic level, or neural implementation level. At the algorithmic level, associative learning mechanisms may be similar across social and non-social learning, while differences may emerge due to goal-directed actions being attributed to social agents. Some parts of the brain, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction, have been shown to be specialized for negotiating social situations.
Synaptic communication is a complex process that relies on the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, leading to neurotransmitter release. This exocytosis is triggered by brief and local elevations of intracellular Ca2+ with remarkably high sensitivity, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Synaptotagmins are thought to confer the Ca2+ sensitivity of neurotransmitter exocytosis, but biochemical measurements have reported Ca2+ affinities that are too low to account for synaptic function. However, recent research suggests that synaptotagmin’s Ca2+ affinity increases upon binding to the plasma membrane phospholipid PI (4,5) P2, and that this binding also increases synaptotagmin’s PI (4,5) P2 affinity. Based on these findings, a molecular exocytosis model has been proposed, which suggests that synaptotagmin’s Ca2+/PI (4,5) P2 dual-binding lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion, and that the effect of multiple synaptotagmins on the energy barrier is additive. This model, which relies on biochemically measured Ca2+/PI (4,5) P2 affinities and protein copy numbers, has been shown to reproduce the steep Ca2+ dependency of neurotransmitter release. Overall, these findings suggest that allosterically stabilized Ca2+/PI (4,5) P2 dual binding enables synaptotagmins to exert their coordinated function in neurotransmission.
Sauropterygia was a diverse and ecomorphologically varied clade of Mesozoic marine reptiles that spanned from the Early Triassic to the Late Cretaceous. Traditionally, sauropterygians are divided into two main groups with different body plans - the short-necked, durophagous Placodontia and the long-necked Eosauropterygia. Saurosphargidae, a small clade of armored marine reptiles, is considered the sauropterygian sister-group. However, the early evolutionary history of sauropterygians and their phylogenetic relationships with other groups within Diapsida remain incompletely understood. A new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic (Olenekian) of South China, Prosaurosphargis yingzishanensis, represents the earliest known occurrence of the clade. An updated phylogenetic analysis recovers saurosphargids as nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. This study provides evidence for the rapid diversification of sauropterygians in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event and emphasizes the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa. The early evolution of sauropterygians is crucial for understanding the phylogenetic uncertainty surrounding Archelosauria, a clade comprising turtles and archosauromorphs.
This passage discusses a study on the relationship between smoking and DNA methylation, which is a type of epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression. The study used data from the Netherlands Twin Register, which includes DNA methylation data for over 3000 whole-blood samples from twin families. The authors focused on monozygotic twin pairs, who are genetically identical, in order to control for genetic factors. They identified several discordant pairs, where one twin currently or formerly smoked and the other did not, as well as concordant pairs, where both twins had the same smoking status. After controlling for various factors, they found that there were differences in DNA methylation between smoking and non-smoking twins, particularly at certain loci that have been previously associated with smoking. These differences were more pronounced in current smokers compared to former smokers, and some of the differences were reversible upon quitting smoking. The authors also found that the degree of DNA methylation differences was correlated with the amount of cigarettes smoked. Additionally, they found that smoking-reactive methylation patterns were enriched at loci detected in previous EWASs of other traits and exposures, as well as at loci detected in a previous large GWAS meta-analysis of smoking initiation. These results suggest that DNA methylation may be a reactive mechanism to smoking, and that smoking cessation may lead to the reversal of some of these methylation changes.
The structure and function of the vertebrate retina have been extensively studied in isolated, ex vivo preparations, but its function in vivo, particularly in awake animals, remains less understood. To compare the output of awake, anesthetized, and ex vivo retinas, single-unit extracellular recordings were performed in the optic tract of head-fixed mice. The results showed that while the visual response properties were overall similar across conditions, awake retinal output had faster kinetics with less variability in response latencies, a larger dynamic range, and higher firing activity. Modeling analyses further showed that such awake response patterns convey comparable total information but less efficiently, and allow for a linear population decoder to perform significantly better than the anesthetized or ex vivo responses. These findings suggest that the retina employs dense coding in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as has been often assumed from ex vivo studies. The retina consists of approximately 100 cell types, including 30 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that send the retinal output signals to the brain via the optic nerve. Each RGC type forms distinct neural circuits within the retina to extract specific features of the visual image coming into the eye. Most of our knowledge on retinal function has been obtained from ex vivo studies, but they have certain limitations, such as the inability to perform long-term recordings, artifacts due to retinal dissection, and difficulties in studying neuromodulatory effects of retinopetal pathways. Therefore, in vivo studies are essential for understanding the retina's function in fully physiological conditions. Previous physiological studies on the retina in vivo were conducted mostly under anesthetized and paralyzed conditions, and only a handful of studies have reported awake recordings from the retina or its outputs. Thus, it remains unclear what exactly the eye tells the brain in awake animals. Recent studies have shown higher firing activity and faster response dynamics in both dLGN and the superior colliculus of awake animals than those under anesthesia, and it is unclear to what extent such differences originate in the retina. To clarify differences in the retinal visual response properties between awake and anesthetized conditions, single-unit extracellular recording techniques were employed from head-fixed mice. The recordings were made in the optic tract, a bundle of nerve fibers composed of RGC axons as they project from the eye to their main targets: dLGN and SC. These recordings are superior to direct in vivo retinal recordings or those extracellular recordings in SC or dLGN because the retinal circuits and the eye optics remain intact, and RGC axonal signals do not need to be disambiguated from those of local axons or somata. From the OT recordings, the visual responses to a set of visual stimuli were examined, and it was found that the temporal dynamics of the retinal outputs were slower in anesthetized conditions, and the retinal outputs in an awake condition had higher baseline firing rates and a larger dynamic range than in anesthetized or ex vivo conditions. These findings suggest that the retina may employ dense coding principles in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding or minimum energy principles that have been used as a model of the early visual processing.
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation, commonly used in biological techniques to preserve a snapshot of biomolecular transactions in living cells, can both enhance and diminish liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behaviors in fixed-cell imaging techniques such as immunofluorescence. This effect can cause artificial droplet-like puncta to appear in cells that do not have any detectable puncta in the live condition, and can be reversed by fixing cells in the presence of glycine. A kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein-protein interactions suggests that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and the difference between fixation rates of different proteins. Fast overall rates of fixation relative to protein-protein interaction dynamics can minimize fixation artifacts. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of PFA fixation on the appearance of LLPS and suggest a mechanism underlying the fixation artifact.
A human bladder-chip model was developed to study the dynamics of urinary tract infections (UTIs), specifically the formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) in the bladder. The chip model, consisting of umbrella cells and bladder microvascular endothelial cells co-cultured under flow in urine and nutritive media, mimics bladder filling and voiding mechanically. Time-lapse microscopy was used to observe the rapid recruitment of neutrophils from the vascular channel to sites of infection, leading to swarm and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, but not preventing IBC formation. Bacterial growth dynamics in individual IBCs were tracked through two cycles of antibiotic administration and recovery periods, revealing delayed elimination of bacteria within IBCs and rapid proliferation in a significant fraction of IBCs during the recovery period, reseeding new foci of infection. This highlights the importance of IBCs as harbors of bacterial persistence and the significance of antibiotic regimen compliance. UTIs are the second most common cause for antibiotic prescription, with a high frequency of recurrence impacting healthcare costs and quality of life. UPEC exhibits a complex lifestyle in the bladder, with planktonic sub-populations co-existing with intracellular bacteria. UPEC invasion generates substantial changes to bladder morphology and a robust immune response. IBCs play a prominent role in clinical infection and have been harvested from the urine of cystitis patients. However, long-term imaging of infected animals or explant-tissue is technically challenging, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes that underlie the formation of these structures and their impact on infection and clearance by subsequent antibiotic treatment. Organotypic models, such as the bladder-chip, are well-suited to address these outstanding questions.
The study of the cellular amination network in Escherichia coli reveals its high flexibility in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points. Ammonium is essential for generating the nitrogenous building blocks of life, and it gets assimilated via canonical biosynthetic routes to glutamate and is further distributed throughout metabolism via a network of transaminases. The study constructed an E. coli glutamate auxotrophic strain to systematically study which amino acids serve as amine sources and found that several amino acids complemented the auxotrophy by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. The network identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, the transaminase network was extended by the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources. The study also identified d-ammonium dehydrogenase (DadA) as an intracellular amino acid sink, removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine were also introduced. Nitrogen is essential for all forms of life, and its conversion from atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) by diazotrophic bacteria or industrially by the Haber–Bosch process is essential for assimilation by plants and other organisms to produce nitrogenous compounds. The introduction of ammonium (NH4+) into the building blocks of life is similar in all organisms and limited to the fixation of ammonium at the node between 2-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and glutamine. The study of the amination network in E. coli provides fundamental knowledge on the plasticity of ammonium metabolism and addresses industrial interests by providing a versatile bacterial chassis for screening and optimization of ammonium assimilation and transamination reactions.
Coral reefs, vital ecosystems sustained by symbiotic relationships between corals and marine algae, rely on the transfer of atmospheric carbon fixed by algae to hosts. This process is crucial for the growth and productivity of coral reefs. Although symbiotic algae, primarily from the family Symbiodiniaceae, are known to provide photosynthates to their hosts, the molecular details of this transfer are largely unknown. A recent study focusing on Breviolum sp., a member of Symbiodiniaceae, has revealed important insights into the mechanism of carbon release from the algal symbiont to the coral host.The research shows that decreases in pH directly accelerate the release of monosaccharides, specifically glucose and galactose, from Breviolum sp. cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates. This release is linked to the degradation of the algal cell wall, as indicated by the deformation of cell surface structures and the upregulation of cellulase-related genes. Importantly, the addition of a cellulase inhibitor suppresses the release of monosaccharides, supporting the hypothesis that low pH signals the cellulase-mediated release of carbon from the algal cell wall as an environmental response in coral reef ecosystems.These findings propose a new perspective on the transfer of photosynthetically fixed carbon from symbiotic algae to host cnidarians, suggesting that stored carbon can be released from the algal cell wall as an environmental response. The low pH-associated secretion is suppressed by inhibition of cellulase, implying that algal symbionts release monosaccharides into the symbiosome within host cnidarian cells by cell wall degradation. This multi-pathway hypothesis, along with the current accepted model, offers a more comprehensive understanding of energy transfer in coral reef ecosystems and has wider implications for understanding energy distribution within the entire coral reef ecosystem.
Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a ciliopathy characterized by renal fibrosis and cyst formation, accounting for a significant portion of end-stage renal disease in children and young adults. INVS/NPHP2 is one of the over 25 NPHP genes identified to date, and its global knockout in mice leads to renal fibrosis and cysts. However, the specific contributions of different cell types and the relationship between epithelial cysts and interstitial fibrosis are not well understood. In a study, cell-type-specific knockout mouse models of Invs were generated and characterized. Epithelial-specific knockout of Invs resulted in renal cyst formation and severe stromal fibrosis, while stromal cell-specific knockout of Invs displayed no observable phenotypes up to the young adult stage. Increased cell proliferation and myofibroblast activation occurred early during disease progression and preceded detectable cyst formation. Concomitant removal of cilia partially suppressed the phenotypes of the Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre mutant kidney, suggesting a significant interaction of cilia and Invs function in vivo. The histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) reduced cyst burden, decreased cell proliferation, and ameliorated kidney function decline in Invs mutant mice, suggesting the possibility of repurposing VPA for NPHP treatment. Primary cilia are widely distributed cell surface organelles that function as signaling hubs for almost all vertebrate cell types. Ciliary dysfunction is associated with an array of human disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies, that include obesity, mental retardation, retinal degeneration, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD), among many others. In renal epithelial cells, cilia protrude into the lumen of tubules, exposed to both mechanical and chemical signals carried by extracellular fluid flow. Disruption of cilia biogenesis almost inevitably leads to the formation of epithelium-lined fluid-filled kidney cysts in mouse. Polycystin 1 and 2, encoded by the autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) genes Pkd1 and Pkd2, respectively, are targeted to cilia, and their specific trafficking highly correlates with their in vivo function. Although both cilia biogenesis and polycystin mutants develop cystic kidney, concomitant removal of cilia ameliorates cyst progression triggered by polycystin inactivation, demonstrating that intact cilia are required for cyst growth in ADPKD models. It is postulated that polycystins function to inhibit a novel and uncharacterized cilia-dependent cyst-activating (CDCA) signaling pathway. This hypothesis implies the existence of a separate cyst-inhibiting (CDCI) pathway mediated by cilia, inactivation of which, together with CDCA, underlies the milder renal cyst formation in cilia biogenesis mutants compared to polycystin mutants. Renal fibrosis is also frequently observed in cystic kidney diseases; but is often considered as secondary to cyst formation and the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a recessive renal cystic disease with cysts mostly confined in the corticomedullary junction region in the juvenile form of the disease, and more widely distributed across the kidney in the infantile form. NPHP is considered as a ciliopathy, and a prominent feature of NPHP is the severity of interstitial fibrosis. Genetically, NPHP is highly heterogeneous and at least 25 genes have been identified for the classic form of this disease. However, mouse mutants of NPHP genes do not always show obvious renal phenotypes. Invs, the homolog of which is associated with both infantile and juvenile NPHP in human, was discovered as a novel gene inactivated in a mouse mutant with reversed internal organ asymmetry along the left-right body axis and was originally named as Inversin (Invs). This whole-body knockout model additionally displays kidney cysts in both the medulla and cortex and renal fibrosis at the neonatal stage, resembling the renal phenotypes of infantile NPHP. However, the functional significance of Invs in different renal cell types is undefined. Therefore, to dissect tissue-specific function of Invs and the mechanism of interstitial fibrosis resulting from defective Invs, two conditional mouse knockout models were generated, targeting Invs deletion in epithelial cells of the distal nephron and deleting Invs in stromal cells. The study found that the infantile NPHP-like phenotypes in mutant kidneys arise from abnormal signaling specifically within and from renal epithelial cells. The fibrotic response and abnormal increase of cell proliferation precede and therefore could initiate independently of cyst formation in this model. Removal of cilia reduces the severity of Invs phenotypes, suggesting that INVS inhibits a cilia-dependent cyst and fibrosis activating pathway. The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) valproic acid (VPA) reduces cell proliferation, suppresses cyst expansion, and preserves kidney function in Invs mutant mice, suggesting VPA, and perhaps other HDACIs, as a potential candidate drug for treating NPHP.
The extinct Steller's sea cow, a whale-sized marine mammal that lived in the North Pacific, had unique morphological specializations that allowed it to thrive in a harsh climate. However, little is known about the physiological adjustments that enabled its evolution in this environment. A recent study analyzed the adult-expressed hemoglobin (Hb) of this sirenian and found a fixed amino acid replacement (β/δ82Lys→Asn) that significantly altered multiple aspects of Hb function. This mutation resulted in a reduced intrinsic temperature sensitivity of Hb-O2 affinity, making O2 delivery to cool peripheral tissues more efficient. It also eliminated the response of Hb to the allosteric effector 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and underlies the secondary evolution of a reduced blood-O2 affinity phenotype that would have promoted heightened tissue and maternal/fetal O2 delivery. The β/δ82Lys→Asn replacement also increased Hb solubility, potentially elevating red blood cell Hb content and contributing to meeting the elevated metabolic (thermoregulatory) requirements and fetal growth rates of this species. These findings highlight the importance of Hb function in the evolutionary adaptation of mammals to extreme environments and the complex interplay between genetic mutations and physiological adaptations.
The study describes the use of activated Ras (RasV12) to generate continuous cell lines of various cell types, including muscle, glial, epithelial, neuronal, and hemocyte, in Drosophila melanogaster. The RasV12 expression provides a growth and survival advantage, making it easier to establish cell lines. By using lineage-restricted Gal4 drivers, the researchers were able to produce cell lines with specific cell-type phenotypes. The generated cell lines are a valuable resource for high-throughput and biochemical approaches, as they provide homogeneous cells in large numbers. The cell lines have been thoroughly characterized, and their transcriptional profiles match those of the corresponding cell types as identified by single-cell sequencing and in situ data. The cells and associated data are available from the Drosophila Genomic Resource Center. The use of cell cultures, including Drosophila cell cultures, has been crucial in studying biological processes that are not easily accessible in whole organisms. Advances in mammalian cell cultures, such as 3D/organoid cultures, improved genome editing tools, and better optimized media formulations, have further enhanced the utility of mammalian cell culture systems. Similarly, insect cell lines, including Drosophila cell lines, have helped illuminate many aspects of insect cell biology, including development, immunity, host-pathogen relationships, and biotechnological applications. There are approximately 250 distinct Drosophila cell lines housed by the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center, with a subset of 25 subjected to transcriptome analysis. The results showed that even cell lines derived from the same tissue had distinct transcriptomic profiles.
Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are specialized epithelial cells with multiple motile cilia used for fluid flow. MCCs undergo dramatic centriole amplification to template the cilia, and recent studies have questioned the role of Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) in this process. To address this, researchers created genetically engineered mouse models and found that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results suggest that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events. MCCs utilize two pathways for centriole amplification: a 'centriole pathway' and a 'deuterosomal pathway'. MCC differentiation is defined by distinct stages, including amplification, growth, disengagement, and multiple basal body phases. While PLK4 is the master regulator of centriole biogenesis in cycling cells, recent work suggests distinct requirements for PLK4 in promoting centriole assembly in cycling cells and differentiating mouse MCCs. However, PLK4 levels are upregulated in differentiating mTECs, and it remains plausible that partial inhibition or depletion of PLK4 is not sufficient to prevent centriole amplification in MCCs. In this study, the researchers use genetic approaches to define the requirements of PLK4 protein and kinase activity for centriole amplification in MCCs and investigate the impact of blocking centriole amplification on the differentiation and surface area scaling of MCCs.
In this study, researchers used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic mouse lines to investigate the origin of epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium during tissue repair. The researchers identified a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that develop a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. The researchers confirmed this hypothesis using a lineage tracing strategy and demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme-to-epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialized luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons to endometrial pathologies that involve a fibrotic response, such as Asherman’s syndrome and endometriosis, as well as other mucosal tissues that have a variable response to wounding. Repetitive injury, inflammation, and fibrosis resulting in disordered tissue architecture are major causes of morbidity and mortality due to organ failure. The endometrium exhibits remarkable resilience in its ability to respond to the monthly wound of ‘menstruation’ without fibrosis and with a response that is both rapid and scar-free. Gaps remain in our understanding of the processes that contribute to rapid, fibrosis/scar-free restoration of an intact luminal epithelium. Several different mechanisms have been proposed as contributing to the luminal repair process, including activation of progenitor/stem cells in the stroma and/or epithelium, epithelial cell proliferation/migration, and transformation of stromal cells into epithelial cells through mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition (MET). In this study, the researchers found evidence for epithelial cell migration and proliferation of residual epithelial cells, but no significant proliferation of basal glands. Additionally, they found evidence of stromal cells changing their identity to adopt an epithelial phenotype through MET and contributing to the luminal surface. This finding suggests that MET may be an important mechanism for rapid restoration of the intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. The researchers plan to use single cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing to explore which, if any, of the stromal mesenchymal cell subpopulations contribute to the rapid restoration of the intact luminal epithelial cell layer observed in their mouse model. This study is the first time that inducible-Cre lineage tracing approaches in adult mice have been used to explore MET in a model of menstruation.
The bacterial species Burkholderia thailandensis exhibits genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, facilitated by phase variation mechanisms, to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. A phase variation system in Burkholderia thailandensis has been identified, generating a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous population through RecA-mediated homologous recombination between a pair of IS2-like elements, duplicating a 208.6 kb DNA region containing 157 coding sequences. This system represents a rare example of IS element-mediated evolution, providing a selective advantage under specific growth conditions and expanding the lifestyle repertoire of the species. Microbes commonly exist in complex communities, and diversity within clonal populations through genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity contributes to productivity and resilience. Phenotypic heterogeneity is often facilitated by phase variation, generating phenotypically distinct subpopulations optimized for persistence under changing conditions. This heterogeneity can increase the fitness of a population by contributing to the division of labor or serving as a bet-hedging strategy to increase the odds of population survival. In Burkholderia thailandensis, genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed in various strains, including the bioterrorism agent B. pseudomallei and the cystic fibrosis-associated opportunistic pathogen B. cenocepacia, exhibiting distinct morphologies and virulence-associated phenotypes. Burkholderia thailandensis strain E264 displays distinct phenotypes attributed initially to the activity of the bcpAIOB-encoded contact-dependent inhibition system but subsequently found to occur when a 208.6 kb region on chromosome I is present in two or more copies, referred to as duplication-dependent phenotypes. The BtE264 stock from ATCC is a genotypically heterogeneous population with approximately half of the bacteria containing a single copy of the 208.6 kb region and half containing two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region, demonstrating a correlation between colony morphology and the presence of two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region. The 208.6 kb region is present in directly oriented tandem copies in the chromosome and not extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules, suggesting that amplification and resolution of the 208.6 kb region within a growing population of bacteria is dynamic.
The translation rate and accuracy are influenced by various components, including transfer RNA (tRNA) pools, tRNA modifying enzymes, and rRNA molecules, many of which have redundant functions. The redundancy in these components is believed to evolve under selection due to its impact on growth rate. However, the fitness costs and benefits of redundancy and its organization across components are not well understood. A study manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of Escherichia coli by deleting tRNA genes, tRNA modifying systems, and rRNA operons in various combinations. The results showed that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful but becomes costly under nutrient limitation. This cost of redundant tRNA genes varies as a function of the maximum growth rate attainable in a given nutrient niche. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. These effects are contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing. The study suggests both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components depending on a species’ evolutionary history with feasts and famines.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in the scale of sequencing data, with more genomes of SARS-CoV-2 having been sequenced than any other organism on earth. These sequences can be represented as a phylogenetic tree, which captures the evolutionary history of the virus and allows the identification of transmission events and the emergence of new variants. However, existing web-based tools for exploring phylogenies do not scale to the size of datasets now available for SARS-CoV-2. To address this issue, a new tool called Taxonium has been developed, which uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser for the first time. Taxonium links each node to associated metadata and supports mutation-annotated trees, which are able to capture all known genetic variation in a dataset. It can be run locally in the browser, from a server-based backend, or as a desktop application.The Taxonium web client was built using web technologies involving SVG or Canvas to visualize the tree, but these have performance limitations. To address this, the developers instead use WebGL, a web standard that allows a computer’s GPU to display web graphics, for efficient visualization of the tree. This approach allows for fast and responsive tree exploration.Taxonium can be used to explore a public tree of over five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and it can also be applied to any tree. It is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium.In response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, genomic researchers collaborated rapidly at an unprecedented scale to produce ever-growing genomic datasets. New tools were developed to understand the functional diversity of these samples, including tools for assigning them into lineages proposed by the community and allowing interactive exploration of trends in these data over time.The fundamental representation of a viral epidemic for genomic epidemiology is a phylogenetic tree, which approximates the transmission tree and can allow insights into the direction of migration of viral lineages. When trees are annotated with the mutations that have occurred at each internal node, they capture information about parallel and convergent evolution, which can identify recurrent mutations of concern.The unparalleled size of SARS-CoV-2 datasets has posed challenges for the array of tools that researchers have previously relied upon to manipulate, analyze, and visualize genomic data. In particular, the construction of phylogenetic trees and the visualization of these trees have been major bottlenecks preventing full-scale analyses.There are two broad responses possible to this issue. One is to downsample the sequences analyzed in order to create a smaller dataset with which existing tools are able to work efficiently. This has been an important approach, and has allowed tools like Nextstrain to provide one of the most widely-used and important tools for exploring SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity.The new scale of data available provides an impetus to develop new tools that are able to operate on these large datasets directly without downsampling. Recently the development of UShER has permitted larger trees to be built than ever previously, and a tool called Chronumental has been developed to turn this distance tree into a time tree, by estimating a time associated with each node in the tree.In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in the scale of sequencing data, with more genomes of SARS-CoV-2 having been sequenced than any other organism on earth. These sequences can be represented as a phylogenetic tree, which captures the evolutionary history of the virus and allows the identification of transmission events and the emergence of new variants. However, existing web-based tools for exploring phylogenies do not scale to the size of datasets now available for SARS-CoV-2. To address this issue, new tools like Taxonium, UShER, and Chronumental have been developed to allow the exploration and analysis of large-scale phylogenetic trees.
In a study of RNA localization, researchers used the RNA proximity labeling technique Halo-seq to examine the transcriptome across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells. They found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells, and that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5' UTRs of these mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. These same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells, and the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the 5' UTR of the transcript and reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-1. The researchers also found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells and establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator. Additionally, the study demonstrates that RNA localization mechanisms can cut across cell morphologies. These results have implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression in different cell types and tissues.
The study of aging and its effects on transcriptional noise in cells has been a topic of interest in recent years. Transcriptional noise is defined as the variation in gene expression among cells that are supposed to be identical. It has been associated with aging and a loss of cellular identity, but recent research suggests that these phenomena may not necessarily coincide. There are various methods for quantifying transcriptional noise, but there is a lack of consensus on the definition and computational methods used. A study by Ibáñez-Solé et al. (2022) aimed to systematically measure age-associated transcriptional noise across different tissues and species, using two computational tools, Decibel and Scallop, to analyze publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Decibel is a Python toolkit that implements four main families of methods for measuring increase in transcriptional noise associated with aging, while Scallop measures the membership of each cell to a particular cluster and quantifies loss of cell type identity as 1 − membership. The study found that the performance of Scallop and other distance-to-centroid (DTC) methods in measuring transcriptional noise and detecting noisy cells within cell types varies. Scallop was able to distinguish between transcriptionally stable cells within each cell type cluster from the more noisy cells that lie in between clusters, while DTC methods could not. However, Scallop was found to be robust to changes in cellular composition, dataset size, number of genes, and marker expression. The study also found that the purported age-associated increase in transcriptional noise might be restricted to particular cell types or tissues and that transcriptional dysregulation occurs at the level of gene-to-gene coordination. Despite numerous attempts at measuring transcriptional noise in aged tissues, several challenges remain, including differences in the definition of transcriptional noise, computational methods used, focus on single datasets, and little attention given to the variability of cellular composition in aged organs. Overall, the study highlights the need for a standardized approach to measuring transcriptional noise in aging cells and tissues.
WILD-seq, a method using lentiviral barcoding and single-cell sequencing, is used to study clonal dynamics in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. The study found that tumors grown in mice have different clonal compositions compared to in vitro cultures, and that the tumor microenvironment significantly affects clonal transcriptomes. WILD-seq was used to analyze tumor response to taxane-based chemotherapy and the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. JQ1 treatment caused a decrease in cytotoxic T-cells and down-regulation of interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation genes in tumor cells. Clones showed varied sensitivity to JQ1, with resistant clones showing higher levels of unfolded protein response and mTOR signaling. Docetaxel treatment resulted in an initial reduction in tumor growth followed by relapse, and clones with high expression of E-cadherin regulated genes and low ZEB1 activity were found to be sensitive to taxane-based therapy. These findings demonstrate the ability of WILD-seq to analyze clonal dynamics and drug response in TNBC models.
DMRT1 is a gene that plays a crucial role in sex determination and differentiation in various species of vertebrates, including mammals. Although it is not the testis-determining factor in mammals, where SRY holds that role, DMRT1 is still essential for mammalian testes differentiation. In rabbits, the loss of DMRT1 results in XY gonads failing to engage testicular differentiation and appearing like control ovaries. Additionally, DMRT1 is required for female fertility, as XX DMRT1−/− adult females were sterile. DMRT1 is a member of the DM domain proteins family, which exhibits a zinc finger DNA-binding motif. It has been identified as the testis-determining factor in several non-mammalian vertebrates, such as birds and some fish species. In mammals, DMRT1 has roles in both germ cells and supporting cells in the testis, and Dmrt1−/− males showed spermatogenesis failure with spermatogonia that did not undergo meiosis. However, specific knock-out of Dmrt1 in adult Sertoli cells led to their transdifferentiation into granulosa cells, indicating that DMRT1 is necessary to maintain Sertoli cell identity in adulthood. Mutations in the DMRT1 gene have been identified in patients with 46, XY DSD, suggesting that DMRT1 and SRY may be involved in testicular determination. Overall, DMRT1 is a crucial gene in sex determination and differentiation, and its mutations may be associated with different human pathologies, such as 46, XY DSD, as well as male and female infertility.
Obesity, a global epidemic, is caused by various factors including high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, leading to chronic diseases. A study using Drosophila as a model for HFD-induced obesity found that CTPS, an enzyme crucial for CTP synthesis, regulates body weight and starvation resistance in the fat body. HFD-induced obesity increases CTPS transcription and cytoophidia length in larval adipocytes. Depleting CTPS in the fat body prevented HFD-induced obesity, including body weight gain, adipocyte expansion, and lipid accumulation, by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis. This establishes a functional link between CTPS and lipid homeostasis, highlighting the potential role of CTPS manipulation in HFD-induced obesity treatment.
During vertebrate embryogenesis, germ layers are patterned by Nodal signals, a process that is conserved across species. While it is known that Nodals signal through a receptor complex consisting of Type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors, the specific receptors that mediate Nodal signaling in zebrafish and the impact of receptor binding on Nodal distribution in the embryo are unclear. In this study, the authors characterize three Type I (Acvr1) and four Type II (Acvr2) homologs in zebrafish and find that, except for Acvr1c, all receptor-encoding transcripts are maternally deposited and present during zebrafish embryogenesis. They generate mutants and use combinatorial morpholino knockdown and CRISPR F0 knockout approaches to assess compound loss-of-function phenotypes and discover that the Acvr2 homologs function partly redundantly and partially independently of Nodal to pattern the early zebrafish embryo, whereas the Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b redundantly act as major mediators of Nodal signaling. Additionally, they find that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways and the role of Nodal signaling in vertebrate development.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) mediated responses are crucial for host defense against viral infections, and their tight control is essential for preventing various diseases. Over the past decades, it has become apparent that multilayered stochasticity drives cellular heterogeneity and subsequent cellular decision-making during IFN-I responses. The initiation of IFN-I production is limited to fractions of 1-3% of the total population, both in vitro, in vivo, and across cell types, which are thought to be stochastically regulated. However, recent studies have challenged this dogma by addressing the influence of various stochastic and deterministic host-intrinsic factors on dictating early IFN-I responses using a murine fibroblast reporter model. Epigenetic drugs, transient heritability, and cell density have been found to play important roles in dictating responder fates during early IFN-I responses, suggesting that cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses is regulated by both stochastic and deterministic factors. These findings open up new avenues for understanding cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses and other (immune) signaling systems.
Microtubules (MTs) are important cytoskeletal components consisting of α/β-tubulin dimers, used as tracks for motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein to transport various cargos, including mRNAs, proteins, and organelles. Tubulins are subjected to several post-translational modifications (PTMs), with glutamylation being one of them. Glutamylation adds one or more glutamic acid residues as branched peptide chains to the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin. In Drosophila ovaries, glutamylation of α-tubulin isotypes occurs on the C-terminal ends of αTub84B and αTub84D but not on αTub67C. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian αTub84B/D, and the normal distribution of kinesin-1 in the germline relies on TTLL5. The precise localization of Staufen and fast, bidirectional ooplasmic streaming depend on TTLL5, suggesting a causative pathway. A mutation of TTLL5 that inactivates its enzymatic activity decreases the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria. These results demonstrate the in vivo roles of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of α-tubulins and the in vivo importance of α-tubulin glutamylation for cellular functions involving microtubule transport.
The development of multiple chromosome-scale reference genome sequences in various taxonomic groups has provided a high-resolution view of the patterns and processes of molecular evolution. However, leveraging information across multiple genomes remains a challenge in eukaryotic systems, with issues ranging from studying chromosome structure evolution to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci to testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. To address these challenges, GENESPACE integrates conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. This approach is demonstrated to be effective in dissecting presence-absence, copy-number, and structural variation at various levels of biological organization. GENESPACE's methods for building and visualizing syntenic orthology offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, particularly in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes. The integration of conserved gene order and orthology helps improve the ability to classify paralogous and orthologous relationships beyond either approach in isolation, providing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of evolutionary relationships among DNA sequences.
In polymicrobial communities, bacteria produce unique compounds and increase virulence and antibiotic resistance. A problematic community is Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which co-colonize burns, cystic fibrosis individuals, and chronic infection sites, leading to worse healthcare outcomes. In vitro, P. aeruginosa drives S. aureus toward extinction, but in vivo, both species can co-exist due to altered gene expression or mutations. However, the growth environment can also influence co-existence. A study combined mathematical modeling and experimentation, finding that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. Specifically, altering the carbon source in growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, and the species with higher absolute growth will increasingly dominate the co-culture. This relationship can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. Therefore, differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature and offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations.
The increase in data generation and publication in biology has led to a need for better knowledge capture about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions between different species. To improve access to this knowledge, a framework for curating the scientific literature studying interspecies interactions has been constructed, using data curated for the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base) as a case study. The framework provides a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen–host interaction data at various levels. The concept of a multispecies genotype, the ‘metagenotype,’ is introduced to facilitate capturing changes in the disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility due to gene alterations. PHI-Canto, a community curation tool for use by publication authors, has also been reported. Recent technological advancements have resulted in an increasing volume of peer-reviewed publications reporting experimental data and conclusions. To increase the value of this highly fragmented knowledge, biocurators manually extract the data from publications and represent it in a standardized and interconnected way following the FAIR Data Principles. Curated functional data is then made available in online databases, either organism- or clade-specific or those supporting multiple kingdoms of life. Manual biocuration is currently the most reliable way to capture information about function and phenotype in databases and knowledge bases. However, for pathogen–host interactions, the original publications do not provide details of specific strains, variants, and their associated genotypes and phenotypes, nor the relative impact on pathogenicity and virulence, in a standardized machine-readable format. The development of curation tools with clear workflows supporting the use of biological ontologies and controlled vocabularies has standardized curation efforts, reduced ambiguity in annotation, and improved the maintenance of the curated corpus as biological knowledge evolves.
The passage discusses the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers and its impact on phenotypic variation within human populations. A study using F1-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. The central region of enhancers is most likely to have genetic variants that alter TF binding and enhancer activity. The AP-1 family of TFs is frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function. These findings provide insight into how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales. Genome sequencing efforts have uncovered large numbers of sequence variants associated with phenotypic variation in complex traits in human populations. A significant proportion of these genetic variants occur within the predicted cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the human genome. Pinpointing the specific sequence changes in CREs that impact expression of linked genes and downstream molecular and cellular phenotypes remains a critical challenge. Despite the stereotyped chromatin features that can be measured genome-wide, these data have not proven to be sufficient to generate quantitative, predictive models for TF binding and enhancer function from available databases of enhancer sequences. Sequence variants that disrupt TF binding can be highly informative for identifying sequences critical for the control of enhancer function in specific cell types. The extensive genetic variation present among inbred mouse strains can be used to conduct ‘mutagenesis screens’ of enhancer sequences in their native chromatin context, directly comparing the activity of two alleles of each enhancer locus within the same cellular environment. This method could have a transformative effect on the ability to identify functional sequence variants in CREs in human genomes.
Viruses interact with host cells at nearly every stage of their replication cycle, and these interactions can either benefit the host or the virus, driving adaptations that leave signatures of pathogen-driven evolution in host genomes. By analyzing these genetic signatures, researchers identified the dynein activating adaptor NINL as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and as a target of viral antagonism. NINL has evolved under recurrent positive selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region, and NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon and increased permissiveness to viral replication. Proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. These findings highlight the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the potential of using signatures of host-virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism. Overall, the study underscores the importance of understanding host-virus conflicts in the evolution of intracellular transport machinery and their implications for viral replication and the immune response.
The structures of four actin isoforms - skeletal muscle α-actin, cardiac muscle α-actin, ß-actin, and γ-actin, have been determined at high resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. These structures reveal isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus that shift closer to the filament surface upon myosin binding, thereby establishing isoform-specific interfaces. Actin isoforms are structurally conserved but have subtle differences that determine their interaction with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins. Understanding the relationship between the structure of actin isoforms and their function is crucial for our understanding of normal cytoskeletal physiology. These structures contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms, and complement the repertoire of known actin structures.
The article discusses a new method called TARDIS (Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences) for high-throughput transgenesis in multicellular systems, which overcomes the limitations of current methods. TARDIS splits the transgenesis process into two steps: first, the creation of individuals carrying experimentally introduced sequence libraries, and second, the inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components from the larger library cassette into engineered genomic sites. This method increases transformation yields up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods. The authors demonstrate the utility of this system using engineered, split selectable TARDIS sites in Caenorhabditis elegans to generate a large set of individually barcoded lineages and transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries. This approach has the potential to expand the impact of exploratory transgenesis in functional domains, such as inter-tissue signaling, neuronal health, and animal behavior, that are dependent on multicellular interactions and therefore difficult to replicate in single-cell models.
The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, undergo a complex journey from the cytosol to their final destinations in the outer membrane. This process involves multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes that facilitate translocation and assembly. Using the deep learning pipeline AF2Complex, researchers have identified and predicted the structures of several protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the E. coli cell envelope, including those involved in the OMP biogenesis pathway. These structures, which are typically of high confidence, explain experimental observations and provide mechanistic hypotheses for how chaperones assist and quality control nascent OMPs. This work highlights the potential of using structural insights from deep learning-based predictions to investigate biological pathways.Gram-negative bacteria are characterized by the presence of an outer membrane (OM) composed of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in an asymmetric bilayer, with embedded lipoproteins and transmembrane β-barrel proteins. These OMPs play vital functional roles, such as exchanging small molecules with the environment through transmembrane β-barrel porins. OMPs are synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes, translocated across the inner membrane, and delivered to the OM via the OMP biogenesis pathway. This process involves various proteins, including essential and auxiliary ones that form multiple complexes in cooperation.The SecYEG translocon and the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) are two core complexes involved in the OMP biogenesis pathway. SecYEG, a hetero-trimer composed of the secretion channel SecY and two additional subunits SecE and SecG, is responsible for moving most cell envelope proteins across the IM. Periplasmic and OM proteins enter the channel in SecY via the SecA-dependent translocation pathway. The signal peptide is then cleaved by a type I signal peptidase (SPase I) to release the substrate from the IM. An OMP, escorted by the chaperones SurA or Skp, continues its journey toward BAM harbored in the OM. BAM, consisting of five subunits, plays a major role in folding a β-barrel and releasing the matured product. Despite significant progress in understanding the OMP biogenesis pathway, many open questions remain, including the identities and atomic structures of supercomplexes and the mechanisms by which chaperones handle and deliver substrates to BAM.Recent deep learning approaches, such as AF2Complex built on AlphaFold2, have made tremendous progress in predicting the structures of protein complexes. Using AF2Complex, researchers have implemented a workflow to search for interacting proteins within the E. coli cell envelope (envelopome) and predict the structures of these PPIs. This strategy allows for the identification of both expected and unexpected interactions, providing structural insights and mechanistic hypotheses for the OMP biogenesis pathway.
Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons regulate basal ganglia functions with a complex axonal domain, having both synaptic and non-synaptic release sites. Neuroligins (NLs), cell adhesion molecules, regulate DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission, but the role of their major interaction partners, neurexins (Nrxns), is unexplored. This study investigates the hypothesis that Nrxns regulate DA neuron neurotransmission. Mice with conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::NrxnsKO) exhibited normal basic motor functions but showed an impaired locomotor response to amphetamine. Decreased levels of the membrane DA transporter (DAT) and increased levels of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) were detected in the striatum of DAT::NrxnsKO mice, along with reduced activity-dependent DA release and increased GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum. Nrxns act as regulators of the functional connectivity of DA neurons, playing a key role in regulating the connectivity and functions of DA neurons. Nrxn mRNA is found in mesencephalic DA neurons, with Nrxn1 at higher levels in VTA neurons, Nrxn2 similarly expressed in both populations, and Nrxn3 at higher levels in SNc neurons. Selectively deleting Nrxn 1, 2, and 3 from DA neurons showed that deletion of Nrxn123 from DA neurons does not lead to major motor coordination and motor learning deficits, but the loss of Nrxns in DA neurons leads to some alteration of the functionality of the DA system and some DA-dependent behaviors.
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions in Africa require mobile phone ownership, and studies are investigating mHealth's effectiveness. This analysis uses data from 44,224 individuals in 33 African countries to estimate mobile phone ownership and identify disparities. 82% of individuals in these countries own mobile phones, with 42% owning basic mobile phones (BPs) and 40% owning smartphones (SPs). Individuals living close to a health clinic have higher odds of ownership than those who do not. Men have over twice the odds of ownership compared to women, and urban residents have almost three times the odds of ownership compared to rural residents. Among mobile phone owners, urban residents have nearly three times the odds of owning an SP compared to rural residents. Ownership increases with age, peaks in 26-40 year olds, then decreases. Individuals under 30 are more likely to own an SP than a BP, while older individuals are more likely to own a BP than an SP. The probability of ownership decreases with the Lived Poverty Index, but some of the poorest individuals own SPs. These findings suggest that if digital devices needed for mHealth interventions are not equally available within the population, rolling out mHealth interventions in Africa is likely to propagate already existing inequities in access to healthcare.
The study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in 9361 individuals from two UK population-based longitudinal studies, TwinsUK and ALSPAC, at two timepoints in April-May 2021 (Q2) and in TwinsUK only in November 2021-January 2022 (Q4). The study aimed to assess the relationship between anti-Spike antibody levels and post-vaccination infection, and investigate associations with an outcome of having relatively low antibody levels following first, second, or third vaccination for multiple socio-demographic, physical and mental health characteristics, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vaccination history. The study found that response rates were high, and participants were predominantly female and of white ethnicity. Participants who had received more vaccinations were older, more likely to be on the UK ‘Shielded Patient List’, and had lower self-rated health compared with those with fewer vaccinations. Cross-sectional antibody levels following third vaccination were much greater and more sustained, with less inter-individual variability compared to levels for those with fewer vaccinations. The study concluded that third vaccination increased absolute antibody levels for almost all individuals, reduced relative disparities compared with earlier vaccinations, and supported a policy of triple vaccination for the generation of protective antibodies.
