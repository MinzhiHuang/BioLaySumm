Cell-fate decisions are regulated by intercellular signaling, such as the Notch signaling pathway, and intrinsic mechanisms like epigenetic chromatin modifications. Notch signaling has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions and can either inhibit or promote cellular reprogramming depending on the context. In C. elegans, Notch signaling, specifically the GLP-1/Notch pathway, maintains germline stem cell/progenitor fate. However, a new study has discovered that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming of germ cells into neuronal cells in C. elegans, which is facilitated by the activation of specific genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1. This finding highlights the complex role of Notch signaling in cell-fate decisions and has implications for development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a dangerous pathogen that can cause severe infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. It is a significant concern in clinical settings, contributing to 7.7% of cases in over 4500 hospitals. The innate immune response is crucial in protecting against K. pneumoniae infections, and neutropenic patients are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and bloodstream infections caused by K. pneumoniae. A study using a mouse model of K. pneumoniae lung infection found that the adaptor protein, SKAP2, is required for protection against K. pneumoniae pulmonary infections. Skap2-/- mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice, and this burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells. SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection. The NADPH oxidase complex plays a critical role in host protection against K. pneumoniae, and receptor-mediated ROS production in neutrophils is driven by signal-transduction pathways that activate components of the NADPH oxidase complex. Signaling through integrin, mincle receptors, G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs), and toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical for protection against K. pneumoniae infection. SKAP2 is a cytosolic adaptor protein required for integrin-mediated ROS production, adhesion, and migration to sterile inflammatory sites through its interaction with mediators of actin rearrangement. SKAP2 is also a target for inactivation by bacterial virulence factors, suggesting that it plays a key role in host defenses against infections. In humans, the Skap2 gene has been identified as a risk locus for Type 1 Diabetes and Crohn’s disease.
The paper discusses the development of a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax, a malaria-causing parasite, and validates it against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. The model demonstrates the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites and some having intensely infected livers. The model is then integrated into a P. vivax transmission model to show the impact of hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine on P. vivax transmission. The model predicts that incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs into first-line treatment regimens will cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission by targeting individuals with the most hypnozoites.Historically, the theoretical foundation of vector-borne diseases such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been based on the Ross-Macdonald models. However, these models are not applicable to P. vivax as they fail to account for the reservoir of dormant liver stages (hypnozoites). Existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver, but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P. vivax transmission models. The paper advances on existing work by considering how the number of hypnozoites in the liver contributes to patterns of relapse infections and the epidemiology and control of P. vivax.In conclusion, the paper presents a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes of P. vivax and integrates it into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P. vivax malaria. The model provides qualitative insights into the relative contribution of relapses to P. vivax transmission and illustrates the consequences for controlling P. vivax with vector control and anti-malarial drugs. The findings of this study have important implications for the understanding and control of P. vivax malaria.
Selective logging in Amazonian forests, which affects 2 million hectares annually, results in 90 Tg C emissions, but these are counterbalanced by forest regrowth. An original modeling approach was used to link regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to predict post-logging C recovery across Amazonia. The study found that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and west (21 ± 3 Mg C ha-1) than in the south (12 ± 3 Mg C ha-1) and highlights the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth. The study also elaborated a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia. This is crucial as global attention is increasingly drawn to the impacts of human activities on carbon cycles due to the 2.1 ± 1.1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests.
Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian forebrain reside in two regions, the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ). These NSCs are quiescent, long-lived, resistant to anti-mitotic agents, and capable of regenerating the SVZ after injury. However, it remains uncertain whether colonies formed in vitro are generated by qNSCs or by mitotically active and shorter-lived multipotent progenitors. A study by Alvarez-Buylla and colleagues has identified a lineage of NSCs and transit amplifying cells in the SVZ that gives rise to neuronal progenitors throughout life. However, the inability to purify live cells from each stage of this hierarchy has hampered efforts to assess their properties. A study by Gotz et al. has identified and isolated by flow cytometry adult mouse lateral ventricle SVZ neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− (GEPCOT) cells. These GEPCOT cells were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo, while pre-GEPCOT cells, which were quiescent, expressed higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexinB2, survived and repopulated the SVZ after temozolomide treatment. The data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo.
Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. The structure of Piezo1, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy, is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint, suggesting that Piezo1 ion channels may interact functionally. However, studies using cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation show that Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension, suggesting that Piezo channels behave independently at densities likely to be physiologically relevant. This property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane. Piezo1 is a mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension with high sensitivity and theoretically may change its channel open probability upon any mechanical disturbance of the cell membrane. However, the propagation of membrane tension away from its source is relatively slow, and the spatial distribution and functional independence of force-gated ion channels play a crucial role in efficiently and rapidly transducing only mechanical forces that are close to the channels. Recent experimental evidence suggests that Piezo1 channels may be non-uniformly distributed, and theoretical calculations suggest that Piezo1 can sense and curve the proximal membrane with a characteristic decay length extending beyond the channel. Piezo1 channels that are within a certain distance of each other may influence each other's gating properties, and imaging of vesicles containing reconstituted Piezo1 has demonstrated the ability of Piezo1 to curve the membrane locally. Overall, studies show that Piezo1 ion channels function independently at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, enabling cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane.
The text discusses decision-making and the role of noisy evidence accumulation in shaping decisions. A key idea is that decisions can be understood using a bounded evidence accumulation model, where evidence is integrated over time until it reaches a threshold or bound, determining both the choice and decision time. Confidence in the decision is thought to come from a mapping between the decision variable (DV) and the probability that a decision based on this DV will be correct. The text also discusses how this model can be tested by manipulating the noise in the momentary evidence. If the bounded accumulation of noisy evidence underlies choice accuracy, reaction time (RT), and confidence, then a selective manipulation of the noise should produce consistent effects on all three measures. Specifically, increased noise should lead to lower accuracy when the expectation of the momentary evidence is strong, faster reaction times when the momentary evidence is weak, and increased confidence when the momentary evidence is weak. These predictions have not been thoroughly tested due to the lack of a controlled method for selectively increasing noise while leaving the expectation unchanged. However, recent research has used techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cortical microstimulation (µStim) to investigate these effects. The text also introduces a novel motion information manipulation in a random dot motion (RDM) display, which increases the volatility of the motion information without affecting its mean, to test the influence of noise on choice behavior in monkeys and humans. Overall, the text highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between noisy evidence accumulation and decision-making.
The insulin-like signaling pathway maintains a short lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors of mammalian cells. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase, also limits the lifespan of C. elegans, and it has been shown that it regulates lifespan through DAF-16. UNC-43, the C. elegans Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) ortholog, phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization. UNC-43-mediated phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. This regulatory mechanism has a different mode of action from the canonical IIS pathway because the phosphorylation activates, rather than represses, DAF-16. Activation of DAF-16 by UNC-43 occurs in response to different types of stress signals, such as heat, starvation, and oxidation. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 can regulate DAF-16 independently of IIS, and the two signaling mechanisms appear to crosstalk, leading to coordinated action on DAF-16. A genetic analysis has shown that a daf-16 (null) allele partially suppresses the longevity of the tax-6 (lf) mutant, suggesting that daf-16 is either a direct or indirect downstream target of C. elegans Calcineurin or acts independently. Further studies have shown that Calcineurin might directly regulate DAF-16 in C. elegans by forming a complex with it and negatively regulating DAF-16 nuclear localization. DAF-16 translocates to the nucleus in long-lived IIS mutants and tax-6 (ok2065) background, but this translocation is dependent on a kinase that initiates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of DAF-16. UNC-43, the only Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase in C. elegans, is one such kinase that represses str-2 expression. However, UNC-43 does not activate DAF-16 through the NSY-1/SEK-1 MAP kinase pathway. UNC-43 directly binds and phosphorylates DAF-16 in vitro and in vivo. An in vitro kinase assay has shown that GST-UNC-43 readily phosphorylates DAF-16 in vitro, specifically at T240 and S286 residues. These phosphorylation events occur at the predicted CAMKII sites (RXXS/T or S/TXD) and increase DAF-16 activity, promoting its nuclear localization and affecting lifespan regulation.
In this study, researchers used genetically modified fruit flies to determine how motor sequences are formed for the specific behavior of grooming different body parts. They found that grooming motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy, where the motor program that occurs first suppresses those that occur later. Once one body part is cleaned, the sensory drive to its motor program is reduced, which releases suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress. This is the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevalent model for generating human action sequences. This finding has implications for understanding how complex behaviors in animals are controlled and coordinated.
In mammalian oocytes, Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) plays multiple roles in the complex process of meiotic chromosome segregation. Sgol2 is known to protect cohesin and silence the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), but recent studies have shown that it also plays a crucial role in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitating the formation of kinetochore-microtubules (K-fibers), and limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin and silence the SAC is dependent on its interaction with PP2A and Mad2, respectively. However, its effects on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation are independent of PP2A and are mediated by the recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively. These interactions enable Sgol2 to coordinate many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation. Defects during meiotic chromosome segregation can lead to the formation of aneuploid eggs, which is a major cause of fetal miscarriages. Understanding the causes of meiotic chromosome missegregation requires clarifying not only the forces and regulatory mechanisms governing meiotic chromosome segregation but also how these are coordinated. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a crucial regulatory mechanism that ensures the proper attachment of chromosomes to the spindle before anaphase. Sgol2 helps turn off the SAC by binding directly to both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2, moderating chromosome stretching by recruiting the kinesin MCAK, and promoting the formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B/C kinase specifically at kinetochores. Through its multi-domain structure, Sgol2 has an important if not unique role in coordinating many of the key processes within this array, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information to the next generation.
In the study of synapse formation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity, the persistent changes in brain connectivity require RNA localization and protein synthesis. Previous studies have shown that local translation promotes the alteration of synapse structure and function during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. This study investigated if local stimulation triggers directed trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses. The results showed that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. The mechanisms that trigger local translation involve calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Regulating local translation rather than directing the delivery of mRNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues. This study provides new insights into the spatial regulation of gene expression during synapse formation and plasticity, and the role of RNA localization and protein synthesis in these processes.
The study discussed here focuses on the use of an inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to investigate the effects of mosaic knockdown (KD) of ROCK1 and CDH1, which regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension. The results showed that mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 results in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while maintaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. This system allows for the temporal regulation of knockdowns with limited off-target effects and can induce well-defined genetic perturbation at explicit times and within defined populations of cells, enabling the study of developmental symmetry-breaking events. The findings suggest that this approach can be useful for understanding the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis and advancing tissue modeling and organ developmental studies.
The article proposes a normative theory for set size effects in visual working memory (VWM), where the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. The model predicts set size effects, which are mediated by probing probability, and accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability in nine delayed-estimation experiments. The model also supports the possibility that cognitive limitations arise from rational cost minimization rather than constraints. The authors apply the model to the delayed-estimation task, expressing the expected local behavioral cost as an expected value of the behavioral cost with respect to the error distribution. They assume a one-parameter power-law function for the behavioral cost, and find a set size effect that is qualitatively similar to empirical results. The predictions of the model align with empirical findings, such as the study by Palmer et al. (1993) and Emrich et al. (2017), which suggest that relevant set size acts virtually identically to actual set size and probing probability is a better predictor of performance than set size. The model accounts well for subject-level error distributions and two statistics that summarize these distributions, and provides a principled explanation of set size effects without sacrificing quality of fit compared to one of the best available descriptive models of VWM.
The plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which causes potato blight and is a major threat to food security, uses an effector protein called PexRD54 to interfere with the plant's autophagy processes. Autophagy is a conserved catabolic pathway that plays a vital role in the survival of an organism by improving cellular adaptation to environmental and stress conditions. PexRD54 binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL, stimulating autophagosome formation and depleting the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes, counteracting host defenses. This is an example of a plant pathogen effector evolving to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses. The molecular mechanisms of selective autophagy and the components that regulate it are still not fully understood, and further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of autophagy in plant-pathogen interactions.
A study using a multistimulus microdevice to analyze human primary cardiac fibroblast (CF) behavior found that the combination of hypoxia and a simulated loss of contractility (2% strain) is able to induce increased CF release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. This research provides a first analysis of human CF behavior under combined application of cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension, elucidating differential CF responses to different combinations of stimuli. The findings suggest that the onset of pathological myocardial conditions causes alterations of specific environmental cues at the cellular scale, including mechanical strain, oxygen and nutrient levels, and levels of inflammatory cytokines. A comprehensive model of how early environmental changes may induce CF pathological responses is still not fully understood, in part due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation. Previous research has shown that individual stimuli such as mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines can affect CF behavior, but this study highlights the importance of understanding how environmental stimuli interplay and guide cellular responses in the context of cardiac injury and CF adaptive responses.
In Drosophila, the DOMINO chromatin regulator complex plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by combining histone acetylation and nucleosome remodeling activities, specifically for the H2A.Z variant (H2A.V in flies). Alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, form two distinct multi-subunit complexes, DOM-A.C and DOM-B.C, that are necessary for transcriptional regulation through different mechanisms. The DOM-B.C complex deposits H2A.V genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A.C complex, on the other hand, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Drosophila uses alternative splicing to generate functional diversity among chromatin regulators, similar to how yeast and humans achieve diversity through gene duplication and paralog specification.Nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, are organized in polymeric fibers and have dynamic properties that enable gene regulation through ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors, chemical modifications of histones, and histone variants. H2A.Z is a highly conserved variant found in active promoters and enhancers, and is associated with transcription initiation and early elongation. In Drosophila, H2A.Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex, which is conserved across species, including humans.In Drosophila, the domino gene encodes for the SWR1 ortholog, giving rise to two major isoforms, DOM-A and DOM-B, through alternative splicing. These isoforms play non-redundant, essential roles during development with interesting phenotypic differences. The DOM-B.C complex is the main ATP-dependent remodeler for H2A.V, responsible for its deposition across the genome and specifically at active promoters. Surprisingly, the DOM-A.C complex is not involved in bulk H2A.V incorporation, but acts as the 'missing' acetyltransferase NuA4.C of Drosophila, specifically targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, the most abundant and yet uncharacterized H4 acetylation in flies. Moreover, the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A.C, and this principle might be conserved across metazoans.In summary, the DOMINO chromatin regulator complex in Drosophila utilizes alternative splicing to generate functional diversity among chromatin regulators, employing distinct complexes for histone acetylation and histone variant exchange. The DOM-B.C and DOM-A.C complexes, specified by alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase (DOM-A and DOM-B), carry out these functions through different mechanisms, ultimately regulating transcription and maintaining chromatin dynamics.
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a cholinergic synapse that enables rapid communication between motor neurons and muscle cells for muscle contraction. Its formation involves reciprocal interactions between nerve terminals and muscle cells, with nerve-derived agrin directing post-synaptic differentiation. However, less is known about retrograde mechanisms that control motor neuron survival and presynaptic differentiation. Wnt signaling has been implicated in NMJ formation, with β-Catenin (Ctnnb1) in muscle cells being necessary for presynaptic differentiation. A study using transgenic mice found that the transcription activity of muscle Ctnnb1, not its adhesion function, is required for presynaptic differentiation. The muscle Ctnnb1 may regulate presynaptic differentiation via cell adhesion-dependent signaling and/or gene-expression. The study also identified Slit2, a repulsive axon guidance cue, as a novel retrograde factor in NMJ formation. Expression of Slit2 specifically in muscle fibers was able to rescue NMJ deficits in Ctnnb1-mutant mice. The N-terminal region of Ctnnb1 interacts with α-catenin, and mutation of key amino acid residues in Ctnnb1 for interaction with α-catenin prevents Ctnnb1 from binding to α-catenin but does not alter transcription by Ctnnb1 and TCF/Lef1. Transgenic mice with these mutations in Ctnnb1 were viable and fertile and exhibited normal NMJ morphology. However, expression of Ctnnb1 mutants in skeletal muscles led to NMJ deficits, indicating that the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is not necessary for presynaptic differentiation.
A team of researchers has developed computational and experimental approaches to quantify the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters at both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolutions. They applied these methods to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters and found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell-cell junctions. At the multi-cellular scale, cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. The researchers also found that force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. These findings provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues and highlight the methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions. The researchers used high-resolution traction force microscopy and time-lapse live cell microscopy to quantify cell-cell mechanical interactions in dynamic multi-cellular clusters while maintaining sub-cellular resolution needed to measure force exchange at the level of individual junctions. Their method expanded upon several pioneering studies and provided the time and sub-cellular resolution needed to derive the spatiotemporal coordination of force exchanges in larger cell groups as well as the coupling of force and protein dynamics at individual adherens junctions. The researchers quantitatively mapped the forces transmitted through individual cell-cell junctions of dynamic MCF10A epithelial cell clusters of various sizes and configurations over time. Their results revealed that the spatial distributions and dynamics of basal cell-cell force transmission correlated with morphogenetic events such as cell divisions. Along the cell junction, the local mechanical stresses also correlated with localization of E-cadherin molecules. Expanding their approach to temporal force fluctuation analysis at the length scale of a cell, they found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction. Together these results provide a first glimpse of the dynamics of sub-cellular force exchanges that yield stress homeostasis in quiescent and proliferating tissues.
Huntingtin, the large protein product of the Huntingtin gene, is composed of five distinct domains and has a spherical α-helical solenoid structure with a central cavity, as revealed by circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry. The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin, which causes Huntington’s disease, increases the α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects intramolecular interactions among the domains. The polyglutamine region is not conserved in some huntingtin orthologues, implying a role as an extra feature that fine-tunes huntingtin structure and function. Human huntingtin is phosphorylated at more than seventy modified serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, and a comparison of lines of transgenic modified HTT BAC mice has implicated unique amino-terminal serine phosphorylation in protection against deleterious effects of mutant huntingtin. The amino-terminal polyglutamine segment of huntingtin is accessible at the outside surface and forms a spherically shaped solenoid with an internal cavity, as shown by the detection of the amino-terminus of huntingtin by electron microscopy. The 3D structure of Q23- and Q78-huntingtin-antibody complexes reveals an extra density at the top of the structure, indicating that the extreme N-terminus, and by inference the adjacent polyglutamine tract, is folded back and accessible at the outside surface. The solenoid structure of huntingtin and the presence of a large cavity in its core suggest that huntingtin may function as a mechanical scaffold for multi-member complexes, and the polyglutamine expansion may affect this function by altering intramolecular interactions and folding.
NCOA4 is a selective cargo receptor that plays a critical role in the autophagic turnover of ferritin, which is crucial for regulating intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy flux and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are not well understood. Recent studies have shown that NCOA4 interacts directly with ferritin via a key surface arginine in FTH1 and a C-terminal element in NCOA4, and this interaction is required for the delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes. NCOA4 abundance is regulated by both autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system, with ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover promoted by excess iron. NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation and is regulated by intracellular iron status, with high iron levels leading to low NCOA4 abundance and ferritin accumulation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 interacts with NCOA4 and is involved in NCOA4 ubiquitination and turnover in an iron-dependent manner. Further study of the NCOA4-ferritin interaction and the regulation of NCOA4 abundance by iron and the ubiquitin proteasome system will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of ferritinophagy and the role of NCOA4 in iron homeostasis and erythroid differentiation.
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for higher-level cognition, with different areas of the PFC involved in various cognitive functions. A prominent organizing principle of the lateral PFC (LPFC) is that its rostral-caudal axis is structured according to the level of cognitive control, with progressively rostral areas performing progressively higher levels of cognitive control through processing increasingly abstract representations. This organization allows the LPFC to control behavior across multiple timescales, including adapting actions according to the prevailing context and aligning behaviors with longer-term goals and plans. Recent research suggests that the LPFC is hierarchically organized, with more rostral areas exerting asymmetrically greater influence upon more caudal areas. However, data supporting this hierarchical processing and its surmised cognitive advantages have been limited. A study using human fMRI data found rostral/caudal gradients of abstraction in the LPFC, with the relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioning the mid LPFC as the apex of the hierarchy. Cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards mid LPFC, consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. The strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability. These results suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized with the mid LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior. Understanding the nature of hierarchical processing in the LPFC remains a significant barrier to modeling goal-directed cognition.
The evolution of higher intelligence in humans is associated with cortical expansion and folding, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cortical folding are not well understood. A hominoid-specific gene, TBC1D3, undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution and is required for the generation of outer radial glia (oRG) in mice and humans. Expression of TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice causes delamination of ventricular radial glia cells (vRGs) and promotes the generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of oRGs. Localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 is often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Therefore, TBC1D3 is a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating cortical expansion and folding. Cortical expansion and folding are linked to the increase in intelligence and involve increased production of cortical neurons due to an extended neurogenic period and increased proliferative ability of neural stem cells and progenitors. The emergence of an outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) consisting of a massive pool of proliferating basal progenitors (BPs) and post-mitotic neurons in the primate cortex contributes to cortical expansion and folding. In primates, oRG and intermediate progenitors in the OSVZ can undergo multiple rounds of symmetric or asymmetric divisions, unlike IPs and oRG cells in the mouse SVZ, which usually exhibit final division to generate a pair of post-mitotic neurons. The radial and lateral expansion of BPs is thought to be a main cause of cortical folding of gyrencephalic species. Gene duplication may play critical roles in brain evolution, and multiple primate- and hominid-specific genes are likely to be involved in the emergence of cortical folding. The TBC1D3 gene, derived from a segmental duplication with multiple copies present in the human chromosome 17 and present in the chimpanzee genome as a single copy gene, is implicated in the expansion of intrachromosomal segmental duplications during hominoid evolution.
In the plant immune response, the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a crucial defense mechanism mediated by the transcription coactivator NPR1, which is regulated by a complex system of ubiquitination and deubiquitination. The ubiquitination of NPR1 is a sequential process involving multiple enzymes: initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes, while polyubiquitination by the E4 ligase UBE4 targets it for proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases, fine-tuning NPR1 activity without requiring its sacrificial turnover. NPR1 plays a master role in plant immunity, controlling the transcription of immune-responsive target genes. Its activity is regulated by a combination of redox-based modifications, phosphorylation, and SUMOylation, resulting in the formation of a transactivation complex that initiates the transcription of immune-responsive target genes. Subsequent phosphorylation of NPR1 results in its recruitment of CRL3, followed by degradation, which is necessary for the full expression of its target genes and the removal of inactive NPR1 from target promoters. UBE4, an E4 ligase, plays a crucial role in this process. In Arabidopsis, ubiquitination of NPR1 is controlled by multiple ubiquitin chain modifying enzymes. UBE4 promotes stepwise ubiquitin chain extension, while other enzymes contribute to trimming activities. The conjugated ubiquitin chains of dynamic variable length fine-tune the transcriptional outputs of unstable coactivators. The ube4 mutant exhibits enhanced immune gene expression, and this phenotype is dependent on SA and the transcription coactivator NPR1. UBE4 promotes NPR1 degradation and facilitates the formation of long ubiquitin chains on NPR1, leading to its proteasomal degradation. SA-induced NPR1 accumulates to elevated levels in both cul3a/b and ube4 mutants. In the absence of UBE4-mediated long-chain polyubiquitination, NPR1 remains in a highly active transcriptional state. UBE4 enhances polyubiquitination of NPR1, and it physically binds to polyubiquitinated NPR1 to facilitate ubiquitin chain extension, controlling its stability and promoting transcriptional activity. In ube4 mutants, NPR1 remains transcriptionally active, leading to an increase in SA-induced expression of NPR1 target genes and elevated homeostatic levels of NPR1 protein. Changes in polyubiquitin chain length regulate NPR1 association with its target promoters, and in the absence of long polyubiquitination, early occupancy by transcriptionally competent NPR1 is increased at target promoters. The ligases CRL3 and UBE4 function sequentially in the stepwise addition or extension of ubiquitin chains on NPR1 but with opposing effects on its transcriptional activity. Loss of UBE4 largely uncouples NPR1 target gene expression from proteasome activity, demonstrating the importance of progressive ubiquitination for NPR1 activity.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 nt siRNAs) play a crucial role in guiding cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of siRNAs requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), and DICER-like 3 (DCL3). However, siRNA precursors are largely undefined. A new study has identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) that accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. These P4R2 RNAs share characteristics with Pol IV transcripts, including a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine and occasional non-templated nucleotides at the 3' termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model where siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events. This discovery provides new insights into the biogenesis of siRNAs and their role in RNA-directed DNA methylation in plants.
The development of mature neural networks and their ability to perform complex computations is crucial for cognition, and is believed to be regulated during postnatal development. A study using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice found that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, followed by spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity. A similar developmental trajectory was demonstrated in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. It is hypothesized that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. The first organized and predominant pattern of neural activity that appears in cortical circuits across species is a spindle-like oscillation (10-20 Hz) that occurs intermittently on a background of relative neural inactivity. Known as spindle bursts in rodents and delta brushes in humans, this immature network activity is commonly triggered by peripheral stimuli and is transient, emphasizing their role in network maturation. Mature cortex exhibits perpetual, complex patterns of neural activity that appear and interact across a wide range of frequencies, facilitating information processing and resulting in cognitive processes from stimulus perception to learning and memory. Understanding when and how these properties develop in the immature brain is critical given that delay or failure to express mature brain activity is a strong risk factor for subsequent impaired cognition.
The coexistence of multiple strains in pathogen populations that undergo sexual recombination is a central question in epidemiology with significant implications for control. This is because the population genetic interactions between pathogen strains can have consequences for transmissibility, clinical immunity, and the duration and severity of infection. An agent-based model was developed to extend earlier 'strain theory' by addressing the var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest type of malaria in humans. The var genes of P. falciparum are multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression and are critical to the parasite's ability to evade immune detection. The model tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports this role for immune selection in structuring parasite diversity. These findings have important implications for understanding the population genetics of P. falciparum and the control of malaria.
Shigella flexneri, a bacterial pathogen, secretes the Type III effector OspI that functions as a deamidase and inhibits the host inflammatory Nf-κB signaling. OspI specifically targets a glutamine residue in UBC13, a component of the Ub-conjugating enzyme, and converts it to glutamate. This deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain (TRAF6RING), which is critical for the ubiquitination reactions of TRAF6. The deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC1
The paper by Keller et al. explores the use of bidirectional manipulations, such as activation and inactivation, to understand the functions of specific cortical interneuron types. However, they found that this may not always provide valid and internally consistent insights into interneurons’ computational roles. Through single-unit recordings in auditory cortex of awake mice, they showed that inactivating somatostatin-positive (Sst+) interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. This suggests that these interneurons support specific, separable functions in the auditory cortex. However, activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. A simple network model was used to understand this asymmetry, and showed that seemingly minor experimental details can qualitatively change the readout of a neural population’s role in computation. This study highlights the importance of considering the specific parameters and conditions when interpreting the functions of neural populations.
A study examining the role of oscillatory synchronization during demanding working memory (WM) performance using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) found that entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands improved behavioral WM performance. The study used tACS to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms in the theta range (4-8 Hz), which has been shown to organize local neuronal ensembles across distant regions during WM processes. The results showed that synchronous (in-phase) stimulation caused an improvement in performance and led to increased frontoparietal activity when cognitive demands were high. These findings suggest that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks, and these modulations are detectable using fMRI. The study also highlights the important influence of underlying cognitive demand on the neural effects of tACS.
In contrast to invertebrates and early vertebrates, where embryonic polarity is established by maternal determinants, amniote embryos, such as birds and mammals, retain plasticity until gastrulation. In chick embryos, the earliest known factor specifying polarity is cVg1, a TGFβ signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen for upstream regulators of cVg1 identified Pitx2, a transcription factor essential for axis formation and a direct regulator of cVg1 expression. Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1, and Nodal are also key actors in left-right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.
The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors that are enabled by early olfactory circuits processing temporal variation of olfactory stimuli. To investigate this, flies were subjected to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs) were examined. A temporal transformation was found between OSN and PN spike patterns, with PNs primarily signaling the acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers. This is important because odor distribution in nature is intermittent and dynamic, and animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of odor stimuli. Drosophila larvae are capable of moving toward a droplet of an attractive odor by actively orienting themselves, and adult fruit flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume and staying within a specific odor zone. To enable such odor-guided tasks, it is essential for any olfactory system to process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers. Recent studies have investigated how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems, observing significant temporal processing of odor signals. However, these studies employed a simple odor delivery system that generated step-pulse-like odor stimuli without directly monitoring the actual odor concentration levels. Therefore, a novel odor delivery system was used that can reliably produce various odor concentration waveforms and provide measurements of the odor concentration with a millisecond resolution on every experiment trial. Various odor concentration profiles were designed and tested, and the corresponding OSN and PN responses were measured. The observed odor concentrations were closely matched between the two assays. PNs generally showed a bigger peak spike rate and exhibited more phasic spiking patterns than the presynaptic OSNs. However, the exact functional transformation between OSNs and PNs could not be readily assessed due to the complex dynamics of OSN and PN signals.
In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of male and female gametes, resulting in the formation of an embryo and endosperm, surrounded by the seed coat. The seed coat's development is inhibited by epigenetic regulators, but fertilization triggers its development by removing this block through a signal derived from the fertilization products. AGL62, a MADS-box transcription factor, regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, and its mutants result in seed abortion. Auxin and GA signaling are active in the developing seed coat, and treatments with GA3 or 2,4-D result in 30% to 40% of ovules showing strong or very strong staining, indicating that both hormones have a role in cell growth and expansion. Ectopic expression of GA3ox1 under the control of the BANYULS promoter or increased auxin production in the integuments triggers seed coat development without fertilization. Auxin produced in the endosperm after fertilization is necessary for early stages of seed coat development, but auxin signaling is not required for full seed expansion until later developmental stages. Seeds mutant for auxin biosynthesis show seeds aborting at different sizes, and around 2.5% of seeds completely fail to develop a seed coat. The proliferation of the endosperm is not required for seed coat initiation, and auxin biosynthesis in the central cell is sufficient to trigger seed coat development.
A study conducted by Wagner et al. utilized a high-throughput phage engineering method to examine the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP and its interaction with different hosts. The research, involving 1660 variants, aimed to identify regions of functional importance and adaptation to specific hosts, as well as discover gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts. The engineered T7 variants demonstrated greater virulence and the ability to avert emergence of spontaneous resistance in Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections. The study highlights the potential of ORACLE, a high-throughput precision phage genome engineering technology, in uncovering molecular determinants of activity and host range, and its applicability in investigating sequence-function relationships in phages. The findings contribute to understanding the molecular basis of phages and their potential therapeutic use.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a rare condition characterized by impaired perception and memory for pitch, have been found to downweight pitch cues during speech perception and rely on other dimensions such as duration. An fMRI study examining the neural basis for this strategy found prominent reductions in functional connectivity in the amusia group between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions. These connectivity differences were not present during a control task, indicating a compensatory mechanism in the brains of individuals with amusia. While previous research has focused on impaired connectivity between right inferior frontal cortex and right auditory cortex as the neural basis for amusia, this study provides evidence for a more complex compensation mechanism involving multiple regions of the brain. The results of the study suggest that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, and this compensation mechanism may be specific to the modality and dimensions being processed. Further research is needed to fully understand the neural foundations of perceptual weighting in speech in atypical individuals.
Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2) is a contagious cancer affecting Tasmanian devils, in addition to the already widespread Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1). Both cancers have distinct genetic origins and affect the face, neck, and oral cavity of the host. DFT1 has caused significant mortality and population decline, while DFT2 has been recently identified in the Channel region of Southwest Tasmania. DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules, but the most highly expressed alleles are non-classical or shared with host devils, reducing immunogenicity. Additionally, there is evidence of MHC class I loss in DFT2 tumors, similar to the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. DFT2's ability to pass between individuals without a protective immune response remains unknown, as well as the conditions that allowed for the emergence of two contagious cancers in this species. Overall, contagious cancers in mammals and mollusks may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumor and host, with loss of allogeneic antigens potentially facilitating widespread transmission.
The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) is crucial for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the neural codes underpinning these functions are not well understood. Utilizing optogenetic circuit mapping in mice, a recent study revealed a double dissociation that allows parallel circuits in superficial RSG to process different inputs. Specifically, the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly and selectively recruit small, low-rheobase (LR) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1 enables this parallel processing, and thalamocortical synaptic dynamics allow computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation. These findings suggest parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG. This research contributes to understanding the functional nature of RSG anatomical connections and the subtype-specific responses of RSG neurons, which is critical for developing a mechanistic understanding of how the RSG integrates information from multiple sources to carry out its spatial and non-spatial functions.
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and a prominent risk factor for neurodegeneration and dementia, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms by which physical injury leads to progressive Tau pathology are not well understood, but are thought to involve prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates. A study using zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor found that subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death, suggesting a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI. Further work is needed to determine the potential of anti-convulsants as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy.
The organization of the human brain into large-scale functional networks has been extensively studied using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI). Spontaneous fluctuations in distinct brain regions, as measured with rfMRI, show temporal correlations with each other, revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity (FC). The strength of the functional coupling between two different neural populations and the spatial configuration and organization of functional regions are potential sources of meaningful cross-subject variability in rfMRI data. A study aimed to identify how these key aspects of rfMRI data influence derived measures of FC and how they relate to interesting trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals. The findings revealed variability in the spatial topography of functional regions across subjects, and suggested that this variability is the primary driver of cross-subject trait variability in correlation-based FC measures obtained via group-level rfMRI parcellation approaches. These results have important implications for future rfMRI research and for the interpretation of FC findings. The spatial variability across subjects captured in PFMs is strongly associated with behavior. Network edges, commonly thought to reflect coupling strength between spatially separated neuronal populations, are highly sensitive to spatial misalignments across individuals. Additionally, correlation-based edge estimates are influenced by the amplitudes of localized spontaneous rfMRI fluctuations, which capture trait variability across subjects, and state variability within an individual over time. These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of edge-strength estimates to many different types of subject variability and highlight the need to identify which aspects of FC tap most directly into behaviorally relevant population-level variability.
The identity of components in the transcription pre-initiation complex is proposed to control cell type-specific gene expression, with the TFIID-TBP complex being replaced by TRF3/TBP2 for muscle-gene activation. However, TBP2 null mice show intact muscle regeneration potential, and TBP2 is not expressed in established muscle cells or primary mouse MuSCs. During myoblast differentiation, reduced amounts of TFIID-TBP form a complex on muscle gene promoters, necessary for their expression. TBP2 does not replace TBP; instead, limiting TFIID-TBP amounts promote muscle-specific gene expression. RNA polymerase II recruitment to protein coding genes is typically nucleated by TFIID-mediated recognition of core promoter sequences. TFIID is composed of TBP and TAFs, but TBP-related factors like TBP2 increase the repertoire and versatility of the basal transcription machinery. Cell type-specific gene expression may be determined by changes in PIC components, with TBP2 and TAF3 replacing canonical TFIID during skeletal muscle differentiation. TAF3, recognizing histone H3K4me3, mediates interactions between MyoD, permissive chromatin, and PICs at promoters of muscle-specific genes. However, TBP2 is dispensable for developmental myogenesis, and its role in promoting muscle gene expression in muscle stem cells during adult life remains unclear.
A study examining the impact of brain stimulation on neural circuit dynamics in two macaques found that stimulation significantly strengthens gross functional connectivity between primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex, and leads to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network on a finer scale. These changes align with Hebbian plasticity models, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation. Many neurological and psychiatric disorders are caused by dysfunctional neural dynamics at the network level, stemming from aberrant neural connectivity. Brain stimulation protocols can be designed to leverage the brain's innate plasticity and rewire aberrant neural connectivity, potentially curing these disorders. However, understanding how stimulation-induced plasticity drives changes in network connectivity and dynamics is crucial for implementing such treatments. Despite extensive work studying Hebbian plasticity at the cellular level, it remains unclear how synaptic plasticity leads to large-scale functional reorganization. Recent studies have shown large-scale plasticity following brain stimulation consistent with Hebbian mechanisms. For instance, an activity-dependent stimulation protocol introduced an artificial connection between two sites in the motor cortex, leading to a stable functional change in stimulation-evoked movements, indicating that stimulation induces large-scale plasticity. Similar results have been observed using open-loop stimulation protocols to induce targeted plasticity between two cortical sites. This work measures connectivity across sensorimotor cortex and tracks changes in network connectivity in response to open-loop stimulation, taking advantage of a large-scale optogenetic interface that enables simultaneous stimulation of populations of excitatory neurons while recording large-scale μ-electrocorticography (μ-ECoG) activity across two brain areas, S1 and M1. The study investigates large-scale functional reorganization following stimulation, informing future neurorehabilitation strategies.
In this study, a Rhesus macaque monkey (Monkey S) with probable congenital or perinatal damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) was analyzed using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging to understand the neural consequences of such damage and its impact on human patients. Monkey S displayed typical in-group behavior, but visual task training was impaired. Visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal, and visual stimulation under anaesthesia activated lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar, with sparse visual cortical activation including face patches. An intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation was found, even without V1. However, there was little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT, supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena. The study highlights the potential for functional visual networks to develop or be sustained in the absence of the main visual input to cortex and suggests the presence of potential pathways for visual information to bypass V1 and reach extrastriate visual areas.
The human innate immune system has the ability to recognize foreign double-stranded DNA of pathogenic origin in the intracellular environment, but the molecular mechanisms by which it distinguishes foreign DNA from host genomic material are not well understood. A study by Quies et al. (2016) used biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques to investigate the role of the nuclear innate immune sensor IFI16 in this process. They found that IFI16 uses a scanning-assisted assembly mechanism to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms on foreign DNA, while nucleosomes prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with these one-dimensional movements. The host innate immune system directly recognizes molecular signatures associated with pathogens, such as DNA and RNA, and assembles supramolecular signaling platforms that trigger inflammatory responses on invading foreign DNA. IFI16 is a key innate immune sensor that detects foreign dsDNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms in both the host nucleus and cytoplasm. IFI16 plays a central role in defense against a number of pathogens, but persistent IFI16 signaling is associated with autoimmunity. The molecular mechanisms by which IFI16 selectively targets foreign dsDNA remain unknown, but the authors propose a unifying mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves these central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways.
Spatially Targeted Optical Microproteomics (STOMOP) is a novel, semi-automated proteomic technique used to interrogate micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. This method involves staining the tissue with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, followed by soaking the specimen in solutions containing a photo-tag. Confocal imaging along with two photon excitation is used to covalently couple the photo-tag to all proteins within each ROI. The tagged proteins are then isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. STOMOP can be applied to various biological samples including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue. This method has been shown to confirm known plaque constituents and discover new ones in Alzheimer's disease mouse models and post-mortem cases.Pathological protein deposits have long been used as hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Early methods of identifying these deposits include the silver stain introduced by Golgi in 1873 and Virchow's iodine-sulfuric acid stain for starch in 1854. More specialized stains and labels have emerged to probe the structure and composition of pathological protein deposits. For example, the stains Congo red and thioflavin S specifically identify deposits containing a particular structural motif: amyloid β-pleated sheets. However, merely detecting these deposits is not enough; comprehensive identification of the protein components of these deposits is necessary for a full understanding of the disease mechanisms.Traditional methods of identifying the protein components of these deposits involve partial biochemical purification of detergent-insoluble proteins present in a tissue specimen followed by protein sequencing. Immunohistochemical methods are then used to confirm that the identified proteins are bona fide constituents of the pathological deposits. However, these methods require large amounts of sometimes-scarce pathological tissue and can be costly and time-consuming. For example, the discovery of TDP-43 in ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions required the generation of ~1000 monoclonal antibodies, which were used to screen thousands of tissue sections by immunohistochemistry, to obtain a single monoclonal antibody that specifically labeled ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions.Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is another method used to identify deposit-associated soluble proteins. This method can preserve some of the deposit-associated soluble proteins, but it is limited by the resolution of ~10 µm in the horizontal plane and captures the entire thickness of the tissue section along the vertical axis. Therefore, for features smaller than ~10 µm, LCM analysis permits enrichment but not complete isolation of target proteins.In contrast, STOMOP provides high spatial resolution, targeting any identifiable or user-defined spatial region in a biological sample, and does not require genetic modification. The STOMOP macro provides a semi-automated tool for photo-tagging proteins in pathological deposits without the need for manual tracing of features. This method has been used to identify altered levels of eleven specific proteins in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of brain samples from patients with AD, and to demonstrate that the post-synaptic protein IRSp53 was highly down-regulated in AD. Overall, STOMOP is a powerful tool for advancing research in cell biology and understanding the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.
The disruption of the Frizzled3 (Fz3) gene leads to defects in axonal growth in specific cranial, spinal, and phrenic nerves, as well as dorsal motor nerves in fore- and hindlimbs. In Fz3-/- limbs, dorsal axons stall at a specific location in the nerve plexus, and affected motor neurons undergo cell death prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death. This provides evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. The vertebrate nervous system is highly evolved, with precisely orchestrated patterns of neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and the establishment of specific synaptic connections. For neurons with distant targets, making the appropriate connections depends on accurate long-range navigation by their growing axons. Frizzled receptors are widely expressed in the developing mouse CNS and mediate at least three distinct types of signaling, including tissue polarity (PCP) signaling which acts in many epithelia and features the asymmetric localization of Frizzled and several other proteins in plasma membrane complexes to control cytoskeletal organization. In mammals, two of the ten Frizzled family members, Frizzled3 (Fz3) and Fz6, appear to be devoted largely or exclusively to tissue polarity signaling. Among Frizzled receptors, Fz3 is unique in its role in controlling axon guidance in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is required for the development of major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, and the thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and nigrostriatal tracts. Fz3 appears to be part of a system that provides directional information to growing axons. In the present work, the authors identified a hitherto unrecognized role for Fz3 in the growth of motor axons, and Fz3 is required for a subset of cranial and spinal motor axons to grow to their peripheral targets. In the limb, the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among LMCL axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in several other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, providing in vivo evidence for the general idea that as growing axons arrive at intermediate targets essential survival signals are relayed to their cell bodies.
Transposable elements (TEs) have been found to play a role in establishing gene regulatory networks during early mouse development, particularly in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the blastocyst. A subset of TE families, namely RLTR9, RLTR13D6, RLTR1
C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that has independently evolved in at least 60 plant lineages, is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. A meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3-C4 forms of photosynthesis was conducted to parameterize a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. The analysis revealed that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers, indicating that the convergent evolution of this complex trait is facilitated by its flexibility. The convergent evolution of complex traits is common in nature, including the camera-like eyes of cephalopods, vertebrates, and cnidaria, mimicry in invertebrates and vertebrates, and the different photosynthetic machineries of plants. The mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution, such as C4 photosynthesis, on an underlying phenotype landscape can inform approaches being undertaken to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species. The C4 pathway is estimated to have first evolved between 32 and 25 million years ago in response to multiple ecological drivers, including decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. C4 species have since radiated to represent the most productive crops and native vegetation on the planet because modifications to their leaves increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in the sub-tropics and tropics. However, while a substantial amount of work has addressed the molecular alterations that generate the biochemical differences between C3 and C4 plants, much less is known about the order and flexibility with which phenotypic traits important for C4 photosynthesis are acquired. To address these unknown aspects of C4 evolutionary history, a predictive model of how the full C4 phenotype evolved was developed by combining the concept of considering evolutionary paths as stochastic processes on complex adaptive landscapes with the analysis of extant C3-C4 intermediate species.
SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in the sporulation of Bacillus subtilis. It is a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases that has evolved from a GTPase to an ATPase. The evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear, but a study reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. The results showed that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, is critical in specific biological functions. The study also suggests that the increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA. Nucleotides have various functions in the cell, including coenzymes, signaling messengers, and the building blocks of genetic material. Nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) store energy in the form of their phosphate bonds, and the free energy of the hydrolysis reaction involving the bond between the β- and the γ-phosphates is approximately 30 kJ/mol. Despite this similarity between different NTPs, enzymes usually display strong preferences toward a specific NTP. For example, ATP is the principal source of energy in a cell and is used by motor proteins to perform work, whereas hydrolysis of GTP typically functions as a timer or switch, such as in proteins involved in signal transduction. The relative intracellular abundance of ATP in a cell drove the evolution of motors to use it as an energy source, and the eukaryotic ATPase motor proteins myosin and kinesin are examples of this evolutionary trend. In contrast, SpoIVA, an unusual bacterial ATPase, is a cytoskeletal protein that assembles into a static polymer in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. The selective pressure that drove the evolution of nucleotide preference in SpoIVA is unclear, but the study suggests that it was due to a pronounced reduction in intracellular GTP concentration relative to ATP during the late stages of sporulation.
The hormone leptin, which signals energy balance to the brain, has a well-known role in energy homeostasis but also affects developmental processes, particularly in the brain. In mice, leptin regulation is critical during early life, and changes in leptin signaling during development can have long-term effects on energy homeostasis and the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life. A study on mice with a null mutation in the leptin receptor (LepR) gene found that the absence of leptin signaling in early life led to irreversible obesity, suppressed energy expenditure, and defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Additionally, leptin reactivation in adulthood resulted in persistent reductions in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt, and Prlh mRNA expression. While exogenous leptin replacement can reverse key metabolic abnormalities in leptin-deficient mice or humans, the actual importance of leptin signaling during development for long-term energy homeostasis is not fully understood. Indeed, a separate study found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, the absence of leptin signaling in early life permanently impairs energy homeostasis, the melanocortin system, and the reproduction and brain development. These findings highlight the importance of leptin signaling during development and the long-term consequences of its absence in early life.
The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2, which recognizes the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22, activates defenses through the kinase BIK1. Heterotrimeric G proteins, including the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2, are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses. In the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, functioning together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1, enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. This study demonstrates that G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms. FLS2, a Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR), forms a dynamic complex with the co-receptor BAK1 and the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 to perceive flg22 and activate defense responses. Stability of FLS2 and BIK1 is subject to regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and a calcium-dependent protein kinase. Heterotrimeric G proteins, central for signaling in animals, also play important roles in various biological processes in plants, including cell division, meristem maintenance, root morphogenesis, seed development and germination, nitrogen assimilation, and response to ABA, low temperature, and blue light. Recent reports indicate that heterotrimeric G proteins play an important role in plant disease resistance against diverse pathogens, including XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2, which mediate immune responses downstream of PRRs.
The circadian clock of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a complex system that regulates gene expression and coordinates various processes, including stomatal opening, photosynthesis, and hypocotyl elongation. While a genetic circuit consisting of multiple coupled feedback loops has been proposed to generate the 24-hour rhythm, the robustness of the clock at the single-cell level and how clock timing is coordinated across the plant remain unclear. Recent studies using a reporter for the core clock gene CCA1 reveal robust single-cell oscillations, albeit desynchronized, with two waves of clock activity observed in the root: one going down and one up the root. Cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, particularly in the root tip, has been observed, and a simple model suggests that cell-to-cell coupling and measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves. These findings suggest that the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points, unlike the centralized mammalian clock. Overall, the plant circadian clock system has a complex structure and robustness, with tissue-dependent differences and decentralized coordination that allows for flexibility and differential responses to environmental perturbations.
The study discusses the difficulty in diagnosing hidden hearing disorders in patients with clinically normal hearing but who report reduced hearing. The researchers found that only 19,952 out of 106,787 patient records had no clinical evidence of hearing loss, and 45% of these individuals primarily complained of decreased hearing or hearing loss. Despite having clean bills of hearing health, many of these individuals had difficulties with speech intelligibility, particularly in listening conditions with multiple overlapping speakers. A multi-stage research study was conducted with 23 young or middle-aged listeners with clinically normal audiograms who reported difficulties in speech intelligibility. The study found that speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely across a 0-7 dB SNR range with a mean of 2.42 dB, and were significantly correlated with the subjects’ self-reported difficulties in multi-speaker conditions. The researchers then explored whether simple adaptations of existing clinical tests could identify deficits in multi-talker speech intelligibility, and found that poor processing of sTFS cues had a strong correlation with elevated speech recognition thresholds, particularly in patients with hearing loss. The study also found that the magnitude of the FMFR, a non-invasive physiological measure of neural sTFS phase-locking at early stages of auditory processing, was highly predictive of an individual’s performance on the FM psychophysical detection task and was significantly correlated with thresholds on the competing digits task. The data suggest that the strong association between psychophysical tests for FM detection and speech-in-noise intelligibility can be attributed, at least in part, to encoding of FM cues at early stages of auditory processing. The researchers concluded that the FMFR could provide an objective neurophysiological measure of an individual’s ability to encode sTFS cues, and that the measure was specifically linked to encoding of task-relevant FM cues and not a general sensitivity to unrelated sTFS cues.
The transparency of the mammalian eye allows for the noninvasive viewing of the microvessels of the retina, which is a part of the central nervous system. However, imperfections in the eye's optics can blur the view of microscopic retinal capillaries and single blood cells flowing within. To overcome this, researchers used 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to measure single-cell blood flow in the retina of the widely used C57BL/6J mouse. This method allowed for the measurement of blood flow without the need for surgery or contrast dyes, and ranged from 0.0002 to 1.55 µL min-1 across a full spectrum of retinal vessel diameters (3.2-45.8 µm). This technology has the potential to improve the early evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries and could potentially lead to earlier detection and treatment of retinal vascular diseases.
In the study of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms, SYMBIOSIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SYMRK) has been identified as a crucial component in the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. However, the mechanisms that differentiate between these two distinct symbiotic developmental fates have been unclear. This study demonstrates that Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1), NFR5, and SYMRK can initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 associates with endogenous SYMRK in roots of the legume Lotus japonicus. Furthermore, epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signaling independently of either the NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. The receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development. Plants establish mutualistic symbioses with AM fungi or nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and Frankia bacteria to circumvent nutrient deficiencies. In legumes, Nodulation factor application induces calcium-spiking in root hair cells. The NFR5-related LysM-RLK from Parasponia has been pinpointed as a likely candidate for the perception of lipo-chitooligosaccharides from AM fungi. The common symbiosis genes of legumes are required for AM and root nodule symbiosis. A subset of these genes is essential for either the generation or the decoding of calcium-spiking. In L. japonicus, the former group encodes the RLK SYMRK, two cation-permeable ion channels, and the latter group encodes Calcium Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase (CCaMK) and CYCLOPS, which form a complex that has been implicated in the deciphering of calcium-spiking. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms that ensure the appropriate cellular response for AM fungi and rhizobia.
DeepLearning Methods Improve Animal Pose Estimation in Behavioral SciencesThe use of automated methods for measuring animal behavior has become increasingly popular, with advances in imaging technologies and sophisticated tags providing high-quality behavioral data. Computer vision hardware and software developments have led to the use of image-based methods for measuring behavior across various experimental contexts. While early methods required controlled laboratory conditions, animals exhibit different behaviors based on their surroundings, making it essential to track them in natural settings. However, conventional computer vision methods have limitations in accurately tracking groups of individuals over time and quantifying detailed descriptions of an animal’s posture.Deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has opened new possibilities for accurately tracking animals and measuring their body posture in nearly any context. Using convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on manually annotated data, or training sets, these algorithms can estimate the locations of an animal’s body parts directly from images. Deep learning models can generalize human-level expertise at scale after training on only a relatively small number of examples, providing near human-level accuracy in almost any scenario.Recent studies have demonstrated the use of CNNs for animal pose estimation, achieving near human-level accuracy with few training examples. However, these models typically need large amounts of training data. Techniques such as iteratively refining the training set and active learning can ensure generalization to large datasets by reducing annotation time and refining training data.DeepLabCut, a deep learning-based method developed by Mathis et al. (2018), has shown promising results in animal pose estimation. Based on the ResNet architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model used for image classification, DeepLabCut incorporates a pre-trained encoder to improve performance and reduce the number of required training examples through transfer learning. However, this pre-trained architecture may come with the cost of slow inference due to overparameterization.Pereira et al. (2019) introduced a modified version of SegNet called LEAP, which attempts to limit model complexity and overparameterization for maximizing inference speed. While the LEAP model is explicitly designed for fast inference, it has disadvantages, such as reduced robustness to data variance and inability to generalize to new experimental setups.In summary, recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in animal pose estimation for behavioral sciences, providing high-quality and diverse behavioral data for scientific inquiry. Deep learning-based methods such as DeepLabCut and LEAP offer near human-level accuracy in estimating animal body part locations, making it possible to measure animal posture in various contexts, including in the wild.
Inflammasomes, which are multi-protein complexes that trigger inflammatory responses and a form of cell death called pyroptosis, play a crucial role in the immune response of innate immune cells like macrophages to environmental stress and pathogen infection. A study has identified an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop in NADH levels and the induction of mitochondrial ROS production, which can be rescued by the addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for the host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, which can disrupt metabolism by taking up host-cell glucose. This reveals an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.
Breast Cancer Associated proteins 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2) and Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) are tumor suppressors linked to a spectrum of malignancies, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PALB2 plays a crucial role in homology-directed repair (HDR) by coordinating the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and interacting with several chromatin proteins. A major DNA-binding site of PALB2 has been identified, mutations in which reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency in cells by 50%. PALB2's N-terminal DNA-binding domain (N-DBD) stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase and possesses strand exchange activity, even in the absence of RAD51. PALB2 can also use DNA and RNA substrates in the inverse strand exchange, highlighting its versatile DNA interaction properties and critical role in chromosome repair. BRCA1 and BRCA2 regulate an efficient non-mutagenic pathway of chromosome break repair and are essential mammalian proteins linked to a similar spectrum of cancers and Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 is part of a ubiquitous family of Recombination Mediator Proteins (RMPs) that stimulate the formation of recombinase filament on single-stranded DNA protected by ssDNA-binding proteins, such as SSB and RPA. PALB2 was discovered as a protein forming a complex with BRCA2 and regulating BRCA2 activity and interacts with many other chromatin proteins. The C-terminal WD40 domain of PALB2 interacts with BRCA2, while the N-terminus forms a complex with BRCA1, localizing at double-stranded DNA break sites at earlier stages of repair, inhibiting an alternative pathway of non-homologous end joining and initiating HDR through the recruitment of PALB2/BRCA2/RAD51. PALB2 is often described as the hub for a network of tumor suppressors, interacting with histones H3 and H2B, MRG15 protein, RAD51 and its paralogs, translesion DNA polymerase η, oxidative stress response protein KEAP1, and RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. PALB2 is ubiquitinylated in G1 phase of the cell cycle, leading to its degradation and restraining its activity in S/G2, and promotes the assembly of RAD51-ssDNA presynaptic nucleofilaments in the absence of BRCA2 in vitro. PALB2 recruits Polη to DSB sites and stimulates recombination-associated DNA synthesis by Polη. BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 proteins contain DNA binding domains (DBDs), the function of which is poorly understood. Most missense mutations in the BRCA2 DBD are pathogenic, and disruption of DNA binding in a BRCA2 truncation variant lacking the PALB2-binding motif leads to a significant HDR reduction. However, deletion of the BRCA2 DBD has a negligible effect when interaction with PALB2 is preserved, highlighting the functional importance of PALB2's DNA-binding property. Two truncation fragments of PALB2, T1 and T3, bind DNA, and the precise mechanism of DNA interaction and its functional role remain unknown. Mutations of four amino acids in PALB2's N-DBD significantly reduce RAD51 foci formation and the efficiency of HDR in a model cell system. PALB2 N-DBD by itself stimulates RAD51 strand exchange reactions and supports both forward and inverse strand exchange even in the absence of RAD51 and can use RNA as a substrate. Altogether, these data reveal a novel activity of PALB2 and highlight the importance of PALB2 DNA binding in chromosome maintenance.
The study reveals that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments arranged in an antiparallel fashion, which is different from the parallel arrangement seen in other actin-like proteins. The atomic structures of antiparallel protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB were determined using X-ray crystallography. These antiparallel protofilaments are essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance. In vivo site-specific cross-linking confirmed the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in E. coli. Three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (3D cryo-EM) showed that pairs of protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB tightly bind to membranes. Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerization states of Caulobacter MreB revealed conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. The antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilizing double protofilaments. The study provides new insights into the mechanism of action of antimicrobial agents that target MreB. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of antiparallel protofilament formation in MreB's function and its potential as a target for antimicrobial drugs.
The number of petals in a flower is an important invariant trait for reproductive success in many plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta. However, while A. thaliana has a consistent four-petal pattern, C. hirsuta shows variability in petal number both within and between plants, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. A study investigating the genetic basis for this difference found that the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 (AP1) is responsible for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness. The A. thaliana AP1 confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling petal number in C. hirsuta, while the C. hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function. Upstream regulatory regions of AP1 also contribute to this divergence. Despite sufficient genetic variation in C. hirsuta accessions to produce plants with four-petalled flowers, variable petal number is maintained due to the distribution of allelic effects. The evolution of petal number variation from a robust state in A. thaliana to a variable state in C. hirsuta is a complex process that involves both genetic and developmental factors. Understanding the genetic basis of developmental traits and how they evolve is a major goal of evolutionary developmental biology.
The biosynthesis of insulin, critical to metabolic homeostasis, involves the folding of the proinsulin precursor and the formation of disulfide bonds. A subset of proinsulin molecules in pancreatic islets has free cysteine thiol, and under conditions of ER stress, non-native proinsulin enters intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. This is observed in genetically obese mice, where disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant and track with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. Proinsulin-Cys (B19)-Cys (B19) covalent homodimers resist reductive dissication, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation. Increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with β-cell dysfunction in type two diabetes.The progression of β-cell dysfunction with ER stress in prediabetes to β-cell failure with full-blown type two diabetes (T2D) has been subject to intensive investigation. A chronic increase in insulin secretory demand leads to depletion of β-cell secretory granule reserves despite a dramatic compensatory increase in secretory pathway activity. Pancreatic sections of human subjects with T2D show a marked increase of ER volume density in β-cells with an induction of ER stress markers triggered by high glucose exposure. Similar indicators of ER stress have been established in the β-cells of animal models, such as leptin receptor-deficient diabetic mice, which develop insulin resistance progressing to T2D, linked to overeating. Proinsulin misfolding has been proposed to increase proinsulin misfolding and promote ER stress with abnormal β-cell ER expansion. Insulin-deficiency caused directly by proinsulin misfolding has been proved unequivocally in an autosomal-dominant form of diabetes known as Mutant INS-gene-induced Diabetes of Youth (MIDY). The disease in humans is pathogenetically identical to that seen in the mutant Akita diabetic mouse or Munich MIDY Pig, which are animals expressing one mutant INS allele encoding proinsulin-C (A7) Y that is quantitatively misfolded due to an inability to form the Cys (B7) -Cys (A7) disulfide bond. Expression of only one WT INS allele would be sufficient to avoid diabetes, but Akita mice develop diabetes despite expressing three alleles encoding WT proinsulin in addition to the one encoding mutant proinsulin. MIDY is a rare disease, but β-cell failure accompanies ‘garden variety’ T2D without INS mutations. In this condition, β-cell ER stress is a recognized part of the disease, but the molecular pathogenesis of insulin deficiency remains murky. It has been suggested that β-cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production that may eventually overwhelm the ER capacity for efficient protein folding, thereby provoking β-cell ER stress. However, in the absence of INS gene mutations, it has not been established the extent to which proinsulin misfolding is present in the early triggering stages of T2D, including prediabetes and mild dysglycemia.
The protein Suv39H is a major histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) -specific methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in assembling silent heterochromatin, particularly in pericentric regions. It achieves this by recognizing trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) via its chromodomain and targeting specific chromosomal regions enriched with H3K9me3. However, the mechanisms through which Suv39H targets naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3 are not well understood. Recent studies have shown that Suv39h1's chromodomain (Suv39h1-CD) can bind nucleic acids, and this binding is important for its function in heterochromatin assembly. Specifically, Suv39h1-CD has a higher binding affinity for RNA than DNA, and this ability is independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Suv39h1 binds major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowers Suv39h1 retention on pericentromere. Moreover, Suv39h1's nucleic acid-binding and H3K9me3-binding activities are both crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly. These findings suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating Suv39H's target specificity. Heterochromatin is a highly condensed chromatin structure that can be divided into constitutive heterochromatin (CH) and facultative heterochromatin. CH consists of repetitive DNA and is generally transcriptionally silent, and its higher-order chromatin structure can spread, causing the heritable inactivation of genes adjacent to the CH. The establishment of CH is tightly correlated with changes in posttranslational histone-tail modifications, particularly the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), which creates specific binding sites for H3K9me3 reader molecules such as HP1 proteins. These epigenetic states are maintained throughout replication. CH is critical for functional chromosomal domains such as the pericentromere, and epigenetic pericentromere layers are important for accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis and for genome stability. SUV39H (1 and 2), an H3K9me3 methyltransferase in mammals, targets CH domains and intact transposons, and H3K9me3 in the pericentric regions is mainly catalyzed by SUV39H. In Suv39h1/2 double-knockout cells, the H3K9me3 levels over the pericentromere are severely diminished, and HP1 proteins do not accumulate. The nature of CH and its epigenetic machineries are well conserved in various species, including fission yeast and flies. In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the RNAi-dependent pathway is essential for pericentric heterochromatin formation and maintenance, and the process of pericentric transcription is coupled with the targeting of the SUV39H homologue Clr4 to chromatin. In the Drosophila ovary, a similar small-RNA-mediated process promotes transcriptional silencing by H3K9me3 and by HP1A, an HP1-family protein in flies. However, it is not clear whether the RNAi-dependent pathway or another RNA-based mechanism is involved in the process of establishing and maintaining heterochromatin in mammals. Suv39h-family proteins have two functionally distinct domains: the N-terminal chromodomain (CD) and the C-terminal SET domain. The CD functions as a binding module that targets H3K9me3 marks, and the SET domain is responsible for SUV39H’s enzymatic activity. However, this mechanism alone is not sufficient for converting H3K9me3-free, naïve chromosomal regions to silent heterochromatin. A recent study demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD can bind nucleic acids, and this binding is crucial for Suv39h1’s function. Suv39h-CD prefers to bind ssRNA
A study on the entorhinal cortex of monkeys has found that entorhinal neurons, specifically grid cells, do not rely on physical movement to activate. Grid cells are known for their role in precise decoding of an organism's position in space and navigation. However, recent hypotheses suggest that they may contribute more generally to mental operations. The prerequisite for this hypothesis is that grid cell activity does not critically depend on physical movement. The study found that covert attention movements, without any physical movement, elicit spatial receptive fields with a triangular tiling of space. A significant population of entorhinal cells with spatially structured receptive fields was identified, contrasting with recordings obtained in the hippocampus. This suggests that entorhinal cortex neurons do not rely on physical movement. Spatial representations, in the form of place cells and grid cells, have been identified in various species, including rodents, bats, macaque monkeys, and humans. Grid cells are potentially capable of representing not only gaze location but the locus of attention in general. The study findings provide evidence that grid cells can represent information apart from the animal’s current location, consistent with previous reports of grid-like six-fold symmetric BOLD activity during imagination-based spatial tasks. The data demonstrate that entorhinal cells with grid-like firing fields can similarly encode information apart from the animal’s current location, emphasizing the potential role of grid cells in various cognitive functions beyond spatial navigation.
A standardized task to probe decision-making in mice was developed and tested across multiple laboratories to address the reproducibility issue in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. The task, a two-alternative forced-choice perceptual detection task with a changing stimulus probability, was adopted and trained in seven laboratories with 140 mice. The results showed that after training, most mice learned the task, and their performance was comparable across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted a similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability. The data and open-access tools, including over 5 million mouse choices, are publicly available. This standardized task and open-science approach provide a foundation for achieving reproducibility in neuroscience and studying decision-making in mice. The study also highlights the importance of collaboration, data and technique sharing, and automation in improving the reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.
The digestive system's proper function and repair are crucial for most animals, and understanding the mechanisms involved requires an atlas of gene expression and cell types. This has been studied in the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea, which can regenerate all organs, including the gut. Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-seq were used to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of S. mediterranea. This resulted in the identification of hundreds of genes with intestinal expression that were previously undetected. Systematic analyses revealed conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Spatial LCM uncovered regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly among intestinal goblet cells. Two intestine-enriched transcription factors that specifically regulate regeneration or maintenance of goblet cells were also identified. This work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration.
Mormyrid fishes have different sensory perceptions due to modifications in their sensory systems, particularly in their electrosensory receptors. These differences in sensory perception have led to adaptations in their social environments. The fishes that can detect subtle variations in electric communication signals have broadly distributed spiking receptors that encode signal waveform into spike-timing differences between sensory receptors. On the other hand, fishes that are insensitive to waveform variation have receptors that produce spontaneously oscillating potentials, which respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors. These receptors are most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, indicating their specialization for group signal detection. These findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony. Anatomical modifications of sensory receptors and the associated brain pathway that processes electric communication signals have led to a newfound ability to detect subtle variations in these signals, resulting in a dramatic increase in the rates of signal evolution and species diversification.
Bacteriophage BPP-1 is a short-tailed, dsDNA virus that infects and kills Bordetella species responsible for whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in other mammals. It has a T = 7l icosahedral capsid, ≈670 Å in diameter, and contains a 42.5 kb genome that encodes up to 50 viral proteins. The two most abundant protein bands in BPP-1 virions are Bbp17 (MCP) and Bbp16 (CP), which are the major capsid protein and cement protein, respectively. BPP-1 has an HK97-like fold but with an additional protein component in the shell. The HK97 fold is present in many dsDNA bacteriophage capsids, some T-phages, lambdoid phages, herpesviruses, and eukaryotic herpesviruses. BPP-1 is an attractive phage-display system for bioengineering due to its unique and well-characterized diversity-generating retro-element (DGR), which can introduce targeted diversity into protein-coding DNA sequences to accelerate the evolution of adaptive traits. A 3.5 Å resolution cryoEM structure of the BPP-1 head determined by single-particle analysis revealed that its capsid protein (MCP) and cement protein (CP) have an HK97-like fold and jellyroll fold, respectively. The MCP fold topology is permuted non-circularly from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. The new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old topology. β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering.
Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus that cycles between mosquito and mammalian hosts, and prior research has shown that DENV populations can adapt to different host environments through the accumulation of specific mutations. A recent study used serial passage in human and mosquito cell lines and estimated fitness effects for all single-nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. The results showed that the influx of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations to shape the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster to defined regions in the genome, suggesting that these adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation.The evolutionary constraints described in this simple system mirror trends observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating that it recapitulates key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of virus populations in controlled experimental systems can reveal biological constraints on the viral genome, molecular mechanisms of viral adaptation, and fundamental biophysical and population genetic principles governing molecular evolution in general.Emerging deep-sequencing techniques allow for the probing of the mutational landscape and the ability to observe the full spectrum of diversity in samples from evolving viral populations. High-accuracy sequencing approaches, such as Circular Sequencing (CirSeq), can detect alleles as rare as 1 in 106 in frequency, enabling the observation of the full spectrum of diversity in samples from evolving viral populations.The study used CirSeq to characterize the fitness landscapes of DENV populations adapting to the distinct environments and cellular machineries of human and mosquito cells by tracing individual allele trajectories for almost all possible single nucleotide variants across the DENV genome. The analysis revealed the influence of both positive and negative selection in shaping the evolutionary paths of DENV in these distinct cellular environments.In summary, the study provides insights into genetic and biophysical principles of flaviviral evolution and reveals parallels between long- and short-term evolutionary scales. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of DENV and other arboviruses can help in the development of novel control strategies for these important human pathogens.
Membrane nanodomains play a crucial role in Ras signaling, although the exact nature of these domains and their interaction with Ras are not well understood. A study using single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) and trajectory analysis examined the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D (an active KRas mutant) in U2OS cells. The results showed that KRasG12D exhibits an immobile state in ~70 nm domains, each embedded in a larger domain of ~200 nm that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. The diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels. These findings suggest that membrane organization plays a significant role in membrane diffusion and trafficking of Ras, providing new insights into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling. The plasma membrane's complex and dynamic landscape regulates how diverse membrane-localized signaling molecules behave, including the Ras small GTPases. While the biochemical aspects of Ras interactions with downstream effectors are well studied, the mechanisms through which the biological membrane defines the signaling activity and specificity of Ras are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that Ras signaling may involve the formation of multimers in a membrane-dependent manner, and that partitioning of Ras into nanoscopic membrane domains and interactions with scaffold proteins or structures likely constitute critical steps to Ras multimer formation and signaling. However, previous high-resolution imaging experiments have provided limited information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras-membrane domain interactions. Live-cell single-particle tracking (SPT) complements static imaging by providing information about molecular motions and has been used to study Ras dynamics on the membrane. SPT has revealed that interactions of Ras with different membrane domains and signaling partners manifest as varied diffusion behavior. However, the technical constraints of traditional SPT have limited the imaging throughput and depth of analysis. Recent advances in both experimental and data analysis strategies of SPT have overcome these limitations, enabling the acquisition of thousands of diffusion trajectories from a single cell and facilitating spt-PALM data analysis.
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling patterns the dorsoventral embryonic axis through a gradient. In vertebrates, this gradient is traditionally believed to be formed by a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling, resulting in peak signaling levels. However, a study in zebrafish found that BMP gradient formation is actually driven by a source-sink mechanism, where a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acts as a sink, driving BMP flux dorsally. BMP diffusion measurements support this model, suggesting a new mechanism for shaping BMP gradients during development. Morphogens, such as BMPs, are crucial for specifying multiple cell fates in a gradient and their formation is diverse and complex. A source of morphogen flowing to a sink that destroys it, as proposed by Francis Crick in 1970, is now known to be just one of many mechanisms. BMPs act as morphogens repeatedly during development, including in patterning the embryonic dorsoventral axis, the neural tube, and the dorsal-ventral (DV) and anterior-posterior (AP) embryonic axes. BMP morphogen systems are established by a network of extracellular regulators, including BMP antagonists. These antagonists bind BMP ligand with high affinity, preventing ligand-receptor interaction and promoting dorsal cell fate specification. In zebrafish, Chordin is expressed in a larger domain than Noggin and Follistatin and can be cleaved by the metalloprotease Tolloid, releasing bound BMP ligand and allowing it to signal. The Drosophila ortholog of Chordin, Sog, can act as both a BMP agonist and as an antagonist during DV patterning, shuttling BMP ligand from lateral regions to dorsal regions to steepen the BMP signaling gradient and specify the dorsal-most cell fates in the Drosophila embryo. However, it is unclear whether Chordin shuttles BMP in patterning vertebrate tissues. The mechanism by which the BMP ligands and antagonists shape the gradient in vertebrates is unclear, with several potential mechanisms proposed, including an inverse gradient of BMP antagonists imparting the shape, BMP antagonists generating peak BMP signaling levels by shuttling BMP ligand to these regions, the gradient shape mirroring the shape of the bmp expression domain, and the gradient being generated by BMP diffusing from its ventral source to a dorsal sink of BMP antagonists. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and multiple may act in combination.
MFSD1 is a hitherto uncharacterized lysosomal transporter that plays a crucial role in maintaining normal levels of GLMP, another lysosomal protein, and forms a stable and functional relevant lysosomal transporter complex with it. Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that play a major role in intracellular degradation of macromolecules and export of catabolic end-products. MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated, contains a dileucine-based sorting motif for its transport to lysosomes, and is widely expressed in murine tissues, including the liver, kidney, and spleen. MFSD1 deficiency leads to a severe liver disease characterized by extravasation of erythrocytes, sinusoidal damage, loss of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and fibrosis. The lack of N-glycosylation of MFSD1 is unusual for a lysosomal membrane protein. The transport of MFSD1 to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in the N-terminus.
A study using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) reconstructions at 5-6 Å resolution, X-ray structures, and molecular dynamics flexible fitting simulations has provided new insights into the mechanism of microtubule-based transport by kinesin motors, which is essential for various vital processes in eukaryotes. The researchers found that microtubule attachment, mediated by a conserved ‘linchpin’ residue in kinesin, triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft, coupling tightly to translocation of cargo via kinesin's ‘neck linker’ element. These transitions are similar to the nucleotide-exchange steps in myosin and F1-ATPase motors. The two heads of a kinesin dimer ‘gate’ each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules. The kinesin superfamily plays a fundamental role in the cellular life cycle and is a therapeutic drug target. Understanding the basic structural and functional features of this motor at the molecular level is of significant interest due to its importance in health and disease.
Mitochondria require quality control (QC) mechanisms to eliminate damaged proteins and maintain organellar integrity. While much is known about QC pathways in other cellular locations, mitochondrial proteins QC is less well-established. This study aimed to define a QC pathway for non-native proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) using temperature-sensitive (ts-) peripheral MOM proteins as model QC substrates. The authors established that sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts, ts- MOM proteins, are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in a temperature-dependent manner. Ubiquitination of sam35-2HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Ubr1, while san1 primarily ubiquitinates sen2-1HAts. The mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1. Additionally, the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor Ubx2 are involved in their degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguish it from other cellular QC pathways. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the MAD pathway for non-native proteins, providing insights into the mitochondrial QC mechanism.
The study utilizes a FRET biosensor for ERK to visualize ERK activity in living mice and discovers radial propagation of ERK activation in the epidermis under steady-state conditions. This Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD) occurs from a few cells and propagates up to 50 μm with decreasing amplitude until it disappears. The frequency of SPREAD correlates with the rate of epidermal cell division, and is stimulated by TPA in an EGF receptor and MMP-dependent manner. SPREAD is also associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Another type of ERK activation propagation pattern is observed in wounded skin, where waves of ERK activation propagate in parallel with the wound edge. This study highlights the dynamic regulation of growth signal in steady-state and wounded skin.
Circadian clocks are biological oscillations that schedule daily changes in physiology and are driven by external cues whose timing varies with the seasons. Cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria, must contend with large seasonal variations in day length and have a core oscillator responsible for driving genome-wide transcriptional rhythms that can be reconstituted using purified KaiABC proteins. However, it is unclear how the cyanobacterial clock functions when driven by light-dark cycles that mimic days in different seasons. To study this, researchers developed multiplexed LED illumination devices to grow cyanobacteria in a wide range of light-dark conditions and found that the circadian rhythm in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 follows a simple rule: the phase of clock-driven gene expression scales linearly with day length and remains fixed relative to the middle of the day over a wide range of day lengths. The core biochemical oscillator comprised of the Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro. These findings suggest that such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins and can be used to predict clock behavior under many cycling environments. Additionally, understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for seasonal adaptation in cyanobacteria may provide insight into the features oscillators must have to respond appropriately to varying light-dark cycles and how those features are implemented molecularly in specific systems.
Meis1, a transcription factor of the TALE homeobox gene family, has been identified as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD) through genome-wide association studies. In the mouse neural crest, Meis1 inactivation leads to altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects, thereby increasing the susceptibility to SCD. Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation, and Meis1 deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages. Meis1 also regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery, and the traffic of Rab5+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. These results suggest that Meis1 interacts with various trophic factors signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons differentiation. SCD is a major cause of mortality in the general population, and ventricular arrhythmias are identifiable in almost all cardiac diseases. Congenital cardiac innervation defects or dysfunction are largely implicated in SCD and often involve molecules that are essential for the developmental guidance and axonal growth of cardiac sympathetic nerves. Two independent genome-wide association studies have emphasized Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. Meis1 is involved in the early steps of sympathetic neurons development, including the transcriptional network that instructs neural crest cells to a sympathetic fate and a noradrenergic phenotype, and the actions of locally secreted ligands of various families of trophic factors that allow sympathetic axons to reach the vicinity of target organs. Retrograde Ntrk1/Ngf signaling is involved in distal axonal growth and target-field innervation, and Meis1 regulates the transcription of proteins necessary for retrograde transport, endosomes formation, functioning and traffic. Accordingly, following specific inactivation of Meis1 in peripheral neurons, the traffic of Rab5+ early endosomes is impaired and sympathetic target-field innervation is compromised.
In this study, researchers explore the mechanics of biofilm surface morphology using Vibrio cholerae as a model system. They find that mechanical instabilities such as wrinkling and delamination, driven by interfacial energy and the expanding biofilm's growth mismatch with the non-growing substrate, shape biofilm topography. The findings demonstrate that bacterial biofilms offer a valuable system for quantitative investigation of mechanomorphogenesis. The study also highlights the significance of mechanical forces in the formation of living entity morphologies and the role of growth mismatches in generating mechanical stresses and shape instabilities, which depend on biological constituents' mechanical and geometric properties. These insights contribute to understanding the developmental patterns of bacterial cells in communities and the processes governing morphogenesis in higher organisms.
Epileptic neuronal networks develop following insults such as severe seizures, and a transcription factor known as NRSF/REST influences this development. A study found that epilepsy-provoking seizures decrease NRSF levels in the mature hippocampus and repress a subset of NRSF target genes, specifically those with mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor. These genes code for ion channels, receptors, and other crucial contributors to neuronal function, suggesting their repression may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. NRSF mRNA and protein expression increase in the hippocampus following long seizures, and this increase in NRSF expression is directly dependent on network activity. NRSF-regulated genes are preferentially repressed by epilepsy-provoking network hyperactivity, indicating a correlation between NRSF levels and the repression of these genes. A twofold to threefold increase in NRSF levels leads to the repression of only a subset of potentially regulated genes, and these are rescued by interfering with NRSF function. This repression requires binding of NRSF to the chromatin. In mature hippocampus, preventing the binding of the repressor to target genes has little effect on most genes, but a significant number of NRSE-containing genes repressed by seizures are no longer significantly repressed when NRSF binding to target genes is inhibited. Therefore, a twofold to threefold change in NRSF levels influences the expression of only a subset of putative NRSF target genes in a seizure-dependent manner.
The study investigates the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells (MCs and TCs) in the olfactory system of mice and how they best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges. The research found that MCs and TCs have different activity-dependent lateral inhibition, likely due to newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. These circuit-level differences allow MCs and TCs to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, suggesting that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways. Throughout the brain, lateral inhibitory circuits enhance contrast and facilitate discrimination of similar stimuli by decorrelating neural responses. In the olfactory bulb, lateral inhibition occurs between pairs of MCs or TCs via reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with inhibitory granule cells. The study finds that lateral inhibition most strongly affects MCs firing at intermediate rates, while TCs are affected when firing at low rates. This difference arises due to differential recruitment of morphologically distinct classes of GCs by MCs and TCs. Simulations show that these circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs influence odor discrimination, enabling TCs and MCs to collectively encode odors better than either population alone and supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type.
The M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototype for allosteric interactions in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), has an orthosteric site and a topographically distinct allosteric site. The allosteric site is located at the extracellular surface within a vestibule to the orthosteric site and shows low sequence homology among muscarinic subtypes, making it more subtype-specific. Allosteric ligands are of interest for their therapeutic potential. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, including the M2 muscarinic receptor, exhibit positive or negative allosteric effects that are typically measured in terms of interactions between two binding sites on a monomeric receptor. However, complex binding profiles, such as a bell-shaped dependence on the concentration of an allosteric modulator, suggest the presence of up to four allosteric sites on a single receptor molecule or linked sites within an oligomer. A FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and pharmacological assays involving mutants have been used to compare monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor. Allosteric effects in monomers are exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers can be positive or negative, depending on the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and arise from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is consistent with muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.
SETD2, the enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling, but these cells failed to activate p5
The paper analyzes a new missense variant, Rasgrp1Anaef, in mice with an ENU-mutated EF hand in the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rasgrp1. The Rasgrp1Anaef mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantibodies and a CD44hi Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population that is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK activation in vitro, thymocyte selection is mostly normal in vivo. CD44 expression is identified as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling through a novel mouse strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function mutation in Mtor. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in Rasgrp1Anaef naïve CD4+ T cells, and CD44 expression, CD4+ T cell subset ratios, and serum autoantibodies all return to normal in Rasgrp1AnaefMtorchino double-mutant mice, demonstrating that increased mTOR activity is essential for the Rasgrp1Anaef T cell dysregulation. This study highlights the importance of understanding the regulation of Rasgrp1 in T lymphocytes and its in vivo importance, as well as the potential link between Rasgrp1 and mTOR signaling. Additionally, the study underscores the potential impact of missense gene variants in human genetic variation and the need for mouse models to understand the pathogenesis of complex human immune diseases.
In the field of cancer research, mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family are common and associated with poor understanding of how they affect tumorigenesis. A study modeled the effect of loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit Arid1a in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation by suppressing Arid1a in the mouse pancreas in the setting of oncogenic KrasG12D. The results showed that Arid1a cooperates with Kras in the adult pancreas, and its postnatal silencing following sustained KrasG12D expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. However, Arid1a silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with KrasG12D activation, leads to retention of acinar cell fate. These findings highlight Arid1a as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and the unanticipated influence of timing and genetic context on the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.Aberrant chromatin regulation is a hallmark of cancer, and subunits of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex show frequent mutation in many solid tumors. However, understanding of the underlying biology and molecular mechanisms remains limited. SWI/SNF complexes regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and their disruption is associated with changes in cell plasticity and oncogenes that drive cancer development. However, the role of various SWI/SNF complex components in tumor initiation and progression can be context-dependent.In the study described, researchers aimed to develop an in vivo model to address the role of the SWI/SNF component ARID1A in PDAC, which occurs in up to 25% of cancer patients and is nearly invariably initiated by activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene. They used a mouse-modeling platform that enables inducible and reversible disruption of gene function and found that Arid1a depletion can modulate the early stages of pancreatic neoplasia in a context-specific manner that depends on the timing of Arid1a inactivation and the presence of oncogenic Kras. These cell state transitions involve reprogramming events that are irreversible, unlike tissue regenerative responses.In summary, the study highlights the importance of the timing and genetic context in the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis, particularly in PDAC. The researchers developed a powerful mouse-modeling platform that enables inducible and reversible disruption of gene function, providing a valuable tool for further research in this field.
Social networks play a crucial role in buffering the effects of stress, and the absence of these networks can also be stressful. A study examining neuroendocrine PVN CRH neurons found that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in a sexually dimorphic manner. In females, isolation increased first spike latency (FSL) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons, but no such changes were observed in age-matched males. These changes were a result of social isolation and not acute physical stress, as shown by blocking the increase in FSL with a glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor and mimicking it with exogenous corticosterone. These results demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons. This finding is significant as the stress response is implicated in the emergence of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, many of which show sex-specific differences. Human studies suggest that young girls exhibit greater corticosteroid stress reactivity to social stress tests than boys, and females take greater advantage of social support to manage stress. Therefore, it is hypothesized that disrupting the social network would elicit neurobiological changes preferentially in female mice. The study found that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female, but not age-matched male mice. Both females and males show equivalent sensitivity to an acute physical stress, but a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent physical stress on FSL in females, but has no effect on FSL in males. These observations demonstrate that circulating CORT is necessary for stress-induced changes in FSL in both males and females. In conclusion, this study highlights the impact of social isolation on the stress response in a sexually dimorphic manner.
Hemoglobin (Hb) is a model protein used to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates. Its oxygen-binding affinity and cooperativity have long been thought to determine tissue oxygen delivery, but only affinity was considered to play a role in molecular adaptations of Hb. However, a new study suggests that both affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimize tissue oxygen delivery. The researchers derived a relationship between the Hill coefficient and relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed a 'biophysical Hill landscape' describing this relation. They found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape, allowing for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. These findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb and have wider implications for our understanding of molecular evolution. Understanding the relationship between protein sequence and organismal/population fitness and the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in the values of adaptive properties is crucial for understanding adaptive behavior in proteins. Hb is an excellent model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates, and its oxygen affinity and cooperativity are both adaptive traits. However, the adaptive potential of cooperativity has often been overlooked. Both the midpoint (p50) and slope (nH) of the oxygen saturation curve, which reflect the effective affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding by Hb, respectively, have been shown to be adaptive traits. For example, vertebrates native to mountain habitats have Hb with a higher affinity for oxygen than lowland dwellers, and Hb in small-sized animals presents lower affinity for oxygen than in large-sized animals, reflecting adaptive adjustments of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb. However, the traditional view has been that the p50 parameter, or 'oxygen unloading tension', is the primary determinant of Hb function, while nH has been largely ignored. This is surprising, given that nH also affects Hb tissue oxygen delivery. The study found that mammalian Hbs exhibit variations in the Hill cooperativity value, suggesting the adaptive potential of the nH trait. The values of both p50 and nH of Hb should reflect physiological optimization of the tradeoff between O2 loading in the lungs and O2 unloading in tissues, so as to optimize tissue oxygen delivery. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested experimentally. Therefore, the researchers tested whether the values of both p50 and nH of Hb are optimized in the case of body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb, relying on extensive evolutionary and physiological oxygen saturation datasets available for mammalian Hb proteins. The findings provide insight into the mechanism underlying the adaptive behavior of p50 and nH with respect to tissue oxygen delivery by mammalian Hb and their relation to organism fitness.
In this study, researchers used intravital microscopy in mice to examine the motility of Plasmodium sporozoites and their interaction with dermal blood vessels in the context of malaria infection. Sporozoites were found to exhibit two types of motility: avascular motility, characterized by high speed and less confinement, and constrained motility, which is slower and more confined, observed in the vicinity of blood vessels. The curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature was found to optimize contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlighted the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site. These findings contribute to the understanding of the early stages of Plasmodium infection and the role of sporozoite motility in the invasion of blood vessels.
In the field of cell biology, genetics, and systems biology, it has been discovered that cells are organized by functional modules, which typically contain components whose removal severely compromises the module's function. However, these components are not absolutely conserved between different parts of the tree of life, suggesting that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. A study on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker's yeast, supports this idea. The researchers evolved 1000 generations of yeast without the important polarity gene BEM1 and found that initially, the bem1Δ lineages rapidly increased in fitness and then slowly reached >90% of the fitness of their BEM1 ancestors at the end of the evolution. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization revealed a common evolutionary trajectory, with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. This study highlights the robustness of organisms to physiologically destructive perturbations and the role of gene inactivation in rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions. Additionally, it has been observed that components that are essential for a module in well-studied model organisms can be absent in evolutionarily distant organisms, indicating the reorganization of complex modules during evolution to accommodate changing requirements or to respond to the chance loss of components. Overall, further research is needed to understand the evolution of functional modules and the relationship between multiple adaptive mutations in different functional modules.
Neurobiologists have studied decision-making through tasks involving successive, independent choices between goods or gambles. However, choices often have lasting consequences, as when investing in a house or choosing a partner. In this study, humans decided whether to commit to prospects that provided sustained financial return. BOLD signals in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected or deferred accepting a prospect. These findings offer fresh insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions, and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex. Animals make choices that enhance their chances of positive reinforcement. Laboratory-based tasks have investigated reward-guided decision-making by requiring successive, independent choices in pursuit of a primary reinforcer or a flexible resource. For example, participants might be asked to choose between one of two abstract symbols to obtain a variable monetary reward, or decide which of two snacks they would like to eat upon completion of the experiment. In these tasks, decisions are often characterized by stereotyped biases that hinder outcome maximization, including a tendency to weight losses more heavily than gains (loss aversion) or an undue preference for an already endowed or ‘default’ option (status quo bias). In conjunction with single-cell recordings or functional neuroimaging, studies have revealed that two interconnected medial cortical regions, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC), play a pivotal role in reward-guided decision-making. The current work aimed to understand the computational mechanisms by which economic commitments are made in humans and the neural implementation in the reward circuitry of the medial prefrontal cortex.
Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies that control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level, specifically through the circadian nuclear retention of mRNA containing inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu) in their 3'-UTR. A study was conducted on pituitary cells, and it was found that all components of paraspeckles, including four major proteins and Neat1, displayed a circadian expression pattern. The insertion of IRAlu at the 3'-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA, which was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. Therefore, paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.Circadian rhythms are underpinned by daily rhythms of gene expression, and it has been apparent that substantial regulation is achieved after transcription, so post-transcriptional controls are emerging as crucial modulators of circadian clocks. While in eukaryotes, approximately 1%-10% genes are subjected to circadian control directly or indirectly, only ~1/5 of the mRNAs that display rhythmic expression are directly driven by transcription. Post-transcriptional mechanisms including RNA splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, mRNA cytoplasmic export and RNAs nuclear retention are essential layers for generation of gene expression rhythmicity. Paraspeckles are recently identified nuclear bodies that have been shown to retain RNAs in the nucleus. They contain proteins PSPC1, RBM14, NONO, and SFPQ and are usually detected as a variable number of discrete dots found in close proximity to nuclear speckles.Paraspeckles have been shown to retain in the nucleus RNAs containing duplex structures, and mRNAs containing IRAlus in their 3'-UTRs like Nicolin 1 (NICN1) or Lin 28 are retained in the nucleus in paraspeckles. Therefore, this nuclear retention pathway of IRAlus in 3'-UTRs of genes provides an additional layer of gene regulation by sequestering mature mRNAs within the nucleus. Moreover, a pair of IRAlus in the 3'-UTR of egfp can strongly silence EGFP expression in GH4C1 pituitary cell line, and after fractionating cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs from the two cell lines, it was observed that IRAlus-containing egfp mRNA appear to be preferentially retained in the nucleus in comparison with those having a single Alu element. It was found that IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA is associated with PSPC1 whereas Alu-containing egfp mRNA is not, providing evidence that nuclear retained IRAlus are associated with paraspeckle bodies. In GH4C1 cells, the circadian variations in Neat1 RNA levels are shown to reflect rhythmic variations in paraspeckle number within the cells.Paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene. In keeping with this view, IRAlu elements inserted in 3'-UTR of egfp reporter mRNA allow for its circadian retention within the nucleus and consequently for EGFP protein circadian expression. However, it may be noted that egfp mRNA displayed also a circadian nuclear retention when a single antisens Alu element was inserted in its 3'-UTR but in this case the variations of the ratio over the circadian period was highly reduced in contrast to the high amplitude circadian variations of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic ratio observed in IRAlu-egfp cell line. These small amplitude variations of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA contents in Alu-egfp cell line were further accompanied by a weak number of cells expressing a circadian pattern of EGFP expression. Nuclear retention of egfp mRNA in IRAlu-egfp cells is no more cycling when paraspeckles were disrupted, assuming that the nuclear retention of the reporter gene by paraspeckles contributes to cycling. To determine whether this paraspeckle impact on rhythmic gene expression occurs 'in vivo' on a much larger scale, a list of the putative Neat1 RNA target genes was characterized and analyzed in publicly available datasets, and a robust overlap of the gene list was found with circadian genes in the mouse pituitary and a closer overlap with post-transcriptional circadian genes in the mouse liver. Furthermore, on a few circadian genes common to either of these lists or both, a loss of rhythmic pattern was shown when paraspeckles were disrupted, assuming that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression. In conclusion, post-transcriptional circadian regulation plays a major role in determining oscillations at the mRNA level, and the new mechanism described suggests that circadian mRNA oscillations could be post-transcriptionally controlled through rhythmic nuclear retention by paraspeckle nuclear bodies.
The study reveals that Munc1
The shape and function of plant cells are interconnected, with complex cell shapes providing strategies to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall. A striking example is the puzzle-shaped cells found in the epidermis of many plants, whose function has been unclear. This essay proposes that these intricate forms help reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis, preventing the formation of large isodiametric cells that would bulge under stress produced by turgor pressure during isotropic growth. Simulation models support this hypothesis, showing that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress could reproduce the development of epidermal cell shape. These results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis. Plant cells undergo significant changes in size and shape during growth and morphogenesis, with complex shapes like the jigsaw puzzle-shaped epidermal cells of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, called puzzle cells. While much is known about the molecular players involved in puzzle cell patterning, a mechanistic theory is lacking. This essay proposes a function for the puzzle shape, suggesting that it is an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces acting on turgid plant cells in the epidermis. Turgor pressure induces mechanical stress in the cell wall, and for a given turgor pressure, cell size and shape provide a good predictor of mechanical stress, with larger cells subject to more stress than smaller ones. Minimizing mechanical stress on epidermal cell walls is particularly important, as the epidermis limits organ growth and is under tension from internal tissues. The essay concludes that the puzzle cell shape reduces the forces the cell wall has to withstand, potentially lowering the amount of cellulose and other wall material required to maintain mechanical integrity of the cell wall.
The spliceosome, a complex machinery involved in RNA processing, consists of several subcomplexes including U1, U2, U4/U6, U5, and the Prp19-complex, as well as many transiently interacting splicing factors. Spliceosome assembly occurs in a stepwise manner at splice sites (SS) on pre-mRNA, with U1 binding to the 5'SS and U2 binding to the 3'SS/branch site to form pre-spliceosomes. These pre-spliceosomes can form via cross-intron or cross-exon interactions, and can transition from cross-exon to cross-intron pre-spliceosomes, each with distinct protein compositions. However, the mechanisms by which these cross-intron and cross-exon pre-spliceosomes work together to facilitate pre-mRNA splicing are unclear. In human nuclear extracts, single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes were examined to investigate the dynamic mechanism of cross-intron and cross-exon cooperation in human pre-spliceosome assembly. The findings suggest that U1 bound to the 5'SS of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5'SS of the next intron to increase the rate and efficiency of U2 recruitment to the upstream intron, with distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5'SS across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.
A novel folding assistance system for membrane proteins has been discovered, operating from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This system involves ubiquitination of a specific lysine in LRP6, a Wnt signaling coreceptor, keeping it in the ER while avoiding degradation. Subsequent ER exit requires the removal of ubiquitin from this lysine by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19. This ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle is similar to the glucosylation-deglucosylation cycle occurring in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle. Folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and ER export, while unsuccessfully folded proteins are targeted to degradation through polyubiquitination. This ubiquitin-dependent folding system also controls the proteostasis of other membrane proteins, including CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor 2. Membrane protein folding is often inefficient and sensitive to errors or mutations, leading to diseases. For instance, the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells, has less than 25% of newly synthesized CFTR molecules actually reaching the plasma membrane. Mutations affecting the kinetics or thermodynamics of CFTR folding in the ER are recognized by ER quality control systems and targeted for degradation, leading to Cystic Fibrosis. Inefficiency in folding is a common characteristic of transmembrane proteins, which are synthesized by ER-bound ribosomes and co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane. Folding must proceed in three topological environments: the ER lumen, the membrane, and the cytosol, with the assistance of chaperones and folding enzymes. Failure in folding or assembly results in ER-associated degradation (ERAD).
"The article discusses the role of sex-based modulation of cognitive processes in neuropsychiatric disorders vulnerability. While value-based decision-making processes have been suggested to be influenced by sex differences, overall correct performance in decision-making tasks often shows minimal differences across sexes. However, computational tools can uncover latent variables defining different decision-making approaches. A study of mice in a two-armed bandit task found similar accuracy in male and female mice, but different exploration patterns. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices and got ""stuck"" in exploration, while female mice explored less but learned more quickly during exploration. These results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision-making during learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration is altered in various neuropsychiatric disorders, making the neural mechanisms of exploration a highly translational avenue for understanding sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Nearly every neuropsychiatric condition shows sex and/or gender biases in risk, presentation, etiology, and prognosis. Sex-modulated biological mechanisms could thus modulate cognitive processes that confer vulnerability and/or resilience to mental health challenges. However, sex differences in cognitive task performance can be difficult to detect, and an underrecognized source of variability in cognitive tasks is the existence of multiple ways to achieve the same level of performance on primary dependent variables. This means that equivalent levels of performance could mask individual differences in how males and females are solving the same problem. Therefore, examining the latent strategies underlying task performance might reveal that individual males and females can take very different strategic paths to learning action-outcome associations."
In the ER quality control pathway called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), misfolded, unassembled, and mistargeted proteins are removed from the ER and degraded by the proteasome. This process is crucial for protein homeostasis, and its malfunction can lead to ER stress and human diseases. Membrane proteins are extracted from the ER membrane by the cytosolic ATPase Cdc48, which pulls on polyubiquitinated substrates. However, how hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments move from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytosol, often together with hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts, is not well understood. A recent study using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 facilitates membrane protein extraction. A substrate's TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then moves into the aqueous phase, while luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action. This study reveals how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction, providing insights into the mechanism of ERAD.
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is crucial for development and tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Dysregulation of Hh protein production, distribution, and responses can cause various developmental defects and cancers. The Hh pathway involves a complex set of protein interactions, and understanding the molecular mechanisms of Hh communication is essential for combating Hh-related disorders. While many conserved Hh components have mammalian orthologs, there are differences between Drosophila and mammalian Hh signal transduction. Thus, investigating the fundamental molecular mechanisms in Drosophila, which is well-suited for precise and detailed genetic tests under physiological conditions, is important.In Drosophila, Hh alters the interactions among a set of core signaling components to elicit the transcriptional induction and de-repression of Hh target genes through Cubitus Interruptus (Ci), the singular transcription factor of the pathway. Hh can act as a morphogen that signals through Ci to transcribe different Hh target gene products depending on how much ligand is present at the cell membrane. In third instar larval Drosophila wing discs, Hh is expressed in posterior compartment cells, and Ci is expressed only in anterior cells. Hh signals to a band of anterior cells at the anterior-posterior (AP) border with declining strength from posterior to anterior. Within this AP border territory, Ci induces decapentaplegic (dpp) in a broad region, patched (ptc or a ptc-lacZ transcriptional reporter) in a gradient within a narrower domain, and engrailed (en) only in the cells closest to the source of Hh.Hh controls Ci activity by regulating the processing, activation, and degradation of full-length Ci (known as Ci-155). In the absence of Hh, the ligand-free receptor, Patched (Ptc), actively inhibits the actions of another transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), which is present under these conditions at relatively low levels and mainly associated with internal vesicles. Costal2 (Cos2), a kinesin-family protein, acts as a scaffold to bring Protein Kinase A (PKA), Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3), and Casein Kinase-1 (CK1) to C-155 and facilitate phosphorylation of Ci-155 at a series of clustered PKA, CK1, and GSK3 sites. This creates a binding site for Slimb, the substrate recognition component of a Cul1-SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes Ci-155 ubiquitination and subsequent partial proteolysis ('processing') by the proteasome to a repressor form (Ci-75).In summary, Hh signaling involves a complex set of protein interactions that ultimately lead to the transcriptional induction and de-repression of Hh target genes through Cubitus Interruptus (Ci) in Drosophila. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Hh communication is essential for combating Hh-related disorders. While many conserved Hh components have mammalian orthologs, differences between Drosophila and mammalian Hh signal transduction necessitate investigating the fundamental molecular mechanisms in Drosophila, which is well-suited for precise and detailed genetic tests under physiological conditions.
The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is a critical region for sensory processing, including nociception or pain perception. A study used an optogenetic approach to understand how dysfunction in this area can lead to pathological pain. The researchers selectively activated spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR) and found that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling. They directly relay signals to lamina I projection neurons and, when photoactivated in vivo, result in nocifensive behavior that is morphine sensitive, conditioned place aversion, and enhanced by spared nerve injury. Inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. These findings suggest that dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a future analgesic target. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying pain perception and opens new avenues for the development of targeted therapies for chronic pain.
In this study, Rab23-deficient mice were generated to understand the role of RAB23 in skull development, as mutations in the gene encoding RAB23 cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. The mice exhibited premature fusion of multiple sutures due to aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling was found to be elevated in Rab23-/- sutures, leading to an imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling, and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling normalized osteoprogenitor proliferation and reduced osteogenic gene expression, preventing craniosynostosis. These results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and in the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2. RAB23 is a member of the RAB family of small GTPases and is involved in embryogenesis, including heart and limb patterning, neural tube closure, and skeletal development. Multiple mutations in RAB23 have been reported in patients with Carpenter syndrome, a multi-organ developmental disorder with polysyndactyly, congenital heart defects, mental retardation, obesity, and craniosynostosis as central features. Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of one or more craniofacial sutures, resulting in major disruption of face and skull growth. Suture biogenesis is dependent on the correct patterning of the skeletal elements and the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell niche, osteogenic condensation formation, osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation. FGFRs isoforms show a distinct FGF ligand binding affinity and biological functions, and studies have shown that in an Apert syndrome (FGFR2 mutation) mouse model, isoform FGFR2c loses ligand specificity and is able to bind with cognate FGF10. Genetic knockdown of Fgf10 in this mouse model could rescue the premature fusion. FGF and Hh signaling have well-defined roles during intramembranous osteogenesis, and RAB23 regulates GLI1 in a Su (Fu)-dependent manner. GLI1-positive cells have been identified in the suture as the main source of mesenchymal stem cells that play a crucial role in suture patency. Therefore, RAB23 may coordinate the initiation of osteogenesis through the regulation of both FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1, and the additional regulation of GLI1 by pERK1/2.
The inheritance of gene expression states is crucial for cells to remember past events, such as environmental or developmental cues, and is maintained by the conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in animals and plants. PRC2 modifies chromatin at its targets and can be inherited through cell division. However, it is unclear whether this inheritance is in the form of cis memory, where one copy of a gene is repressed while the other is active and this state is inherited through many cell divisions, or trans memory, where local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors. A study monitoring the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in the same plants found that one copy can be repressed while the other is active, and this 'mixed' expression state is inherited through many cell divisions. This evidence supports the idea that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored in cis. Epigenetic memory can be stored in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors or locally in the chromatin environment, and the debate over whether heritable information can be stored in patterns of histone modifications is ongoing. The key transcriptional regulator PRC2, which catalyses methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 and is necessary for PRC2-mediated repression, plays a central role in this debate. Studies have provided valuable information about how a Polycomb system could store the memory of transcriptional states of individual genes in cis, but to definitively demonstrate that memory is stored in cis, it is necessary to show that two copies of the same DNA sequence can be independently maintained in different transcriptional states in the same nucleus. This has been observed in genomic imprinting and in random X-chromosome inactivation, but it remains an open question whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can store epigenetic memory.
DnaK/Hsp70 chaperones, including the endoplasmic reticulum Hsp70 BiP, can form oligomers of unclear structure and functional significance. Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking studies have shown that these oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, attenuating the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. The formation of BiP oligomers is rapidly modulated by the burden of unfolded proteins and ER calcium depletion, and is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale. In eukaryotes, the ER processes the majority of newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion and membrane insertion, and the maturation of ER client proteins entails the chaperone-assisted folding of nascent chains and assembly of functional complexes. Protein folding homeostasis in the ER requires a match between the complement of chaperones and the burden of nascent chains. The conventional unfolded protein response (UPR) involves transcriptional regulation of ER chaperone-encoding genes and signal transduction pathways that couple unfolded protein stress to gene expression. However, the inherent latency of this transcriptional program has favored the evolution of additional strands to the UPR, including rapid attenuation of protein synthesis and post-translational adaptations such as the reversible ADP ribosylation and de-ribosylation of the ER Hsp70 chaperone, BiP. In its ADP ribosylated form, BiP is locked into an inactive state with low affinity for its substrates, which can be drawn upon in time of need and inter-converted to the unmodified active form to increase the capacity of the ER to cope with enhanced unfolded protein burden whilst minimizing the cost of over-chaperoning.
Flexible filamentous viruses, which include economically important plant pathogens, have viral particles containing several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein (CP) protecting a (+) ssRNA. A study used electron cryomicroscopy to determine the structure of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a representative of the Potexvirus family, at 3.9 Å resolution. The results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus genus, a group of enveloped (-) ssRNA viruses. The main difference is in their C-terminal extensions, which determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies. The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and (-) ssRNA viruses. The study also found a clear structural homology between the CP of flexuous viruses and the NP of the genus Phlebovirus, suggesting a horizontal gene transfer event between these evolutionary distant groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses.
A new method, SiteLoc, for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular surface proteins has been developed, achieving nanometer-scale resolution in one dimension through localization relative to a reference surface. This method is designed to handle cellular surface morphology variation and antibody binding heterogeneity, overcoming challenges in traditional particle-averaging strategies. SiteLoc is suitable for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and can be applied to other molecular distance estimations. The location of protein binding sites on cellular surfaces has significant implications for various cellular processes and immunity. Antibody binding to pathogen surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity, and epitope localization affects diverse immunological outcomes. Traditional techniques for epitope identification are costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. SiteLoc offers a fast and efficient alternative for epitope location screening, contributing to the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.
The regulation of systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is influenced by peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds, with a key example being the relationship between hypoxic response in individual tissues and systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation. A study using mice found that hypoxic response via HIF transcription factors in the skin's large vascular bed influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia, affecting heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. Mammalian skin is complex and varies in different mammalian orders, playing a key role in responding to environmental variations and oxygen supply. The skin has an extensive vasculature that responds to shifts in oxygen availability, with keratinocytes releasing nitric oxide to increase blood flow in low oxygen conditions. A localized tissue response to hypoxia in the skin can affect the cardiovascular system, with systemic hypoxia inducing a tri-modal response of initial tachycardia and hypertensive phase, followed by an immediate and profound drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and finally recovery to a normoxic state. This response is influenced by peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin, demonstrating that peripheral tissues can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia.
Researchers have refined optogenetic methods for mapping neural circuits, enabling precise measurement of functional synaptic connectivity at the single-neuron level. By expanding the two-photon beam in the imaging plane using temporal focusing and restricting channelrhodopsin to the soma and proximal dendrites, they can reliably evoke action potentials in individual neurons, verify spike generation, and determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. The ability to accurately map circuit connectivity is critical for understanding sensory input and behavioral response patterns, and this improved optogenetic approach provides a significant step towards achieving this goal, offering enhanced spatial and temporal resolution for mapping neuronal circuits.
The mode of interaction of transcription factors (TFs) on eukaryotic genomes remains debated, with single-molecule data for Sox2 and Oct4 interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA. However, a rigorous biophysical analysis of these data suggests that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, where the expression of one decreases the other's genomic binding. This reciprocity can arise from energy expenditure or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. This implies unexpected complexity in how TFs interact on DNA, and single-molecule methods provide novel detection capabilities. Previous work by Chen et al. (2014) analyzed the dynamics of Sox2 and Oct4 in living cells to determine how these TFs found their cognate sites on DNA, concluding a preferred order of assembly with Sox2 binding first. However, this work misinterpreted the quantity R, which determines the ‘cycle condition’ for the model, not the probability ratio of the two binding pathways. This error implies the presence of energy-expending mechanisms maintaining the system away from thermodynamic equilibrium, which is significant for understanding eukaryotic gene regulation. Physics provides fundamental insight into the significance of energy expenditure, as it sets a limit on the error rate that cannot be reduced without energy-expending mechanisms. Therefore, revisiting the assumptions and calculations of Chen et al. (2014) is necessary to understand further the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on the genome.
Drosophila melanogaster can detect bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through a gustatory pathway, as demonstrated by flies' strong aversive responses to LPS in feeding and egg-laying assays. These responses are mediated by gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors and the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1. LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. These findings suggest a conserved molecular mechanism of pathogen detection between flies and humans. The ability to detect and respond to LPS allows Drosophila to avoid contaminated food and reduce the risk of infection, and this mechanism may be crucial for animal health as immune responses to pathogens come at a high metabolic cost.
The study identifies a mouse mutant, bloto, with a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp3
The assumption in gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances correlate with protein abundance, but this is often imperfect due to factors such as codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. A new global factor, mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, has been identified, increasing translational efficiency and demonstrating a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. These interactions have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. The study shows that taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance, and that it should be possible to predict protein abundance from genomic data, although protein and mRNA levels are not strongly correlated. Overall, this research provides insight into more precise modulation of protein abundance, impacting bioengineering and quantification of protein levels.
A study using in vivo imaging over a three-month period in SOD1G37R mice, a model of ALS, found that denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) occurs asynchronously in single motor units (MUs). Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, indicating a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons. Additionally, axonal branches are dismantled accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting, leading to synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. These findings suggest that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration. Early NMJ denervation has been observed in ALS patients and animal models, but it is unclear whether it is due to local branch-specific degeneration or a manifestation of a diseased and globally degenerating motor neuron. This study provides evidence for the former, indicating that local synaptic events have a limited impact on the denervation process. Despite this, local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation, as the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation. Local alterations of synaptic function and molecular signaling take place very early at the NMJ in ALS, implying that local, MU-independent, structural changes could occur. ALS is a non-cell autonomous disease, with cell types other than motor neurons contributing to the disease pathogenesis. Contribution of various cell types known to interact with NMJs and motor axons has been suggested, which could contribute to NMJ loss. The precise sequence of events taking place at the NMJ in ALS remains ill-defined, but understanding this sequence is of high importance for therapeutic purposes, as it could pinpoint the NMJ as an accessible target that can be exploited within a time window between the onset of structural changes and the global degeneration of the MU.
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been used for effective treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancers for over 40 years. It can decrease the incidence of breast cancer recurrence by up to 40% and is standard of care for people with hormone-responsive cancers. However, it is associated with various negative side effects, including hot flashes, endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolic events, bone loss, and fatigue, which markedly impact quality of life. These side effects have led to ~25% of eligible patients failing to start or complete this life-saving therapy due to side effects and safety concerns. Despite the significant impact of tamoxifen on breast cancer treatment and outcomes, the tissues and cells that mediate these negative side effects remain unclear.This study aimed to understand the multifaceted effects of tamoxifen therapy on physiology by investigating the cells and mechanisms that mediate the positive effects of tamoxifen from those that mediate the negative side effects. A particular focus was on the hypothalamus-preoptic area (hypothalamus-POA) within the brain, which is highly enriched for estrogen receptor expression and represents an anatomical candidate for mediating many of the side effects of tamoxifen therapy in humans.The study used mice treated with tamoxifen for 28 days, based on human dosage, and analyzed genome-wide expression changes of individual cells in the hypothalamus-POA using Drop-seq, a droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing technology. The findings indicated that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health. Specifically, tamoxifen shifts mouse temperature balance toward increased heat dissipation and decreased heat production, consistent with observations in humans experiencing hot flashes. Additionally, tamoxifen treatment was associated with greater bone volume ratios in the femur, increased cortical thickness, and a moderate decrease in 24-hour movement, indicating that chronic tamoxifen treatment increases bone mass and reduces physical activity.Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicates that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice. These findings suggest that targeting ERα signaling in the central nervous system may help mitigate adverse side effects of tamoxifen therapy and improve patient quality of life.
ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated, linear di-ubiquitin-like protein with anti-viral activity, but its role during bacterial infections has been unclear. A study found that ISG1
DeepFRET is an open-source software that uses a deep convolutional neural network (DNN) to analyze single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data. It is designed to automate the analysis of smFRET data, which is a powerful method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the analysis of smFRET data is time-consuming and requires expertise. DeepFRET aims to simplify and standardize the analysis process, making it more accessible to researchers. The DNN in DeepFRET is pre-trained on a large dataset of simulated traces, allowing it to classify traces into six categories: bleached, static smFRET, dynamic smFRET, aggregate, noisy, and scrambled. It then calculates a 'DeepFRET score' for each trace, representing the model's confidence that the trace is truly smFRET. The user can set a threshold for the DeepFRET score to accept or reject traces for further analysis. DeepFRET has been shown to outperform human operators in classifying smFRET data and has the potential to contribute to the benchmarking of smFRET for dynamic structural biology. The precise and rapid operation of DeepFRET demonstrates its capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of biomolecules.
"The study in question focuses on the role of SCML2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML2 is associated with Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and is involved in the localization of PRC1 and the repression of certain Polycomb target genes. The SPM domain of SCML2 allows it to bind to PRC1, while a novel RNA-binding region (RBR) enables it to interact with non-coding RNAs. The MBT domains of SCML2 also play a role in its targeting to chromatin.Polycomb group (PcG) genes are key regulators of gene expression in Drosophila, mammals, and plants. PcG mutants fail to maintain the repression of differentiation genes during development, leading to defects in embryonic patterning and homeotic transformations. Most PcG genes encode proteins that recognize or modify chromatin structure, often forming multi-subunit complexes such as PRC1. One such protein is SCM, which is required for appropriate body patterning during embryonic development in Drosophila. SCM belongs to a small family of proteins characterized by the presence of a conserved malignant brain tumor domain (MBT), which functions as a binding module for methylated lysines on histones.Despite the importance of PcG proteins in gene regulation, a coherent model explaining how these proteins are recruited and regulate different target genes in different cell lineages is lacking. In Drosophila, arrays of DNA motifs recognized by a variety of transcription factors function as recruitment ""hubs"" for PRCs and are known as Polycomb responsive elements (PREs). However, PREs alone are not sufficient to explain or predict the genome-wide occupancy patterns of PcG complexes. In mammals, the understanding of PRC targeting is even more limited, given that only a few examples of PRE-like DNA elements have been described and several of the transcription factors that bind and recruit Drosophila PRCs are absent or poorly conserved.The study found that the RBR of SCML2 exhibited little specificity for RNA sequence but discriminated between RNA and DNA in vitro and strongly preferred single-stranded to double-stranded RNA. The RBR shifted both HOTAIR RNA and DNA, but only HOTAIR RNA and not DNA competed efficiently for binding to the RBR. The RBR displayed an affinity for nucleosome particles, but much lower than for RNA, and was capable of forming a ternary complex with nucleosomes and RNA simultaneously.The study also found that the human SCML2 locus gives rise to two alternative isoforms, SCML2A and SCML2B. SCML2A has a domain organization similar to that of Drosophila SCM and is enriched in the chromatin fraction, while SCML2B is predominantly nuclear but lacks the SPM domain and is found in the soluble nuclear fraction. SCML2A is the isoform more likely to have a direct function on chromatin and transcription. An SCML2A mutant lacking the RBR was displaced from chromatin, showing that interactions between RNA and the RBR may contribute to the recruitment of SCML2 to chromatin. Overall, the study highlights the role of SCML2 in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases such as medulloblastoma."
In gene expression control, regulation of translating ribosomes is crucial, with Escherichia coli's SecM-mediated translation stalling controlling the SecA-dependent secretion pathway. Previous studies showed that SecM peptide and ribosome exit tunnel residues significantly contribute to stalling, but the atomic-level molecular mechanism remained unclear. Two cryo-EM structures of SecM-stalled ribosomes revealed two distinct stalling mechanisms during elongation cycle steps. One involves inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), inhibiting peptide bond formation with incoming prolyl-tRNA. The other mechanism shows prolonged peptidyl-RNA residence at the hybrid A/P site, inhibiting full-scale tRNA translocation. This regulation demonstrates continuous, dynamic reshaping of the ribosome functional center, with protein synthesis modulated by various ribosome-interacting factors and nascent peptides throughout all kingdoms of life. Nascent peptides, like SecM, can regulate translation through interactions with the peptide exit channel on the 50S subunit, impacting the PTC and conformation. In Escherichia coli, SecM-mediated stalling upregulates SecA synthesis, providing a feedback loop for sufficient SecA levels regulating protein secretion. This feedback loop allows for ribosome stalling induced by SecM, or secretion pathway impairment, to effectively respond to secretion challenges in the cell.
A study using a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) measured foveal cone density in relation to axial length in living eyes, finding that despite retinal stretching in longer eyes, myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes. This contradicts the expectation that increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression would result in poorer visual acuity. However, more detailed studies are needed to determine the structural changes at the foveal center during myopic progression. The AOSLO system used in this study offers high-resolution images of the photoreceptor mosaic in vivo, enabling a more precise analysis of the cone density at the fovea as a function of eye length.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a significant cause of invasive disease in infants, particularly in low-income settings. The duration of asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but the variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. A study combined longitudinal swab data and whole genome sequence data to estimate that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, while host traits accounted for less than 5%. The heritability was partitioned into both lineage and locus effects, and the largest sources of variation in carriage duration were identified as serotype, drug-resistance, and other significant locus effects. A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance. The average nasopharyngeal duration period is affected by a large number of factors, including host immune defense, other bacterial species, and other pneumococcal lineages. The carriage duration by different serotypes is widely used in models of pneumococcal epidemiology, and consequently is important in evaluating the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. By combining epidemiological modelling of longitudinal swab data with genome wide association study methods, heritability estimates for carriage duration were made and the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration were identified and quantified.
The cardiac repolarization is regulated in part by the slow delayed rectifier current (IKs), which is conducted by the tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel KCNQ1 and its β-subunit KCNE1. The stoichiometry of the α and β-subunits in the IKs complex has been a subject of controversy, with studies reporting a strict 2:4 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. A recent study used IKs fusion proteins to investigate the stoichiometry, and found that EQQ and EQQQQ (2:4 and 1:4 stoichiometries, respectively) had increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ. These effects were abolished by the addition of KCNE1. The study also found that there is no intrinsic mechanism limiting the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex. KCNQ1 is widely expressed throughout the body, and when paired with KCNE1, it has unique properties in several tissues, particularly the myocardium and inner ear. In the heart, KCNQ1 and KCNE1 together conduct the IKs, which is primarily responsible for stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration at high heart rates. Inherited mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE1 result in life-threatening arrhythmogenic syndromes such as long QT (LQT) types 1 and 5, short QT type 2 or familial atrial fibrillation. Additionally, mutations in KCNQ1 and KCNE1 have been linked with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, an inherited form of LQT syndrome accompanied by deafness. KCNQ1 and KCNE1 complexes have also been found in the proximal tubule of the kidney, where they participate in secretory transduction. Despite the significant role of this ion channel complex in health and disease, the stoichiometry of the binding between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 remains controversial. Studies have reported a ratio of two β-subunits to every four α-subunits, while others suggest a more flexible stoichiometry with anywhere from one to four β-subunits associating per KCNQ1 tetramer depending on their concentration. However, recent studies using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to count β-subunits by single molecule photo-bleaching reached opposing conclusions, adding to the controversy.
The regeneration of tissues and organs is crucial in regenerative medicine, and the zebrafish is a powerful model organism for studying regeneration mechanisms due to its high regenerative capacity. Zebrafish can regenerate complex structures such as fins, heart, brain, retina, and other tissues. The caudal fin of zebrafish, in particular, has been used as a model for analyzing epimorphic regeneration, a type of regeneration in the urodele limb and fish fin. During epimorphic regeneration, two characteristic tissues, the wound epidermis and the blastema, are induced in response to tissue amputation, and their coordinated actions regulate cell proliferation and morphogenesis, leading to tissue regeneration.Myeloid cells are widely recognized to play a role in protection against pathogens and microorganisms after tissue injury. However, recent studies have shown that myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration. A study found that in the zebrafish mutant clo, a pro-inflammatory cytokine gene, interleukin 1 beta (il1b), is aberrantly upregulated, causing apoptosis of regenerative cells. The study further found that epidermal cells surrounding the amputated tissue are the source of il1b in both wild-type (WT) and clo larvae, and its expression is usually quenched by the action of macrophages. A lack of this anti-inflammatory effect of the macrophages results in apoptosis. Additionally, il1b signaling plays an indispensable role in normal tissue regeneration by activating the expression of regeneration-induced genes. Therefore, a proper level of il1b expression and the inflammatory response, which are tuned by macrophages, are necessary for progression of tissue regeneration.In summary, proper levels of il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration. The zebrafish is a powerful model organism for investigating regeneration mechanisms because of its high regenerative capacity. Proper levels of il1b expression and the inflammatory response are necessary for tissue regeneration, and macrophages play a crucial role in this process. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for advancements in regenerative medicine.
In this study, the molecular motion in the cytoplasm and its limitation on the pace of processes was investigated. The research analyzed the dependence of protein mobility on protein surface properties and ionic strength, using surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Haloferax volcanii. The results showed that protein mobility depends on the net charge and its distribution over the protein, with positive proteins diffusing slower than negative ones in E. coli. This effect was weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The study found that the decrease in mobility is caused by the interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes, indicating that ribosome surface properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. The finding highlights a paradox in the functioning of prokaryotic (endo) symbionts as the very processes that are limited by diffusion also depend on it. The transient macromolecular interactions in vivo, resulting from molecular evolution, are referred to as the quinary structure of proteins, discriminated from the more generic nonspecific interactions that occur between molecules without coevolved interfaces. The study examined the diffusion coefficients of proteins as a function of their surface properties to probe the boundary conditions for the generic nonspecific interactions with the aim of understanding the quinary structure of proteins. The findings provide insight into the role of protein surface properties in shaping protein diffusion and have implications for understanding the dynamics of protein interactions within cells.
Planarian regeneration, the ability of planarian worms to regrow missing body parts, is a complex process that involves distinct molecular responses to wounds. A study focused on a follistatin homolog in planarians, Smed-follistatin, found that it is required for regeneration in response to significant tissue absence. Inhibition of Smed-follistatin blocks responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. The wound-induced expression of Smed-follistatin and its role in inhibiting Smed-Activin proteins suggest that it is critical for the initiation of regeneration following injuries involving tissue absence. This mechanism is important for understanding the central mechanisms that drive regeneration, which is widespread in nature and relevant to many species, including humans.
In a study, researchers used whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to analyze the mutational landscape of MMR-deficient tumors, which are characterized by a distinct mutation signature and microsatellite instability (MSI). The researchers found that MMR-deficient tumors have a unique mutation profile, similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a significant fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations that escape MMR. They also identified a large set of recurrent indels that can be used to detect MSI. Furthermore, the study found that these tumors are characterized by a reduced DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination pathway, making them sensitive to double-strand break inducers. MMR-deficiency is a well-established cause of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of cancer susceptibility triggered by loss-of-function mutations in MMR genes. Lynch syndrome is responsible for 2-5% of endometrial or colorectal tumors, and MMR-deficient tumors exhibit different prognosis and therapeutic outcome after standard chemotherapy. These tumors are resistant to standard chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy and cisplatin or carboplatin, as well as targeted therapies. Efforts to individualize the treatment of MMR-deficient tumors have focused on identifying synthetic lethal interactions within the MMR pathway, such as increased oxidative damage or interference with the base excision repair pathway. However, these findings have not yet translated into clinically effective treatment options. More comprehensive studies of the mutation spectra arising in MMR-deficient tumors are needed to interpret their clinical relevance with respect to diagnostically assessing MSI and therapeutically targeting MMR-deficient tumors. The study sequenced another comprehensive set of MMR-deficient tumors using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing and found that these tumors exhibited a clear hypermutator phenotype, with a high number of novel somatic mutations. These results provide a more comprehensive picture of the mutation spectra of MMR-deficient tumors and highlight the distinct mutational landscape of these tumors.
The use of light-inducible dimerization protein modules allows for precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive manner. One such module is Magnets, which are small protein modules engineered from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid. Magnets are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners and require simultaneous photoactivation for interaction, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28°C to be functional. To overcome these limitations, an optimized Magnets pair (eMags) was engineered that requires neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. eMags have been validated and used in various applications including protein recruitment to different organelles, generation/expansion of organelle contact sites, and the rapid and reversible reconstitution of VAP-dependent inter-organelle tethers. These enhanced Magnets (eMags) are effective tools for optogenetically manipulating physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.
Ribosome stalling during translation has been found to cause neurodegeneration, but the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are unknown. A study analyzed the brain of mice with stalled elongation complexes due to deficiencies in a tRNAArgUCU tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. Increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ser51) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these mice. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, which was found to be activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in a tRNA-independent fashion. The ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, highlighting the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress. Overall, this research provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and the role of the ISR in neuroprotection.
The height of individuals has been associated with various factors such as longevity, education, earnings, and health. A reanalysis of 1,472 population-based studies with over 18.6 million participants revealed that the largest gains in adult height over the past century occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm taller, respectively. Meanwhile, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, while the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896. Despite changes in the ranking of countries, the height differential between the tallest and shortest populations has remained the same for women and increased for men. Taller individuals are generally associated with enhanced longevity, lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and higher risk of some cancers. Additionally, taller people tend to have higher education, earnings, and social position, although height is a highly heritable trait, cross-population differences are believed to be related to non-genetic, environmental factors. Foetal growth, maternal size, nutrition, and environmental exposures during childhood and adolescence are particularly important determinants of height during adulthood. Height trends can help understand the health impacts of childhood and adolescent nutrition and environment and their social, economic, and political determinants on both non-communicable diseases and neonatal health and survival in the next generation.
The rate of opioid overdoses in the US has quadrupled between 1999 and 2017, with over 130 deaths per day, making it a significant public health crisis. Opioids cause respiratory depression, which is a leading cause of overdose deaths. A recent study in mice found that the brainstem's breathing circuitry is critical for opioid-induced respiratory depression, with the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) being the key site. Only 70-140 neurons in this region are responsible for its sensitivity to opioids. Future research characterizing these neurons may lead to novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while preserving analgesia.Breathing in mice, like in humans, is severely depressed by opioids, and this response is eliminated in mice without the µ-Opioid receptor (Oprm1). Oprm1 is widely expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites that could modulate breathing, such as the cerebral cortex, brainstem respiratory control centers, primary motor neurons, solitary nucleus, and oxygen sensing afferents. However, it is unclear which of these sites are necessary and sufficient to induce opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). To address this, a recent study conducted a detailed quantitative analysis of OIRD in awake animals and identified two key changes to the breath that drive the depressive effects of opioids. These two metrics, a prolonged inspiratory time and a distinct pause phase, define OIRD and can serve as a rubric for others.Opioids cause only two primary changes to the breath, namely, decreased inspiratory airflow and addition of a pause phase that delays initiation of subsequent breaths. These two parameters can both be controlled by the breathing central pattern generator, the preBötC, in the brainstem. Localized injection of opioids into the preBötC results in respiratory depression, and localized naloxone reverses decreased breathing after administration of systemic opioids. However, such experiments fail to distinguish between the action of opioids on presynaptic terminals of distant neurons projecting into the preBötC versus direct action on preBötC neurons themselves. To overcome this, a recent study genetically eliminated the µ-Opioid receptor (Oprm1) from preBötC cells exclusively, sparing projecting inputs, by injecting adeno-associated virus constitutively expressing Cre (AAV-Cre-GFP) into the preBötC of Oprm1 flox/flox (Oprm1f/f) adult mice. Injection site specificity was confirmed by the restricted expression of Cre-GFP, and subsequent Oprm1 deletion was inferred. The study found that deletion of Oprm1 in the preBötC did not affect breathing observed after saline injection. However, breathing was markedly less depressed by morphine administration compared to the intact control state: breaths were twice as fast, the peak inspiratory flow was larger, and pauses were nearly eliminated.In summary, this study identifies the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) in the brainstem as the critical brain site for opioid-induced respiratory depression, with only 70-140 neurons responsible for its sensitivity to opioids. These findings can lead to novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while preserving analgesia, which is crucial for addressing the opioid overdose epidemic.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections are major health problems, with over 2 billion people infected worldwide and 350 million chronically infected, resulting in 1 million deaths per year. The pre-S1 domain of the L protein in the envelope proteins of both viruses is crucial for entry into host cells, but the receptor(s) involved are unknown. In this study, the researchers used a photoreactive peptide ligand derived from the pre-S1 domain and identified sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter mainly expressed in the liver, as the functional receptor for both HBV and HDV. This finding provides important insights into the entry mechanism of HBV and HDV and may aid in the development of therapeutics for these infections.
Sepsis, a dysregulated systemic inflammatory response to infection, results in a substantial global health and economic burden, with a high mortality rate. While early intervention has improved survival during the cytokine storm, those that survive can enter a state of chronic immunoparalysis, characterized by transient lymphopenia and functional deficits of surviving cells. Memory CD8 T cells are crucial for long-term immunity, and CD8 T cell impairment due to sepsis can predispose individuals to re-infection. A study found that central memory CD8 T cells from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals, and this increased proliferation leads to changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment and altered tissue localization. These sepsis-induced changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape culminate in altered T cell intrinsic changes and reduced capacity to control L. monocytogenes infection. Therefore, sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function and localization, potentially changing host capacity to respond to re-infection.
The APOBEC3 (A3) gene family, particularly APOBEC3A (A3A), plays a crucial role in regulating Long INterspersed Element-1 (L1) retrotransposition in human genomes, a process that can otherwise pose a mutagenic threat. A3A, a cytidine deaminase, is known to inhibit L1 retrotransposition, but the exact mechanism by which it does so remained unclear. Researchers have now discovered that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration.L1 elements, which make up roughly 17% of human genomic DNA, can significantly contribute to intra- and inter-individual genetic variation and, on occasion, disrupt gene function, leading to sporadic genetic diseases. Active human L1s are approximately 6 kb in length and contain a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), and a 3′ UTR that terminates in a poly (A) tail. Both ORF1p and ORF2p are required for efficient L1 retrotransposition, which occurs by a mechanism called target-site primed reverse transcription (TPRT).The study of L1 retrotransposition events in the presence of A3A did not yield evidence of deamination, making it difficult to understand the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition. However, new evidence from in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrates that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. This finding elucidates a long-standing question in the field and provides a mechanistic explanation for the inhibitory effects of A3A on L1 retrotransposition.In summary, A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration, offering a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating L1 retrotransposition in human genomes. Understanding these mechanisms can help us uncover new therapeutic strategies to mitigate the mutagenic potential of active L1s and prevent or treat associated genetic diseases.
Rem2 is an activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase that plays a crucial role in visual circuit plasticity and regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in response to changing sensory experience. Rem2-/- mice fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance (OD) plasticity during the critical period, with a cell-autonomous role in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons before changes in synaptic function. In the absence of Rem2, both in vitro and in vivo recordings reveal increased spontaneous firing rates. Rem2 mRNA expression in V1 is modulated by visual stimulation coincident with experience-dependent development of visual cortical circuits, and its expression peaks in the cortex around the time of eye opening and declines near the end of the critical period. Rem2 functions to regulate visual system plasticity in vivo, and Rem2 deletion affects the experience-dependent increase in excitatory synapse density that occurs during the weeks after eye opening in visual cortex. Rem2 also plays a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation, with altered late-phase OD plasticity in Rem2-/- mice. Additionally, Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling.
This analysis focuses on the impact of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells, inspired by reports about magnetism in biological systems. Qin et al. (2016) claim to have found a protein complex that guides magnetic orientation in animals, while Stanley et al. (2015) and Wheeler et al. (2016) report magnetic control of membrane conductance using ferritin. However, these claims are inconsistent with fundamental physics, with discrepancies up to 10 log units. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.Magnetic fields interact weakly with biological matter, but evolution has developed special mechanisms for magnetic field sensing, such as in magnetotactic bacteria. These bacteria use magnetite crystals to align with magnetic fields and navigate. Magnetosensation in animals might involve a similar mechanism, with a magnetite mechanism coupling movement of a magnetic crystal to a membrane channel, or through a 'radical pair mechanism' affecting biochemical reactions.Qin et al. (2016) propose a new idea, with a single macromolecule acting as a magnetic receptor protein in fruit flies. Wheeler et al. (2016) attempt to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane using a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel (TRPV4) with ferritin. However, these methods likely involve unrealistic assumptions and lack the necessary magnetic forces or torques for the desired effects.In conclusion, the proposed biophysical mechanisms and biotechnological applications for magnetic field sensing and control lack a solid foundation and require new discoveries or alternate explanations due to the weak interaction between magnetic fields and biological matter.
Stem cells, including those in the brain, can exist in different states: self-renewing, differentiating, or entering a state of quiescence. A study of neural progenitors in fruit flies (neuroblasts) has provided new insight into the process of quiescence. The study found that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, they transiently express low levels of the differentiation factor Prospero, which is followed by the establishment of a unique molecular profile that lacks most progenitor and differentiation markers. This pulse of Prospero is necessary for the entry into quiescence, as loss of Prospero prevents it and a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. Quiescent stem cells are important for preserving the stem cell pool for activation following disease or injury, and understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell quiescence may help design clinical approaches to prevent tumor dormancy and cancer recurrence, as well as to aid in activating stem cells for tissue repair. Drosophila neuroblasts have served as a model system for identifying conserved signaling pathways that regulate stem cell proliferation and quiescence.
The uncoating of the metastable HIV-1 capsid, a crucial step in the HIV-1 replication cycle, has been studied through the development of a single-particle fluorescence microscopy method. This method follows the real-time uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV capsids in vitro after permeabilizing the viral membrane. The rate-limiting step of uncoating is the opening of the first defect in the lattice, followed by rapid, catastrophic collapse. The capsid-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates capsid opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice, while a polyanion delays initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. These observations suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently, with the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators likely determining the overall uncoating kinetics. The HIV capsid is a protective shell around the viral genomic material, playing a key role in protecting the viral genome from degradation and facilitating reverse transcription, engaging with the nuclear pore complex, and directing integration site targeting. The uncoating process and its influencing factors are key unanswered questions in HIV biology. The HIV capsid is a challenging entity to study due to its high polymorphism and poor fidelity of assembly. Current biochemical methods used to study HIV capsid stability include in vitro uncoating assays, fate of capsid assays, and cyclosporin A washout assays, which measure uncoating in bulk and rely on observing the average behavior of large numbers of viral cores. The fluorescence microscopy methods that track the uncoating process in fixed or live cells can resolve steps in the uncoating process of individual capsids in the cytoplasm but lack high throughput measurements and detailed kinetic studies under defined conditions. The in vitro single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay described here allows for the observation of the uncoating kinetics of hundreds of individual HIV capsids in a single experiment, classifying virions into three categories based on their uncoating behavior and defining two discrete uncoating events. This versatile method enables both 'bottom-up' approaches to determine the effect of individual host molecules and drugs and 'top-down' studies in which the influence of whole-cell lysates can be observed.
"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and its development is associated with both inherited and sporadic mutations. While some mutations are well-established ""driver"" mutations that promote tumor development, others are ""passenger"" mutations with no functional impact on the tumor. A study examining the role of the JNK pathway, a frequently mutated pathway in breast cancer, found that loss-of-function mutations in this pathway are actually ""driver"" mutations that promote breast cancer development. Specifically, loss of JNK signaling in mammary epithelial cells caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer, and JNK deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. These effects were due to a requirement of JNK to prevent tumor initiation, rather than a role in the growth of established tumors. Overall, this study highlights the importance of further research into the role of the JNK pathway and other frequently mutated pathways in breast cancer development."
Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is an enzyme required for generating amidated bioactive signaling peptides, and it has been identified in Chlamydomonas and mammalian cilia. PAM is required for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamydomonas, planaria, and mice. In Chlamydomonas, PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone and had abnormal Golgi architecture and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Decreased PAM gene expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface of planaria and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. The architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in Pam-/- mouse embryos was also aberrant. These findings suggest that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to the observed ciliogenesis defects and provide an unanticipated, highly conserved link between PAM, amidation and ciliary assembly. The biogenesis and maintenance of cilia is a tightly regulated cell type specific event, and disruption of ciliogenesis or ciliary function leads to ciliopathies, a group of multisystemic diseases that have partially overlapping, often severe phenotypes. Proteins and complexes involved in polarized vesicular trafficking such as the clathrin adaptor protein-1 complex (AP1), Rabs, and Arf/Arl proteins, the exocyst, and BBS complexes are critical for cilium biogenesis. PAM, a secretory pathway-localized enzyme, catalyzes one of the final steps in the biosynthesis of many signaling peptides. The striking evolutionary co-occurrence of organisms containing PAM-like genes and cilia prompted researchers to explore PAM localization in C. reinhardtii and found that this enzyme is present in the Golgi and cilia. PAM was also observed in motile and primary cilia of mammalian cells. In C. reinhardtii cilia, PAM activity displayed an unexpected, strong biochemical association with the axonemal superstructure. These observations suggest that PAM has a novel and highly conserved signaling or sensory function in eukaryotic cilia. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of PAM in ciliogenesis and its potential role as a therapeutic target for ciliopathies.
Class III myosins, specifically Myo3, and actin-bundling protein Espin play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. Mutations in these genes can lead to hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its THDI motif, but the specific mechanism was unclear. Recent studies have discovered that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences that can independently and strongly bind to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing a Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 elucidate the binding mechanism and reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1. Myo3, along with class IX myosins, are two special groups of the myosin superfamily, known to express in vertebrate retina and cochlea, playing partially redundant roles as transporters. The kinase domain of Myo3 regulates the motor’s ATPase activity. The tail regions of Myo3 from different species are less conserved, with Drosophila NinaC containing a PDZ binding motif at its very C-terminus and vertebrate Myo3 tails sharing a conserved vertebrate specific domain referred to as tail homology I motif (THDI). The THDI mediates binding of Myo3 to its cargo protein Espin1, allowing Myo3 to transport Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures such as filopodia and stereocilia. Espin1 promotes the elongation of actin protrusions, and Myo3 binding can release the auto-inhibition and increase the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles. Myo3a/Myo3b are known to co-localize with Espin1 at the tips of stereocilia of hair cells, and co-expression of Myo3a and Espin1 can further stimulate elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti hair cells. Mutations of human Myo3a gene can cause progressive non-syndromic hearing loss, and transgenic mice with DFNB30 mutation undergo age-dependent outer hair cell degeneration. Mutations in espin were also associated with non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness DFNB36 and non-syndromic autosomal dominant deafness. A prominent phenotype of the jerker mice, which carry espin frame-shift mutation, is that their hair cell stereocilia are uniformly thinner and shorter, likely by promoting the assembly and stabilization of parallel actin filament bundles in stereocilia.
Voltage-gated calcium channels, such as CaV1.1, play crucial roles in excitable cells like neurons and muscles by controlling functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. These channels have different voltage-dependent activation and kinetic properties, which are determined by the structures and transitions of their voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). Two VSDs of CaV1.1, VSD I and VSD IV, have been studied using computational modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology. The structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of these VSDs have been analyzed. Both VSDs show the typical features of the sliding helix model, but they differ in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. The stabilization of the activated state enhances the voltage dependence of activation, while the stabilization of resting states slows down the kinetics. This mechanism provides a basis for understanding how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.
The adult brain's ability to undergo plastic changes is crucial in medicine, particularly for recovery from injuries or improving cognition and learning. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are associated with juvenile visual cortex plasticity, but their role in adult plasticity is not well understood. In this study, mice were treated with an MMP-inhibitor to determine its effect on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected mice. In healthy animals, MMP-inhibition prevented visual plasticity, while in mice that had a stroke, treatment with the MMP-inhibitor once, but not twice, following the stroke rescued plasticity. This suggests an optimal level of MMP-activity is necessary for adult visual plasticity. Neuroplasticity is essential for tissue repair and neural network rewiring in the clinical setting. The primary visual cortex (V1) is a commonly used model region for studying sensory plasticity. Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity can be modified by depriving one eye of pattern vision for several days. In this study, 7-day monocular deprivation (MD) in adult mice resulted in an ocular dominance shift towards the open eye, while MMP-inhibition during the MD period prevented this shift. These results indicate MMPs play a crucial role in adult visual plasticity.
AMPA receptors, which are found at excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain, play a crucial role in fast excitatory transmission. These receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that consist of three layers, including the two extracellular layers that assemble from amino-terminal domains and ligand-binding domains. The extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can undergo large conformational changes rapidly, which could disrupt possible interactions of the extracellular domains with the pre- and postsynaptic anchoring proteins. This conformational dynamics of the receptor domains and their relation to synapse dimensions has implications in both health and disease. Recent advances in the structural biology of ionotropic glutamate receptors have produced a catalogue of static conformational snapshots, including several agonist-bound structures that suggest local dimers in the ATD and LBD layer move apart from each other substantially, resulting in an 'open' extracellular layer. A team of researchers used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers of defined lengths to measure the separation of domains in this work, revealing that the more opened-up a given conformation of the extracellular layer of the receptor is, the slower it is to access. However, auxiliary subunits restrict the conformational ensemble, maintaining more compact arrangements of the LBD layer without much separation of the two LBD dimers. The rupture of the LBD intra-dimer interface is a structural hallmark of AMPA receptor desensitization. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length receptors suggest that desensitization might involve further rearrangements of the ligand-binding domains, including movement of the two LBD dimers away from the central twofold axis of symmetry and an even more substantial 'opening' of the ATD-layer parallel to the membrane plane. The researchers used bis-MTS cross-linkers ranging from 7 to 18 Å in length to probe the movements of the LBD layer and found that the more opened-up a given conformation of the extracellular layer of the receptor is, the slower it is to access. Once attained, these conformations are stable. Auxiliary subunits restrict the conformational ensemble, maintaining more compact arrangements of the LBD layer without much separation of the two LBD dimers. These findings suggest that AMPA receptors at synapses probably have similar, compact geometries regardless of their instantaneous gating state.
A research team has developed a new protocol for isolating single cells from the intestines of mice infected with helminths, a type of parasitic worm. The new protocol involves optimizing the standard intestinal digestion protocol, including modified EDTA wash steps, testing various collagenases, and increasing and modifying wash steps. The new protocol resulted in a high cell yield from heavily infected intestines, allowing for the analysis of anti-parasite immune responses. The team validated their findings using high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The new protocol has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses, contributing to the understanding of diseases and infections related to the intestine.
The proteasome is a crucial protein complex in cellular processes, including metabolism and immunity, and its activity is regulated by various factors. A study used an integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The results suggest that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of substrates into the proteasome, with variations in transport efficiency between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes impacting total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage. The study highlights the importance of time-resolved data and mathematical modelling in understanding molecular mechanisms and designing better experiments. The findings have implications for various cellular processes and medical conditions, including stress responses, cell signalling, and immune responses. The research provides a basis for future studies on the main active forms of proteasome in cells and the role of proteasomes in protein degradation and disease.
In Drosophila, histamine recycling is essential for visual synaptic transmission, and a new β-alanine transporter, BalaT, has been identified as being required for this process. Histamine is quickly removed from the synaptic cleft by laminar glial cells and conjugated to β-alanine by an N-β-alanyl-dopamine synthase, called Ebony, to form the inactive metabolite carcinine. A carcinine transporter, CarT, retrieves carcinine directly from the laminar synaptic cleft, but it was unclear how β-alanine was returned to the laminar glial cells. BalaT is expressed in retinal pigment cells and is responsible for transporting β-alanine into cells. Mutations in the balat gene disrupt photoreceptor synaptic transmission, phototaxis behaviors, and the retinal distribution of β-alanine. BalaT expression in retinal pigment cells completely rescues the defective visual transmission of balat mutants. Therefore, a novel β-alanine recycling pathway has been identified, in which β-alanine that is released from photoreceptor cells is taken up and stored by retinal pigment cells, and then delivered to laminar glia via gap junctions, where histamine is inactivated by conjugation with β-alanine.
In this study, researchers report the discovery of a redox collapse in chronologically aging yeast cells, affecting over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. This collapse is caused by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH levels, which provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, rather than an increase in endogenous oxidants. The drop in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that down-regulates most cellular processes. The study also reveals a timeline of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death. This redox collapse is associated with the oxidation of a subset of conserved proteins, including NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase, a key enzyme in maintaining redox homeostasis. Caloric restriction, a near-universal measure to extend lifespan, increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade. The study provides new insights into the role of oxidants in lifespan and aging and highlights the importance of NADPH in maintaining redox homeostasis.
In the study of the homochiral biological macromolecular world, effective enforcement and perpetuation of this homochirality is crucial for cell survival. A configuration-specific enzyme was discovered that selectively removes D-amino acids (D-aas) erroneously coupled to tRNAs. This enzyme, D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), uses an invariant ‘cross-subunit’ Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral center of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. DTD's unique mode of substrate recognition provides a clear explanation for its ability to act on multiple D-aas, while the strict chiral specificity ensures that the enriched cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. This study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus. The selection of only L-amino acids for incorporation in proteins necessitates effective enforcement and perpetuation of homochirality, which is ensured by multiple checkpoints, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, elongation factor Tu, ribosome, and DTD. DTD removes D-aas mischarged on tRNAs and ensures that D-aas do not get incorporated into proteins. DTDs act in trans as freestanding modules, operating through resampling by recapturing aminoacyl-tRNAs from EF-Tu. A DTD-like fold has been found appended to archaeal threonyl-tRNA synthetase, suggesting its probable role in enforcement of homochirality during early evolution of translational machinery. DTD activity is essential in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with high levels of expression in human neuronal cells, which are abundant in D-aas. DTD specifically acts on multiple D-aa-tRNAs while rejecting L-aminoacyl-tRNAs without any specificity for either the amino acid or the tRNA. This mechanistic basis of this fundamental process remained elusive due to lack of a cognate substrate-bound structure until the first crystal structure of DTD from Escherichia coli was solved in the apo form. Later, the apo structures of DTD from Haemophilus influenzae, Aquifex aeolicus, and H. sapiens also became available. However, the structural basis of DTD’s strict enantioselectivity was not clear until the structure of Plasmodium falciparum DTD was solved in complex with ADP and multiple free D-aas. This study reports the mechanism of this crucial process with the help of high resolution structures of PfDTD in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog, providing a better understanding of the essential role of a universally conserved ‘cross-subunit’ Gly-cisPro motif in providing exclusive enantioselectivity to the enzyme and ensuring homochirality during translation.
The CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) is a chloride ion channel belonging to the ABC (ATP Binding Cassette) protein superfamily. It is activated by phosphorylation of its cytosolic regulatory domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, followed by ATP-driven gating. The ion pore within the TMDs (Transmembrane Domains) opens upon formation of a tight head-to-tail NBD (Nucleotide Binding Domains) dimer stabilized by two ATP molecules at the dimer interface. Pore closure accompanies NBD dimer disruption prompted by ATP hydrolysis at the composite interfacial site. Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but in certain CF mutants constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. These spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP, indicating that ATP alters the stability but not the fundamental structural architecture of open- and closed-pore conformations. This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms. Wild-type CFTR channels open occasionally even in the absence of ATP, and the frequency of these spontaneous openings is increased by certain mutations in the third intracellular loop and at the cytosolic end of pore-lining TM helix 6, allowing for quantitative biophysical studies of spontaneous gating.
A study presents a mechanism for a powerful force of assembly and mobility for transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, referred to as the 'orderphobic effect'. This phenomenon is a pre-transition effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. The orderphobic effect is mediated by proximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. It is shown to be significantly larger in strength and range than forces arising from membrane elasticity. The membrane model used in the study exhibits an ordered phase and a disordered phase, with the ordered phase having regular tail packing and larger hydrophobic thickness than the disordered phase. The transition between the two phases is shown to be a first-order transition, with a finite interfacial stiffness. The orderphobic effect is leveraged by the power of a phase transition and depends on the ability of the orderphobic protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. The strength and range of the orderphobic force increase with proximity to the membrane’s phase transition and the protein’s radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane.
Fluorescent calcium indicators, particularly genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), are widely used to investigate neural dynamics in vivo, including action potentials (APs). However, the relationship between fluorescence and APs remains unclear, particularly in population imaging studies where fewer photons are collected per neuron. A study examining 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f found that while most APs were detected under optimal conditions, under more realistic imaging conditions, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected (typically under 10% and ~20-30%, respectively). This highlights the limits of AP detection in population imaging studies.Neuropil contamination, where fluorescence from the surrounding neuropil is included in the somatic fluorescence, can affect AP detection. Subtracting a scaled version of the neuropil fluorescence from the somatic fluorescence can help, but the scale factor (r value) must be carefully chosen to avoid false positives or negatives. The study found that the value of r had a modest effect on event detection in GCaMP6f neurons in mouse V1.Event detection in calcium imaging is affected by several factors, including the field of view, spatiotemporal resolution, and spike inference models. Imaging a large field of view limits the dwell time per soma and signal-to-noise ratio, reducing event detection rates. The study found that most 1 AP events were detected in GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f neurons, but with lower average probability in GCaMP6f neurons. 2 AP events were reliably detected in all four mouse lines. In high spatial and temporal resolution images, it was possible to detect most but not all 1 AP and 2 AP events with a false positive probability of only 1%. However, 1 AP detection probabilities were lower than in previously reported neurons with virally expressed GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f. Downsampling images in space and time to mimic imaging with a larger field of view reduced event detection probabilities.Three spike inference algorithms were deployed to estimate the number of APs in each image of the movie. All three algorithms estimated AP numbers that approximately recapitulated the number of APs measured with electrophysiology, but the number of APs per frame was typically not an integer due to imperfect spike inference. Performance differed greatly between neurons but was similar across inference algorithms and mouse lines and differed little between high-resolution and downsampled images. However, detection probability was commonly <0.1 for 1 AP events, increasing approximately linearly with AP number, often to ~0.8 for 5 AP events. With 1 AP events being the most common event type in all four mouse lines, it was possible to detect only a minority of events with a low false positive probability. Using these spike inference algorithms, event detection was severely impaired by a reduction in spatial and temporal resolution to mimic a typical two-photon population imaging experiment. In a typical two-photon population imaging experiment, no electrophysiology recording is available to optimize event detection, and the shape of the calcium transient is estimated from published indicator rise and decay times or derived from a representative sample of fluorescence transients. Under these sub-optimal conditions, performance was degraded equally for high and for low resolution images. The results suggest that there is ample room for improvement of spike inference models since event detection by the three spike inference models falls far short of the performance of the ground truth-optimized approach.
The Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla has a functional switching valve within its female genitalia, composed of sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ for anchoring males and obtaining semen, which is packed in a capsule used for both fertilization and nutrition. The valve complex has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla females to continuously mate while receiving seminal gifts. This mechanism may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. The design and construction of these mechanisms on a micrometer scale are challenging for engineers, making studies of such biological structures rewarding for discovering potential engineering solutions.
SNARE proteins are crucial for neurotransmitter release in neuronal communication, and their function involves a complex series of folding and assembly stages. A study using optical tweezers to observe these stages found four distinct phases in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains. The NTD and CTD were responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, while the MD regulated SNARE assembly and fusion. The SM-protein Munc18-1 was found to initiate SNARE assembly, structure the t-SNARE C-terminus, and stabilize the half-zippered SNARE complex. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between SNARE domains and Munc18-1 in neurotransmitter release.
The integrin adhesome, a complex of over a hundred proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion, is capable of assembling and disassembling rapidly and accurately at diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites. This process is facilitated by the pre-assembly of integrin adhesome components into multi-protein building blocks in the cytosol. These building blocks are uniformly exchanged between the cytosol and stationary focal adhesions, preserving their specifications and ensuring the correct assembly of adhesion sites. The self-assembly of adhesion sites involves the recruitment of these multi-protein modules, and the symmetric exchange of building blocks maintains the specifications of these modules in the cytosolic pool. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) have been used to demonstrate the existence of these multi-protein building blocks in the cytosol and their exchange with stationary focal adhesions. The data shows that a substantial number of adhesion site components are physically associated in the cytosol, indicating that the assembly of adhesion sites is carried out by the recruitment of pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks rather than individual proteins. The symmetric exchange of these building blocks ensures the specifications of these modules and the correct assembly of adhesion sites.
Deep non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and general anesthesia with propofol are reduced arousal states associated with synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). While rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also linked to diminished arousal, it is characterized by a desynchronized, 'wake-like' EEG. A study using intracranial and surface EEG recordings across four datasets found that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, differentiates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM, and REM sleep. Importantly, the spectral slope distinguishes wakefulness from REM sleep based solely on neurophysiological brain state. These findings suggest a common electrophysiological marker for reduced arousal states, including different sleep stages and anesthesia in humans.
Dynamic tubular extensions from chloroplasts, called stromules, have been shown to play a role in plant innate immunity. These structures extend along microtubules (MTs) and their dynamics are affected by MT organization, with stabilization of MTs increasing stromule numbers and length. Actin filaments (AFs) are not required for stromule extension but provide anchor points for stromules. Chloroplast movement is strongly correlated with stromule direction and is facilitated by MTs and AFs during innate immunity. A model is proposed where stromules extend along MTs and connect to AF anchor points surrounding nuclei, guiding chloroplasts to the nucleus during an immune response. Stromules are developmentally regulated and can increase the surface area of chloroplasts, facilitating transport of signals or macromolecules to various cellular locations. They have been shown to play a role in innate immunity by making connections with the nuclei to facilitate transport of chloroplast-localized defense proteins and pro-defense molecules into nuclei during an immune response. The mechanisms responsible for stromule connections to nuclei and eventual perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts are unknown. Stromule length and motility are regulated by cytoskeleton elements such as AFs and MTs, with AFs and MTs affecting stromule frequency, length, and motility. Stromules move along AFs using myosin motors, but direct evidence for movement along AFs is lacking.
In the field of structural biology, understanding protein-protein interactions is crucial as they are involved in many cellular processes. A study by Ovchinnikov et al. (2014) explored the possibility of using residue-residue covariation across protein-protein interfaces to predict contacts and assemble models of biological complexes. The researchers used a pseudo-likelihood-based method to identify residue pairs that covary across interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes. They found that these covarying residue pairs are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins.This method was then used to predict subunit contacts for an additional 36 protein complexes with unknown structures and models were presented for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter. The researchers also demonstrated that this approach could be used to predict if two proteins interact with each other.Previous studies on monomeric proteins have shown that coevolution-based contact prediction using global statistical models is accurate. However, there is limited knowledge about the utility of such statistical models in predicting protein-protein interactions. The study by Ovchinnikov et al. (2014) addresses this gap by examining residue-residue covariance across protein-protein interfaces using a pseudo-likelihood-based statistical method. The researchers found that covarying positions are almost always in contact in the three-dimensional structure, and significant residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs.In conclusion, the study by Ovchinnikov et al.

In a study focusing on a pattern categorization task, participants showed an active sensing strategy that improved categorization performance. This task required multiple fixations to extract information from different locations, unlike visual search tasks with a single location having necessary information. The study used gaze-contingent images, revealing small apertures at each fixation location while tracking eye movements. Participants' scan paths followed an active sensing strategy, with optimized fixation locations for categorization, and were around 70% efficient. This active sensor algorithm, combined with a Bayesian ideal observer, showed that a portion of the apparent suboptimality of fixation locations came from prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. The central process of selecting fixation locations aimed to maximize information about abstract categories requiring the integration of information from multiple locations. Overall, the results suggest that humans select eye movements to efficiently extract task-relevant information, with an active sensing strategy in visual categorization tasks.
Nucleocytoplasmic transport is a crucial process in eukaryotic cells, regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). While thousands of molecules pass through the NPC, large cargoes like pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes can cross intact. A study investigating the nuclear import of 30 large cargo models, based on four capsid-like particles, revealed that a simple two-parameter biophysical model can recapitulate the requirements for their nuclear import. The model correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC.The NPC, a large macromolecular complex, serves as the gatekeeper for nucleocytoplasmic transport and restricts access to cargoes larger than 40 kDa. However, cargoes presenting a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and binding nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) can rapidly enter the nucleus. NPCs allow a diversity of cargo sizes to pass through, from nuclear proteins and viral import to nuclear export of pre-ribosomal subunits and mRNA complexes.The transport of large cargoes is still poorly understood. To address this, researchers designed a set of large model cargoes based on capsid-derived structures. This allowed them to titrate key features such as size, number of binding sites, and surface properties. By using a combination of spectroscopy and semi-automated microscopy assays, the kinetics of nuclear import were investigated for cargoes with diameters between 17 and 36 nm and varying numbers of NLSs.The study found that nuclear import kinetics depend on both size and NLS number for large cargoes, highlighting the importance of understanding transport mechanisms for large particles.
A study was conducted to determine the role of CD28, a co-stimulatory molecule essential for T cell activation, in maintaining T cell responses following activation. Researchers generated a strain of mice where CD28 was removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. The study found that maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract. This demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming. CD28 is crucial for T cell activation, proliferation, survival, glucose metabolism, and migration. CD28-deficient mice have reduced expansion of effector CD4+ T cells and do not form T helper type 1 (Th1) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells after infection or immunization. Th1 cells are formed during a Type 1 immune response and facilitate the clearance of intracellular pathogens. Impaired formation of Tfh and Th1 cells results in impaired cellular and humoral immunity to foreign antigens in CD28-deficient mice. Despite the central role of CD28 signaling in T cell biology, a role for sustained CD28 expression in CD4+ T cell subset differentiation and maintenance has not been described. This is likely due to the difficulty in determining the role for CD28 after T cell priming, as CD28-deficient helper T cells do not become activated, and thus cannot be used to evaluate the role for CD28 after T cell priming. The CD28 pathway is an area of considerable research interest as it can be manipulated by a number of therapeutics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disease, prevent transplant rejection, expand anti-tumor T cells and regulatory T cells. Understanding its biology is of direct clinical relevance. Studies have suggested that CD28 may play a role following T cell priming, but attributing these phenotypes to a role for continued CD28 expression in established immune responses is not possible because CD28 signaling is blocked on all cells and not only on previously activated T cells. To determine whether there is a role for CD28 signaling after T cell activation, researchers generated a strain of Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice where CD28 expression is lost after T cell priming. They found that the numbers of both Tfh and Th1 cells are reduced in Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice after influenza A virus infection, although, surprisingly, the requirement for CD28 on each cell type is distinct. Tfh differentiation requires CD28 ligation during interactions of primed T cells with B cells, and fully differentiated Tfh cells require CD28 expression for their survival. By contrast, Th1 cells do not require CD28 for their maintenance, but do for their expansion following T cell activation. Furthermore, Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice are unable to clear Citrobacter rodentium from their gastrointestinal tract following oral infection, demonstrating that CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for intact effector CD4+ T cell responses during infection.
The helical shape of Helicobacter pylori is crucial for efficient stomach colonization, and the cell wall's peptidoglycan (PG) structure determines this shape. PG is a polymer of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid with an attached peptide stem that can be crosslinked to a peptide stem of an adjacent PG strand. The crosslinked PG strands form the cell wall, a large mesh-like macromolecule that surrounds the cell and counteracts the cell’s turgor pressure. The PG monomer is synthesized in the cytoplasm and subsequently flipped across the inner membrane and incorporated into the existing PG by the glycosyltransferase activities of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and shape, elongation, division, and sporulation (SEDS) proteins and the transpeptidation activities of PBPs. Helical cell shape maintenance in H. pylori requires a suite of both PG-modifying enzymes and non-enzymatic proteins that may act as scaffolds or play other structural roles. One of the non-enzymatic proteins is the putative bactofilin CcmA, which is shown to co-purify with Csd5 and the PG biosynthetic enzyme MurF, suggesting CcmA may influence cell wall growth. A study using superresolution microscopy and 3D quantitative image analysis showed that synthesis is enhanced at negative Gaussian curvature as well as at a limited range of positive Gaussian curvatures. The cytoskeletal proteins MreB and CcmA are enriched at negative and positive Gaussian curvatures, respectively, and both MreB and CcmA help maintain PG synthesis activity locally. Thus, PG synthesis patterning is one mechanism that plays a fundamental role in helical cell shape maintenance.
Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Specifically, Cdc48 integrates the activities of DUBs (deubiquitylases) Ubp12 and Ubp2, which have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1. Cdc48 promotes Ubp12-mediated proteolysis, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1, while loss of Ubp12 leads to the accumulation of Ubp2 and inhibition of fusion. Overall, Cdc48's regulation of the ubiquitylation status of Fzo1 allows for the control of the balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion, revealing a new cascade of ubiquitylation events. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo constant fusion and fission, regulated by post-translational modifiers including ubiquitin. Ubiquitin plays a dual role in mitochondrial fusion, and its effects on mitochondrial fusion are regulated by Cdc48 through a new enzymatic cascade involving Ubp12 and Ubp2. Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which in turn negatively regulates Ubp2, explaining their opposing effects on ubiquitin homeostasis. Cdc48's role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology is attributed to its regulation of Fzo1 and ubiquitylation, which promotes mitochondrial fusion events. Cdc48 physically interacts with Fzo1, specifically recognizing pro-fusion ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1, and regulates Fzo1 stability. Ubp12, a deubiquitylase, interacts with Cdc48 and is modified by ubiquitin, and its levels are regulated by Cdc48 in a proteasome-dependent manner. Deletion of UBP12 in cdc48-2 cells rescues mitochondrial tubulation, demonstrating that Cdc48 regulates mitochondrial morphology via Ubp12. Cdc48 maintains Fzo1 ubiquitylation and activates mitochondrial fusion by downregulating Ubp12, and while there is evidence that Cdc48 directly recognizes ubiquitylated Fzo1, there are likely other functions for Cdc48 in this pathway. Overall, Cdc48 plays a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and ubiquitylation, affecting Fzo1 ubiquitylation levels and mitochondrial tubulation via Ubp12.
The study examines the categorical organization of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) in response to acoustic stimuli in sighted and early blind individuals, and visual stimuli in sighted individuals. The research found that VOTC encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind individuals, with a more reliable representation in the blind group. The VOTC of the blind represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. Additionally, the study explores the mechanisms of brain reorganization in sensory-deprived individuals and the role of intrinsic biological constraints in shaping the functional organization of the brain. The research suggests that in absence of visual experience, the functional organization of the occipital cortex may not develop according to its visual proto-organization and may switch its functional tuning toward distant computations. Overall, the study highlights the complex interaction between sensory experience and intrinsic biological constraints in shaping the functional organization of the brain.
A newly discovered strain of the fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae infects wild Drosophila and manipulates the host's behavior before it dies. The fungus invades the nervous system directly, causing the host to climb upward, extend its proboscis, affix in place, and raise its wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from its abdomen. This behavior is induced by specific sets of metabolites that the fungus secretes in response to being grown with ex vivo dissected brains from its natural hosts. The E. muscae-Drosophila system provides a new opportunity to study the molecular basis of behavioral manipulation, which has been difficult to study due to the lack of established genetic tools in either the fungus or the host and neurobiological tools in the host.
RNA degradation pathways play a crucial role in RNA processing, regulation of RNA levels, and surveillance of aberrant or poorly functional RNAs in cells. A study in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified the transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors. The profiles revealed the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes, consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, while decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, indicating rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs. The abundance of eukaryotic RNA species controls cell type and cell fate and is determined by the balance between RNA synthesis and RNA degradation. Multiple mechanisms exist for RNA degradation, and RNAs are generally exported to the cytoplasm, where they are degraded with an RNA-specific rate. Surveillance occurs both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and aberrant RNAs are quickly degraded. RNA degradation kinetics need to be actively regulated to ensure the optimal life time for each transcript. RNA degradation can occur from both ends of a transcript, and these processes are often coupled. During canonical mRNA turnover, degradation is thought to be initiated by shortening of the 3´ poly-adenylated (polyA) tail through two major deadenylation complexes. Specific mRNAs can recruit selected deadenylating factors after loss of the polyadenylate-binding protein that protects the mRNA from degradation on the 3′ end, but the choice of deadenylation pathway remains unclear.
"In eukaryotes, the regulation of gene induction involves changing chromatin states at target genes and recruiting the transcriptional machinery, including transcription factors. Camalexin, a potent defense compound in Arabidopsis thaliana, can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. While several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been identified, how the rapid activation of genes in this pathway upon a pathogen signal is enabled remains unclear. A study combined publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping and found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression, H3K27me3 (repression) and H3K18ac (activation), to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin, which the researchers named ""kairostat."" This kairostat plays an important role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants. This discovery has implications for understanding how plants rapidly respond to stress and how epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli."
Epigenetic mechanisms allow certain astrocytes to maintain neurogenic competence throughout adulthood, and a key player in this process is the histone methyltransferase EZH2. In mice, this Polycomb repressive factor is expressed in astrocytes located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus, which serve as neurogenic NSCs for all of adult life. EZH2 is crucial for both cell proliferation and neuronal lineage specification in these NSCs. It directly represses the Ink4a/Arf locus to enable SVZ NSC self-renewal, and its absence leads to defective postnatal neuron production. In SVZ NSCs, EZH2 also directly targets Olig2, and repression of this bHLH transcription factor is required for neuronal differentiation. Additionally, EZH2 prevents the aberrant activation of transcriptional regulators that specify alternative neuronal lineages. In the human brain, EZH2 is also expressed in astroglia and neuronal precursors of the early infant SVZ, suggesting that this PRC2 factor plays key roles in postnatal human neurogenesis. Therefore, EZH2 is a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia, enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population.
In this study, researchers used single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in a model marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) to identify 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. The results suggest that approximately 1/3 of SUP05 bacteria is virally-infected, with higher infection frequency where oxygen-deficiency is most severe. The observed Microviridae clonality suggests the recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, while systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses posits previously unrecognized cooperation modes. The SUP05 viruses persisted for years, but remained endemic to the OMZ. The identification of virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase suggests SUP05 viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism. These findings demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus-host co-evolutionary dynamics with the potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs. This research combined metagenomic and single-cell genomic sequencing to explore virus-host interactions within uncultivated bacteria inhabiting a marine OMZ. Marine OMZs are oceanographic features that arise from elevated demand for respiratory oxygen in poorly ventilated, highly stratified waters, and are crucial for biogeochemical cycles in the global ocean. OMZs are expanding due to changing ocean water temperatures and circulation patterns, making a clearer understanding of biological responses critical to develop predictive modeling capacity for OMZs.
Cilia and flagella are hair-like microtubule-based organelles present in diverse organisms, performing crucial functions such as locomotion, fluid flow, and sensing extracellular signals. Defects in cilia structure or function cause various human diseases called ciliopathies. The assembly and maintenance of cilia depend on intraflagellar transport (IFT), an active transport process within cilia mediated by IFT particles. IFT particles consist of more than 20 proteins, separated biochemically into two subcomplexes, IFT complexes A and B. While IFT complex B contributes to anterograde IFT with kinesin, and IFT complex A contributes to retrograde IFT with dynein, the functions of individual IFT proteins are mostly unclear.TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and its knockdown in zebrafish embryos or mutation in C. reinhardtii produces short cilia with abnormal motility. However, IFT particle assembly and speed are normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. A particular set of proteins involved in motility is specifically depleted in the dyf13 mutant, suggesting that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets. This specific role of TTC26/DYF13 in transporting a subset of ciliary proteins is further supported by comparative proteomic analysis of the flagellar proteins in the dyf13 mutant. Thus, unlike many other IFT proteins, TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis nor for assembly or movement of the IFT particle per se but plays a specialized role in transporting a specific set of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella.
Lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis are associated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma. However, the mechanisms by which lymphatic dissemination contributes to distant metastasis are not fully understood. A study found that exposure of expansively growing human WM852 melanoma cells to lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in 3D co-culture facilitates melanoma distant organ metastasis in mice. The study also found that melanoma cells adopted an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix, dependent on MMP14, Notch3, and β1-integrin. MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation. MMP14 and Notch3 were required for LEC-mediated metastasis of zebrafish xenografts. These findings suggest that LEC contact promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasively sprouting cell phenotype. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment, including the ECM and cell-non-autonomous interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells, plays a vital role in metastasis. The lymphatic endothelium serves as a protective microenvironment for the survival of incipient metastatic cells and actively interacts with surrounding cells in the tissue, regulating both physiological and pathological processes including tumor progression and metastasis.
A team of researchers developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line to study the role of miR-9, a conserved noncoding RNA that functions as a posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression, in vivo. The miR-9 sponge mouse line allows for conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. The researchers found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo and its downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. Early neuronal development consists of a series of events including neurite extension, axonal polarization and growth, dendritic arborization, and synaptic formation. Dendrites are the primary site of information input into neurons, and the architecture of the dendritic tree and the targeting of dendrites into appropriate territories critically shape the input properties of neurons. Dendritic arborization and synaptic formation are multistep processes influenced by external signals and intrinsic genetic programs. Emerging data suggests that specific miRNAs exert critical regulatory functions during neuronal differentiation by controlling developmental gene expression programs driving dendritic and spine maturation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are particularly enriched in the nervous system where they have been shown to influence neuronal development and function. Importantly, miR-9 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the developing and adult brain. However, the function of miR-9 in differentiated neurons is largely unknown. This is surprising since miR-9 levels are higher in mature neurons than in neural precursors, suggesting that important biological processes beyond proliferation or specification are regulated by miR-9. A role for miR-9 in axonal extension and branching has been described, indicating the importance of miR-9 in the establishment of neuronal networks. However, the involvement of this microRNA in the later stages of neuronal development remains unexplored. In this study, the researchers aimed to characterize a potential role for miR-9 in dendritic and spine development in vivo. They employed miRNA sponges as a long-lasting miRNA inhibition strategy and found that miR-9, but not miR-9*, participates in the developmental programs controlling dendritic growth and that endogenous mir-9 levels have a saturating effect of on dendritic maturation.
Social visual engagement difficulties are early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and can be quantified using eye tracking methods. However, the link between these difficulties and atypical early functional brain organization in ASD is unclear. A study using resting state fMRI data in a large sample of ASD toddlers and other comparison groups found ASD-related functional hypoconnectivity between 'social brain' circuitry such as the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks. An ASD subtype with pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties, referred to as 'GeoPref ASD', is characterized by marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity. Increased DMN-OTC hypoconnectivity is also related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in GeoPref ASD. These findings suggest that early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells, which increase in numbers throughout larval development and are crucial for homeostasis through a division of labor. While mature plasmatocytes can proliferate, it is unclear if crystal cell numbers increase via self-renewal or de novo differentiation. A new study has found that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation in sessile clusters, which are necessary for this function. This hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems. Hemocytes, the blood cells of insects, have diverse functions including phagocytosis, extracellular matrix deposition, AMP production, encapsulation, and melanization, which are compartmentalized into different cell types. Hemocytes primarily proliferate and differentiate in hematopoietic organs, providing the correct cellular and molecular environment for the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. The larva possesses a hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, where plasmatocytes and crystal cells differentiate from prohemocytes. Hemocytes attached to the epidermis form stereotypical clusters, indicating that some signal must direct hemocytes to these locations, potentially influenced by peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons. Further characterization of crystal cell differentiation mechanisms is required to understand how its number increases during larval development, particularly since Notch signaling is necessary for crystal cell formation in a cell-autonomous manner. Notch activation is sufficient to induce the expression of lozenge, the first known transcription factor in crystal cell development, and hemocytes in clusters establish stable cell-cell contacts between them, with sessile hemocytes in clusters constituting the biggest compartment of hemocytes in the larva.
Aneuploidy, which refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, is linked to various diseases but also facilitates organismal evolution. However, how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve remains unclear. While laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. Gene-dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes in wild yeast, and genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. Aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to certain oak strain, such as YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution. This process was proposed by Ohno over 40 years ago and has been shown to provide a major force in the evolution of new gene functions. The genomic era has largely borne out this hypothesis, with many studies characterizing the outcomes of whole and partial genome amplification. The immediate consequence of duplication is assumed to be increased expression of the affected genes, and in some cases, the increased expression provides a selective advantage. Over longer periods, the relaxed constraint afforded by functional redundancy allows one or both gene copies to evolve, driving sub- and neo-functionalization, expression divergence, and network rewiring. Whole and partial chromosome amplification through aneuploidy is frequently observed in laboratory evolution studies and in drug-resistant fungal pathogens, suggesting that aneuploidy is a rapid route to phenotypic evolution. However, aneuploidy comes with a fitness cost, and the reasons for aneuploidy toxicity are not entirely clear but may be due to increased expression from genes that are toxic when overexpressed.
Xenopsin, a subtype of opsin, has challenged and expanded our understanding of opsin and photoreceptor evolution. Originally thought to be part of the Gαi-coupled ciliary opsins, xenopsins are now known to have diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilaterian times. Despite this, little is known about the cells that express these proteins or if they form a photopigment and drive phototransduction. A study on the flatworm Maritigrella crozieri found xenopsin expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes and in extraocular cells around the brain in adult worms. These extraocular cells contain hundreds of cilia within an intra-cellular vacuole, known as a phaosome. Functional assays in human cells show that Maritigrella xenopsin drives phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gαi. This finding highlights similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and reveals a novel type of opsin-expressing cell that encloses the ciliary membrane within their own plasma membrane, similar to jawed vertebrate rods.Light detection is crucial for most animals, and a diverse range of photosensitive cells has evolved. These cells can be classified as either ciliary photoreceptors (CPRs) or rhabdomeric (microvillar) photoreceptors (RPRs). When both types coexist in the same organism, one type typically dominates in the eyes while the other performs nonvisual functions in the eyes or is present as extraocular photoreceptors. Photopigments, which are responsible for light-dependent chemical reactions in these cells, are composed of opsin-class G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) coupled with a light-sensitive chromophore.The initial characterization of opsins in bilaterian animals identified several conserved opsin gene families, each associated with distinct photoreceptor cell types and specific downstream G-protein phototransduction cascades. However, recent accumulation of sequence data from a wide range of animals has revealed a far greater diversity of opsins and the discovery of many new and morphologically divergent photosensitive cell types, both ocular and extraocular. The recent identification of xenopsins is a leading example of this and is leading to a reevaluation of eye and photoreceptor cell type evolution. Xenopsins have been found in various lophotrochozoan phyla, including molluscs, rotifers, brachiopods, flatworms, and an annelid. They share a characteristic c-terminal sequence motif with some ciliary opsins and were originally classified as part of the c-opsins. However, recent phylogenies have shown xenopsins to be phylogenetically distinct from c-opsins, with xenopsins and c-opsins present in the last common ancestor of Bilateria.The presence of xenopsins in cells with elaborated ciliary surfaces and their association with pigmented cells suggests a role for xenopsins in photoreception. However, this function has not yet been definitively demonstrated. Additionally, if xenopsins do detect light, the subsequent phototransduction pathway remains unknown. Determining these factors and understanding the phylogenetic distribution of xenopsins and the cells in which they are expressed is essential for understanding the evolution of this opsin subtype and of the photoreceptors that use them. Flatworms, a diverse and biomedically important group of invertebrates, offer a promising avenue for studying xenopsins and their role in photoreception. The description of xenopsins in flatworms, along with the discovery of cells with elaborated ciliary membranes, suggests that CPRs may exist in flatworms. However, these cells have not been studied at the molecular level, and understanding their role in photoreception remains an open question.
Drosophila neuroblasts, or neural progenitors, are individually identifiable and have relevant spatial and temporal transcription factors, making them a good model for studying how spatial and temporal cues specify neuronal diversity. A study by Bergman et al. investigated whether these cues act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. They used Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts that make different progeny and found that Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. The Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in one neuroblast but not the other, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in the former but not the latter. These findings support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage. Spatial and temporal factors are integrated to generate lineage-specific neuronal diversity in Drosophila and likely in mammalian progenitor lineages. However, the mechanisms by which this integration occurs are unknown. The authors propose two possible scenarios: independent specification, where spatial and temporal transcription factors bind their genomic targets independently, and sequential specification, where early expression of STFs biases the subsequent DNA-binding profile of later expressed TTFs. The authors use the Hb DNA-binding protein to discriminate between these models and identify Hb occupancy within the early NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages during the Hb competence window. They find that Hb occupancy is different in each neuroblast, supporting the sequential specification model.
P2X receptors are ATP-gated ion channels with seven subtypes widely expressed in many cells, including neurons. They are trimeric ion channels that switch between closed and open conformations in response to extracellular ATP, allowing the flow of ions (sodium, potassium, and calcium) through the transmembrane pore and initiating signal transduction. ATP-gated P2X receptors are involved in various pathological disorders, including chronic and inflammatory pain. Recent X-ray structures of the zebrafish P2X4 receptor in its apo and ATP-bound states have provided a molecular understanding of how ATP binding triggers channel opening. However, the mechanism of gating at the transmembrane pore remains controversial. Researchers used photo-switchable cross-linkers as “molecular tweezers” to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. Their data revealed that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. The inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins. The findings are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the gating process and may open new therapeutic avenues for P2X-related pathological disorders.
Cytokinesis, the division of one cell into two, is a fundamental process in cell division and is powered by the constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. While it was previously assumed that all animal cells divide using a similar molecular mechanism, recent evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation varies between different cell types. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate and specific cytokinetic requirements. In one cell (P2), cytokinetic variation is regulated intrinsically, while in another cell (EMS), it is regulated extrinsically and depends on Src signaling and direct contact with the neighbor cell, P2. Both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types, protecting against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened. Cytokinesis failure can lead to human diseases including blood syndromes, neurological disorders, and cancer. The molecular mechanisms underlying cell-type-specific cytokinetic variation are poorly understood, but could be regulated by both cell-intrinsic factors (e.g. cell polarity and inherited proteins and RNAs) and cell-extrinsic factors (e.g. cell-fate signaling and cell-cell adhesions). The C. elegans four-cell embryo is a powerful system to study the mechanisms of cell-type-specific cytokinetic variation.
In a study of the role of bacterial flagella, it was found that the rotation of sheathed flagella in the bacteria Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio cholerae promotes the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an immunogenic molecule. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that the flagellar sheath allows bacteria to evade immune recognition. The study used the model symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid to observe the interactions between the symbiont and the host. The results showed that the sheathed flagellum plays a role in inducing a specific host immune response, independent of its later role in migration into the light-organ crypts. The study also found that flagellar rotation, and not just the expression of immunogenic flagellin, is necessary to activate apoptosis in the light organ. Additionally, the rotation of the sheathed flagellum may destabilize the sheath and release LPS, activating an LPS-dependent immune response. The findings have implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella and raise questions about sheathed-flagellum function.
Genome instability, associated with mitotic errors and cancer, can lead to both deleterious rearrangements and genetic novelty. A study of Arabidopsis plants with different centromere histones H3 found that hybridization resulted in extreme chromosomal restructuring, or shattering, formed from the genome of the haploid inducer. This was consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Breakpoint junctions indicated breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair. Mutation of required NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 resulted in enhanced haploid recovery, suggesting the potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a natural system for investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders. Nucleosomes containing variant histone (centromeric histone H3, CENH3) determine centromeres. In Arabidopsis thaliana, mitotic and meiotic functions can be complemented by chimeric CENH3 or CENH3 from diverged plant species, but crossing these strains to wild-type individuals results in frequent loss of the chromosomes marked by the variant CENH3. In nature, similar phenomena involve defective CENH3 loading, leading to mitotic catastrophe and consequences for genome integrity, including aneuploidy and extensive chromosomal restructuring. Chromosomal rearrangements are not necessarily deleterious and can influence fitness by altering recombination or gene dosage. Genome elimination in Arabidopsis provides a system for investigating genome instability during mitotic catastrophes and connected mechanisms, contributing to understanding the relationship between pathways leading to disease and diversity.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widespread human tumor virus associated with several cancers, including lymphomas and carcinomas. EBV infection can lead to malignancies due to the expression of viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis. A study led by Price et al. explored the mechanism of survival in EBV-infected B cells during early infection when LMP1, a key viral oncoprotein, is expressed at low levels. The researchers found that EBV utilizes a virus-mediated mechanism independent of LMP1 signaling to promote survival during early infection. Specifically, they discovered a dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms from uninfected B cells (BCL-2) to early-infected (MCL-1/BCL-2) and immortalized cells (BFL-1). This shift relies on the regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. This study highlights a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis and its implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.In summary, this research reinforces the significance of EBV-induced survival mechanisms in infected B cells, contributing to the development of EBV-associated malignancies. A better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for EBV-associated cancers.
Plants produce a variety of metabolites to cope with environmental challenges, which drive the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between plant species. However, the frequency and geographic distribution of new alleles controlling specialized metabolite diversity are not well understood. A study of 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions showed that geography, environmental parameters, demography, and genetics all contribute to the variation and distribution of specialized metabolites, or chemotypes, within the species. The study found frequent independently generated alleles at causal loci in specialized metabolism, suggesting potential within-species convergence. These findings provide a new perspective on the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation. The production and accumulation of metabolites, including signaling hormones, primary metabolites, and specialized metabolites, help determine a plant's survival and development. However, individual specialized metabolites can have contrasting effects on the plant, creating offsetting ecological benefits and costs. These opposing effects involve multiple selective pressures that contribute to shaping the genetic and metabolic variation within a species. Structural variation at the enzymes responsible for the chemical structures or variation in the expression levels of these enzymes contributes to the quantitative variation in specialized metabolism. These structural and regulatory variants and the resulting chemical variation strongly influence plant fitness in response to a broad range of biotic interactions.
"In a Drosophila tumor model, oncogenic Ras (RasV12) modifies caspases from tumor suppressors to tumor promoters, converting cells into an ""undead""-like state and promoting tumor growth. Instead of causing apoptosis, caspases now generate intra- and extracellular ROS, which recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells. These cells signal back to tumorous epithelial cells, creating a feedback amplification loop that promotes neoplastic activity. Both intra- and extracellular ROS are required for tumor growth, and reducing ROS suppresses tumor growth and improves survival rates. These findings highlight the significance of ROS in the neoplastic characteristics of scrib−/− RasV12 animals."
"The perception of social interactions through body gestures is an essential part of daily life and reflects one's social cognitive competency. A study found that the subjective duration of social interactions is perceived to be shorter than their physical duration, an effect that is negatively correlated with an individual's autistic-like tendency. Intranasal oxytocin administration restores this temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, while atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. This suggests that perceived time is highly idiosyncratic and influenced by one's personality traits. The structure of space-time is unaffected by mental time, but the neural energy involved in representing sensory inputs can ""warp"" subjective time. Social interaction is a crucial aspect of human life, and inter-individual variation in social proficiency has been associated with plasma concentrations of oxytocin and polymorphisms of its receptor gene OXTR. Intranasally administered oxytocin alters the processing of social stimuli, including biological motion, in a manner that depends on one's social proficiency and blood oxytocin concentration. The role of oxytocin in human social cognition is further supported by the finding that it is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction."
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has resulted in a pandemic with over 135 million confirmed cases and over 3 million deaths as of 2021. The virus enters cells by binding its Spike protein to the ACE2 receptor on cell surfaces. Mutations in the Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ACE2 receptor have emerged independently worldwide and can impact the affinity and kinetics of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. For example, the B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. A study analyzed the effect of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, with the exception of the K417N/T mutations, which decreased the affinity. The N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape. Effective vaccines have been developed, and a global vaccination program is underway, but new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are emerging, which may increase transmissibility and resistance to protective immunity induced by previous infection or vaccines.
A study used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large-scale genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. This allowed for the inference of gene function based on statistical genetic interactions and the prediction of protein complexes and clustered processes by similarity. The multivariate nature of the phenotypes was employed to compute directional genetic interactions, revealing the logical and temporal dependencies between functional modules. An example of this is the reconstruction of the temporal order in which protein complexes are active during mitosis. The study also demonstrated an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signalling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodelling. This approach of using large-scale genetic interaction maps can be used to identify regulatory relationships and interpret functional consequences of genetic alterations.
Heterostyly is a widespread floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding and is controlled by the S-locus supergene in Primula (primroses). This supergene determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between two morphs. A recent study identified the Primula CYP734A50 gene as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism, which is specific to the short-styled S-morph haplotype and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. The CYP734A50 gene encodes a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. This discovery provides a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene.
"Kisspeptin (Kiss1) and neurokinin B (NKB) neurocircuits are critical for pubertal development and fertility. In the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, Kiss1 neurons co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin, and glutamate. High-frequency photostimulation of these neurons triggers local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which synchronize Kiss1 neuronal firing. This synchronized activity causes robust excitation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons via both NKB and glutamatergic input. Kiss1 neurons play a dual role in episodic secretion of GnRH and coordinate reproductive function through differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters. Pulsatile secretion of GnRH and luteinizing hormone (LH) is required for normal reproductive function, and Kiss1 neurons are part of the ""GnRH pulse generator."" In mammals, two major populations of kisspeptin-synthesizing neurons exist: one in the anterior preoptic area and the other in the ARH. Both populations co-express other peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters, and Kiss1ARH neurons co-synthesize and potentially co-release NKB and dynorphin. NKB/tachykinin receptor 3 (Tacr3) and dynorphin/κ-opioid receptor (KOR) signaling play a critical role in the generation of episodic GnRH/LH pulses via direct and synchronized action on GnRH nerve terminals in the median eminence. Anatomical tract-tracing studies show that Kiss1ARH neurons are bilaterally interconnected within the ARH and project to GnRH terminals in the median eminence and to Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. A recent study suggests that Kiss1ARH neurons co-express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and release the neurotransmitter glutamate, providing an additional excitatory drive to hypothalamic neurons."
Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling plays a crucial role in the maintenance of pluripotency, suppressing neural specification, and promoting mesoderm differentiation. However, the mechanisms through which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. A study found that BMP regulates differentiation by blocking downregulation of Cdh1, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. The loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thus helping to reinforce the block to neural differentiation. These findings suggest that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues, and that BMP plays a key role in this control mechanism.
The centrosome in quiescent cells contains two centrioles that differ in age, structure, and function, with the mother centriole (MC) being the older one and the daughter centriole (DC) being the younger one. These asymmetries are established and maintained during quiescence, but the mechanisms are unclear. A study found that the daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, Cep120, plays a critical inhibitory role in maintaining centrosome homeostasis. In quiescent mouse and human cells, depletion of Cep120 causes an accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein, and Cep170, leading to increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. This results in aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. The study suggests that Cep120 helps maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the DC, defining a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.
Neuron-glia interactions play a crucial role in the development of neural circuits, including the retina where neurons and Müller glial cells (MCs) exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of maturation. This is facilitated by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses, with MCs responding to cholinergic waves via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and glutamatergic waves through ionotropic glutamate receptors. The decline in MC calcium transients is due to reduced glutamate reaching MCs. This neuron-glia interaction is part of a larger pattern of glial cell involvement in the development and maintenance of neural circuits; in the mature brain, glial cells provide structural support, create physical barriers, and express neurotransmitter receptors. In the developing brain, glial cells secrete factors important for neuronal differentiation, migration, axonal pathfinding, and synaptogenesis. However, the specific mechanisms used for neuron-glial signaling in the developing CNS are not well understood. MCs, the principal glial cells of the retina, play a key role in this process. They envelop synapses of every neuron type, making them well-positioned to receive and respond to neuronal signals. In the retina, MCs maintain homeostasis and integrity, participate in removing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space, and are involved in the delivery of retinol to replenish cone opsin chromophore. MCs are the last retinal cell types to mature, integrating into neuronal circuits during the first two postnatal weeks when the inner retina is undergoing robust synaptogenesis. Retinal waves, mediated by circuits that change as the retina matures, provide a robust source of neurotransmitter that could mediate periodic activation of MCs during retinal development. MCs undergo a dramatic morphological transformation during the second postnatal week, extending many lateral processes into the inner plexiform layer, closely apposing synapses, and participating in removing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space. Two-photon calcium imaging and whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells have shown that MCs express a complement of receptors that allow detection of neurotransmitters released during retinal waves, resulting in parallel activation of this glial network prior to eye opening.
The estimation of the postmortem interval (PMI) is critical in death investigations, but existing techniques are prone to errors and biases. Forensic entomology, which is widely used to assess PMI, can have errors ranging from days to months. A new method using microbes to estimate PMI is being explored, showing promising results in a study using a mouse model system. The study found that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days. The research provides a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggests that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI. The study of corpse decomposition has incorporated an ecological perspective, as a dead body provides a large nutrient resource that can support a complex and phylogenetically diverse community of organisms, progressing through several forensically recognized stages of decomposition. Biotic signatures associated with these stages of decomposition can be used to estimate PMI, but limitations exist in current methods. The use of microbial community change to track the progression of decomposition may circumvent many of these limitations, as microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Further research is needed to accurately test whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate estimates of past events such as PMI.
The developmental genes, particularly the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior-posterior axis, are conserved in bilaterian animals and some non-bilaterian phyla, though not in all. These genes exert their function through interaction with TALE transcription factors. The Hox-TALE networks have emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. However, Hox-TALE networks have also experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. The Zootype, a concept illustrating the strong conservation of embryonic expression profiles of developmental genes in different bilaterian phyla, is not universal as developmental genes could display highly dissimilar expression patterns or even be absent in non-bilaterian lineages. The role of Hox genes outside Bilateria, particularly in the sister Cnidaria group, is unclear, and their orthology status is difficult to assign. Cnidaria is the only non-bilaterian phylum with a bona fide Hox repertoire. The Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution, with Hox patterning functions in Bilateria relying on the presence of the PBC and Meis proteins, which are also present in non-bilaterian phyla. A Hox/PBC/Meis network could first be present in Cnidaria, and Hox and TALE members are co-expressed in the endoderm of the Nematostella embryo, performing similar functions to their bilaterian counterparts. These networks originated from an ancestral generic mode of interaction that was kept in other homebox gene families. Overall, the molecular cues underlying the Hox–TALE patterning system in Bilateria was established stepwise during eukaryote evolution.
"A study used super-resolution microscopy to examine the effect of fluorophore size and photostability on AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in and outside of post-synaptic densities (PSDs) in rats. The researchers attached organic fluorescent dyes, small quantum dots (sQDs), or big quantum dots (bQDs) to AMPARs via different-sized linkers and observed that over 90% of AMPARs labeled with organic dyes or sQDs were stable and confined in nanodomains within PSDs for 15 minutes or more. Less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. However, 90-95% of bQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and only 5-10% were in PSDs. These findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSDs, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. This challenges the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD ""slots."" AMPAR trafficking is critical for synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity, the cellular correlate of learning and memory. The different steps involved in AMPAR trafficking include its exocytosis and endocytosis at sites on the plasma membrane, diffusion to and from these sites and PSDs, and entry into and exit from PSDs. The positioning of AMPAR endo- and exocytosis sites with respect to PSDs is unclear, with some evidence for endo- and exocytosis sites within spines relatively close to PSDs, and other evidence that the sites are on dendrite shafts outside of spines. The recycling pathway under constitutive conditions may be different from the pathway with synaptic plasticity, suggesting that different endo- and exocytosis sites may exist under constitutive conditions versus synaptic plasticity."
In this study, researchers discovered a mechanism for the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia, specifically an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (INa), through the activation of the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). They found that SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels increases INa, and this SUMOylation is necessary for the hypoxia-induced shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation. This shift allows for larger sodium currents in response to depolarizing steps during hypoxia. The researchers suggest that the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions in conditions such as stroke, heart attack, and head trauma. Hypoxia-induced SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels and the resulting increase in INa occur rapidly, within 40 seconds, and are critical for the initiation of the hypoxic response in neurons.
The thermal biology of vector-borne diseases suggests that transmission peaks at intermediate temperatures and declines at high and low temperatures. However, the thermal optima and limits are unknown for many vector-borne pathogens. A mechanistic model was built for the thermal response of Ross River virus (RRV), an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. The model predicts that transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in the nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming will likely increase transmission in temperate areas but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change. RRV has a complex natural history, with transmission occurring across a range of climates and habitats and via many vertebrate reservoir and vector species. The virus has been isolated from over 40 mosquito species in nature, but four species are responsible for most transmission to humans. The vectors differ in climate and habitat niches, leading to geographic variation in associations with outbreaks. Ae. vigilax and Ae. notoscriptus are commonly implicated in transmission in tropical and subtropical zones, Ae. camptorhynchus in temperate zones, and Cx. annulirostris throughout all climatic zones. Freshwater-breeding Cx. annulirostris has been implicated in transmission across both inland and coastal areas, while saltmarsh mosquitoes Ae. vigilax and Ae. camptorhynchus have been implicated only in coastal areas and inland areas affected by salinization from agriculture. Peri-domestic, container-breeding Ae. notoscriptus has been implicated in urban epidemics. The vectors differ in their seasonality, with Ae. camptorhynchus populations peaking earlier and in cooler temperatures than Ae. vigilax, leading to seasonal succession where they overlap. This latitudinal and temporal variation suggests that vector species may have different thermal optima and/or niche breadths, and temperature may impact disease transmission differently for each species.
A study on motor cortical beta oscillations and their behavioral correlates in macaques has discovered that changes in population neural activity and beta oscillations are linked to behavior. The study involved recording multi-scale neural activity from the motor cortex of three macaques while they performed a novel neurofeedback task. The task required the macaques to voluntarily bring their beta oscillatory power to a specific instructed state before executing an arm reach. The results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power had significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Additionally, population neural activity was found to shift farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. These findings suggest that slowed movement onset follows periods of beta oscillatory activity, and this population neural basis may be responsible for the behavioral correlates of beta oscillations. Beta oscillations have been previously linked to various motor tasks, and their presence during a multitude of behaviors has generated different hypotheses about their underlying state, including ongoing sensorimotor integration, coordination, idling, motor preparation, or attention. However, little evidence exists showing that beta oscillations influence spiking activity through ephaptic mechanisms, and experimental evidence of spiking patterns that accomplish the proposed functions while generating beta oscillations is lacking. This study interprets beta oscillations as a statistic of synchronization of the underlying neural signals and investigates how the underlying neural signals change their encoding during epochs when beta oscillations are observed, rather than making claims about the causality of beta oscillations on spiking activity. Overall, this study provides new insights into the behavioral correlates of beta oscillations and their relationship to motor cortex encoding of movement.
TRAF2 is a crucial component of TNF superfamily signalling complexes and plays an essential role in regulating and maintaining immune cell homeostasis. However, its role in adult tissues is not well-explored due to the perinatal lethality of TRAF2 deficient mice. The role of the TRAF2 RING is controversial, with some claiming it cannot function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase and others claiming it requires a co-factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), generated by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), to function as an E3 ligase. A study found that keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2 disrupted TNF-mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling, causing epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation, while Sphk1 deficiency did not have the same effect. This specific tissue function of TRAF2 does not overlap with that of Sphk1, indicating that TRAF2 has essential tissue-specific functions. TRAF2 is an adaptor protein that transduces signals following ligation of certain cytokine receptors including those binding TNF, and contains a RING domain, several zinc fingers, a TRAF-N, and a conserved TRAF-C domain. The RING domain is nearly always associated with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, and TRAF2 can promote ubiquitylation of RIPK1 in TNFR1 signalling complexes. However, TRAF2 also recruits E3 ligases such as cIAPs to TNFR1 signalling complexes, making it difficult to unambiguously determine the role of the E3 ligase activity of TRAF2. Further research is necessary to fully understand the role of TRAF2 and its E3 ligase activity in TNF signalling.
In this study, the authors use synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons to investigate the mechanisms of synaptic vesicle (SV) reformation. They find that in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3, the formation of bulk endosomes is not only not impaired, but is actually enhanced following strong stimulation. The conversion of these bulk endosomes into SVs occurs independently of clathrin, suggesting the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3 and operates during intense synaptic activity. These findings add to the understanding of SV recycling and the mechanisms of SV reformation.
A study was conducted to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action, as there is no current biomarker to quantify their action. The study involved a randomized, crossover, single-blind, discovery study of 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency and no other endocrinopathies. Transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis. The study identified a transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster that were predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. A microRNA (miR-122-5p) that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure was also identified. These results provide a basis for the successful discovery of biomarkers to measure the effects of glucocorticoids, allowing for the individualization and optimization of glucocorticoid therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.
Amino acids activate mTORC1 in mammalian cells through a complex process involving several protein components and regulatory mechanisms. The mTORC1 complex, which is responsible for protein synthesis and cell growth, is activated by amino acids through a heterotetrameric complex of RAG GTPases and a multimeric complex called RAGULATOR, both of which are present on the late endosomal/lysosomal membranes. The RAGULATOR acts as a nucleotide exchange factor, and an additional complex called GATOR acts as a GTPase activating protein. A small GTPase called RHEB is also essential for mTORC1 activation, which is achieved through the amino acid-dependent translocation of the GTPase activating protein for RHEB. The primary amino acid sensors for mTORC1 activation are thought to be internal, suggesting that amino acid transport to the cell interior is critical. However, some recent work suggests that amino acids in the lysosomal lumen are sensed by the vacuolar ATPase, and this signal is transmitted to the lysosomal exterior for activation of the RAGULATOR. The exact spatial and temporal dynamics of the activation of mTORC1 upon amino acid stimulation are not well understood, and further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of mTORC1 activation by amino acids.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that play a crucial role in the induction of T cell immunity to viruses or tumors. The intracellular routing of antigens to specific compartments in DCs is regulated by C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that recognize glycan structures. A study investigating the effect of modifying the glycan composition of ovalbumin (OVA) on the efficacy of cross-presentation, priming, and differentiation of T cells found that conjugation of the LeX carbohydrate to OVA alters its routing from a TAP1-dependent cross-presentation pathway into a TAP1- and Cathepsin-S-independent pathway, devoid of any TLR-signaling dependence, which simultaneously enhanced CD8+ T cell priming and Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells. Cross-presentation was associated with prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11+LAMP1+ vesicles. The study illustrates that small changes in the glycosylation profile of protein antigens can have a great impact on antigen routing within DCs, affecting cross-presentation and Th cell differentiation.
Burkholderia thailandensis uses acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) mediated quorum sensing (QS) systems to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes, including those involved in cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion (T6S) toxin-immunity systems. The T6S system is required to constrain the proliferation of QS mutants in colony cocultures, but not in broth cocultures, due to a metabolic cost associated with QS gene activation and the lack of cell contact in broth. The QS-activated T6SS-1 growth inhibition serves to police and constrain quorum-sensing mutants, and the increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus. This work defines a novel role for T6SSs in intraspecies mutant control and suggests that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems might have generality as a policing mechanism where QS bacteria can control QS mutants. B. thailandensis has three AHL QS systems, BtaR1-I1, BtaR2-I2 and BtaR3-I3, which control hundreds of genes, with the BtaR1-I1 regulon being the largest. Expression of genes shown to encode Type VI secretion system (T6SS) substrates, including characterized toxins and their cognate immunity or antitoxin genes, are activated by QS in B. thailandensis. QS activation of toxin-immunity systems can serve as a policing mechanism to control QS mutants growing among QS competent wild-type cells.
The long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks that account for cognitive performance emerges early in life, with hippocampal theta bursts driving the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations. A study targeting optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age revealed that the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 boosts prefrontal oscillations, elucidating the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain. In both non-anesthetized and urethane-anesthetized mice aged P8-10, the CA1 area was characterized by discontinuous oscillations with main frequency in theta band and irregular low amplitude beta-gamma band components, accompanied by prominent sharp-waves (SPWs) reversing across the pyramidal layer and by strong MUA discharge. The theta bursts in intermediate/ventral hippocampus had significantly higher occurrence, larger amplitude, and shorter duration compared with dorsal hippocampus. Additionally, overall pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral hippocampus fired at higher rates than in the dorsal hippocampus, and SPWs were more prominent in the dorsal hippocampus when compared with those occurring in the intermediate/ventral hippocampus. These differences indicate that the discontinuous theta oscillations in HP have distinct outcomes in their coupling with the PFC, with i/vHP driving neuronal firing and network entrainment in the PL, while theta oscillations in dHP do not substantially account for prelimbic activity. Simultaneous recordings from neonatal CA1 area either in dHP or i/vHP and PL showed that already at neonatal age, prefrontal oscillations are generated shortly after hippocampal SPWs-ripples. The SPWs-ripple-induced oscillatory activity in the PL of neonatal mice was accompanied by augmentation of firing rates, with a significantly higher power of oscillatory activity in theta, beta, and gamma frequency band when induced by SPWs-ripples emerging in i/vHP than in dHP. The direct unilateral projections from hippocampal CA1 area to PL have been extensively investigated in adult brain and are present already at neonatal age. However, a large proportion of pyramidal-shaped cells in the CA1 area of intermediate/ventral hippocampus projects to PL (3.29*103±0.19*103 cells/mm2), while in dHP, very few cells are retrogradely labeled (0.15*103±0.074*103 cells/mm2). These results suggest that the dense axonal projections from CA1 area of i/vHP might represent the substrate of HP-induced oscillatory entrainment of prelimbic circuits. The tight coupling by synchrony and the directed information flow from hippocampal CA1 area to PL via direct axonal projections support this hypothesis, indicating that the HP acts already at neonatal age as a drive for prelimbic activation, with more prominent driving force along the septo-temporal hippocampal axis.
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a key player in transcription, and its C-terminal domain (CTD) undergoes extensive post-translational modifications to regulate the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes. The CTD is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with a consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7, with serine-5 and serine-7 phosphorylation marking transcription initiation, while serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of serine-7 into lysine-7, which can be acetylated or methylated. K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany serine-5 and serine-7 phosphorylation. K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. An unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels. The CTD is a docking platform for protein complexes that cap, splice, and polyadenylate newly-made RNAs and integrates signaling cascades that coordinate various cellular processes with gene expression. The number of CTD repeats is highly variable among different taxa, with more complex multicellular organisms having longer CTDs. Non-canonical amino-acid residues, particularly at the seventh position of the heptapeptide repeat, occur more frequently in vertebrates, and previous work has shown that non-canonical CTD-K7 residues can be acetylated and are associated with transcriptional pausing.
Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are stem cells that are maintained in a quiescent state and become activated in response to muscle injury, proliferating to repair the tissue and self-renewing to replenish the stem cell population. Upon activation, the p38α/β MAPK pathway is activated, serving as a molecular switch. A subset of SCs asymmetrically activates p38α/β MAPK during cell division to promote SC self-renewal and re-acquisition of quiescence. Post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms, including translational repression, contribute to SC activation and maintain the quiescent SC state. One such post-transcriptional mechanism is the regulation of mRNAs by Tristetraprolin (TTP), a target of the p38α/β MAPK pathway. TTP promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3′ untranslated region. Upon satellite cell activation, p38α/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates Tristetraprolin, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell specific knockdown of Tristetraprolin precociously activates satellite cells in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation and cell fusion into myofibers. Therefore, regulation of mRNAs by Tristetraprolin appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling satellite cell homeostasis.
Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 receptor (IL10R) develop very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. A study in mice found that although signs of colitis are absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction begin during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and accompanying diversification of the intestinal microbiota. However, IL10R did not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing the development of murine colitis. Infants with mutations in the IL10/IL10R pathway develop an aggressive form of IBD in early infancy, and the same cellular mechanisms observed in adult mice lacking IL10R may not be operative during the infant developmental period. Therefore, a better understanding of the developmental events early in life that contribute to disease development is needed.
PiRNAs play a crucial role in regulating transposons and other germline genes, with their target gene regulation in Caenorhabditis elegans being mediated by the mutator complex through siRNA synthesis. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the mutator complex were unknown. This gap has been filled by the discovery of the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, which acts downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. This finding suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex. In many eukaryotes, small RNAs regulate cellular mRNAs through sequence complementarity, with the Argonaute proteins playing a key role in RNA silencing. A subclass of small RNAs, piRNAs, is critical for germ cell function, and in C. elegans, they are amplified through a mutator complex-dependent small RNA amplification pathway, generating 22-nt long siRNAs that are bound by the WAGO clade of Argonaute proteins. Tudor domain proteins, which function as protein-protein interaction modules, are also critical for piRNA accumulation and mRNA target regulation. These components are localized to membrane-less, cytoplasmic compartments at the periphery of germline nuclei. The discovery of SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex highlights the importance of multiple perinuclear condensates in promoting mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.
In this study, the bistability of Purkinje neurons, which are critical for cerebellar function, was investigated in vitro and in vivo under anesthesia, as well as in vivo in unanesthetized larval zebrafish. The research confirmed the existence of bistability in these neurons, with tonic firing seen in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. The neurons could switch states spontaneously or with current injection. The activation of AMPARs by climbing fibers was sufficient to trigger bursts, and the initiation of motor neuron spiking was correlated with increased incidence of CF EPSPs and membrane depolarization. The bistability was observed soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persisted at least until late larval stages. These findings provide new insights into the dynamics of Purkinje neurons and have implications for our understanding of cerebellar function and motor control.
A multiscale model has been developed to understand how branched actin networks generate force and shape cellular membranes during endocytosis, a process in which cells internalize materials from their external environment. The model shows that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against membrane tension, and that around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization. These complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Actin filaments in the network self-organize into a radial branched array, with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Bent filaments between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit store elastic energy, contributing to endocytic internalization. Increased membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. This spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism, enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints. Actin filaments organize into specific geometries for various cellular processes, with branched actin networks playing a key role in membrane deformation. Actin's role in membrane shape changes during clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been studied due to the availability of quantitative information about the positions, recruitment timing, and biochemical functions of many of the participating proteins.
Macropinocytosis is a fundamental cell mechanism that allows cells to take in large volumes of extracellular liquid into vesicles for nutrient uptake. It involves the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, creating a cup-like structure that eventually forms a vesicle. In Dictyostelium, macropinocytic cups are organized around coincident patches of PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac, with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones, and the process is dependent on Ras signalling and PIP3. Macropinocytosis is an important process in various biological contexts, including drug uptake, immune cell function, and cancer metabolism. It involves the polymerization of actin around the cup, which is initiated by nucleators such as formins and the Arp2/3 complex. The dynamic actin polymerization is controlled by the WASP family of nucleation promoting factors, with SCAR and WASP being the most relevant for the plasma membrane. Macropinocytic cups can form by a self-organizing process within the actin polymerization machinery and its regulators, and the activity of Ras, PIP3, and SCAR are crucial for its organization and function.
The cohesin ring, a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together, is loaded onto DNA by the Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 complex, which determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and defects can lead to chromosome missegregation and developmental problems. A study using budding yeast found that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required for recruiting Scc2/4 to centromeres and building pericentromeric cohesion. The cohesin loading activity of Scc2/4 in vitro only requires Scc2, but in vivo, Scc4 is essential, and disruption of Mau2Scc4 function is probably lethal. The study shows that Scc4 targets cohesin loading to a specific genomic locus and that this function is separable from its essential role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome.
The study investigates the effects of birth time and food availability on the growth, energy-saving strategies, body size and fat content, hibernation patterns, and fecundity of female juvenile dormice. The results indicate that late-born (LB) dormice increase growth and body mass gain compared to early-born (EB) individuals, supporting the time-stress hypothesis. This accelerated growth is likely in response to day-length and melatonin as environmental cues for dormice to regulate their rate of growth. LB juveniles were structurally smaller but fatter compared to EB individuals at the start of the experiments, due to differences in maternal energy allocation to offspring. Intermittent fasting had no effect on growth rate, maximal pre-hibernation body size and fat content. Dormice differed in their use of torpor depending on the time of birth and food availability, with two different phases of torpor use. The use of torpor during the growth phase represents a response to the acute energetic challenge, while ad libitum fed dormice avoided regular use of torpor during the growth phase. The strategy of higher energy consumption was used by LB dormice, along with a decrease in activity time and an increase in energy intake. LB juveniles benefited from captive conditions, as foraging was associated with low effort unlike in the wild. Despite an increased intake of food, LB dormice did not reach pre-hibernation body fat levels similar to EB individuals, suggesting that LB dormice might have exploited the full potential of this compensatory strategy.
In a study of the ADAR (Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA) proteins, which alter gene expression by catalyzing adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing and binding to regulatory elements in target RNAs, the neural transcriptome of Caenorhabditis elegans was isolated and analyzed. Using a fluorescent marker and FACS, neural cells were isolated from wild-type and adr-2 deficient worms. RNA-sequencing of poly-A+ selected RNA from wild-type and adr-2 deficient neural cells was then performed. The SAILOR (Software for Accurately Identifying Locations Of RNA editing) software was developed and used to identify and estimate A-to-I editing events in the neural transcriptome. This identified over 7300 editing sites in the wild-type neural transcriptome, mapping to 549 genes, 104 of which are novel edited targets. Over 86 out of 86 predicted editing sites were confirmed through Sanger sequencing, indicating a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Additionally, a differential expression analysis identified 169 genes whose expression was changed upon loss of adr-2. Clec-41, a gene previously found to be important for proper worm locomotion, was found to be expressed and edited within the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) in neural cells. Transgenic expression of clec-41 in neural cells of adr-2 deficient worms was sufficient to rescue the aberrant chemotaxis, indicating deamination is required for both gene regulation and chemotaxis. This is the first study to link noncoding A-to-I editing and altered expression of a specific transcript with a neurological consequence resulting from loss of ADARs.
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes infectious disease and significant public health problems. IAV, like all viruses, relies on the host cell's protein synthesis machinery to produce its proteins. To ensure access to this machinery, IAV utilizes host shutoff mechanisms that eliminate competition from cellular transcripts. These mechanisms can be divided into two categories: 1) direct co-opting of the translation machinery, and 2) viral-induced degradation of host mRNAs. IAV has been shown to use both of these strategies. The first strategy involves the viral protein NS1 inhibiting polyadenylation of host pre-mRNA and the degradation of the host RNA polymerase II complex. The second strategy involves the recently discovered IAV protein PA-X, which selectively degrades host mRNAs.A study by Rambaldi et al. aimed to explore the mechanisms used by IAV to induce host shutoff. The researchers used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to measure the changes in host gene RNA and translation levels during IAV infection. The results showed that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and that the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool. Additionally, the study found that short transcripts are less affected by IAV, and these mRNAs are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the study found that continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. These findings suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.In conclusion, IAV uses a combination of direct co-opting of the translation machinery and viral-induced degradation of host mRNAs to ensure priority access to the host translation machinery. This is achieved through the viral protein NS1 inhibiting polyadenylation of host pre-mRNA and the degradation of the host RNA polymerase II complex, as well as the recently discovered IAV protein PA-X, which selectively degrades host mRNAs. The study by Rambaldi et al. provides new insights into the mechanisms used by IAV to induce host shutoff, specifically the finding that short transcripts are less affected by IAV and are enriched in cell maintenance processes. These findings suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions and highlights the importance of continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity for viral propagation.
In this study, the distribution of a signaling protein, FGF, was examined in the Drosophila larval wing imaginal disc. It was found that FGF moves from the wing disc to the air-sac-primordium (ASP) through FGFR-containing cytonemes, which are extended from the ASP to contact the wing disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, creating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. This gradient induces concentration-dependent gene activities, such as pointed-P1 at higher levels and cut at lower levels. These transcription factors antagonize each other and differentially regulate the formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. These results suggest a mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion. Additionally, it was found that a Drosophila FGF family protein, Branchless (Bnl), forms a long-range concentration gradient by dynamically adopting the recipient ASP-specific shapes and contours. Bnl moves target-specifically from the producing cells to the ASP through cytonemes and functions as a morphogen. A novel self-regulatory mechanism of cytoneme-mediated signaling by which the Bnl morphogen gradient forms was also uncovered. These findings showed an example of morphogenesis in which cytoneme-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.
Coiled coils are well-understood protein folds with a unique backbone structure that can be described by parametric equations, allowing for their detailed manipulation. They are formed by at least two α-helices, wound into superhelical bundles and held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. A heptad sequence repeat pattern is commonly observed, with seven positions labeled a-g, where a and d are typically hydrophobic. While the structure of coiled coils is well-understood, a study has shown that insertions of two or six residues into the heptad repeat can lead to the formation of a new type of fiber. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands that move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. This results in an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. This discovery shows that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.
Epsin is an evolutionarily conserved endocytic clathrin adaptor whose functions include helping generate the force for invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits, and a low affinity interaction with SNAREs. A study using conditional epsin triple KO mice found that embryonic fibroblasts from these mice displayed a dramatic cell division defect and a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This was due to a perturbation in the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, epsin functions in close cooperation with Sla2/Hip1R and confers membrane curvature generation and sensing properties to the protein. However, despite strong evidence for a role of epsin as a clathrin adaptor for ubiquitinated cargo, germline knockout of the mouse Epn1 and Epn2 genes did not block early embryonic development. Instead, arrest of embryonic development occurred only at E9.5-E10, with a pattern suggestive of impaired Notch signaling. Studies of epsin 1 and 2 conditional double KO endothelial cells revealed a selective defect in the internalization of ubiquitinated VEGF receptor. A recent study based on RNAi-mediated knock-down in fibroblastic cells reported that the KD of all the three epsins produces a global impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, results from triple KO (TKO) cells generated from conditional epsin TKO mice show that epsin provides a link between the clathrin coat and actin and is needed for the transition of pits from a shallow to a deeply invaginated state. An additional function of epsin is a low affinity interaction of its ENTH domain with synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 (Syb2) that may help ensure the presence of a vesicular SNARE in the budding vesicle.
A study was conducted to investigate the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda. The case-control study included 555 cases and 1115 controls. The main risk factors for asthma were tertiary education for fathers and mothers, area of residence at birth, father’s and mother’s history of asthma, children’s own allergic conditions, atopy, and cooking on gas/electricity. The study found that asthma was associated with a strong rural-town-city risk gradient, higher parental socio-economic status, and urbanicity. This work provides a basis for future studies to identify specific environmental/lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in urban areas in LMICs. Asthma is a common condition affecting over 235 million people globally, with a higher prevalence in urban areas in Africa. However, the causes of this increase are not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested risk factors such as current residence in urban areas, maternal smoking, maternal history of asthma, childhood atopic sensitisation, and history of allergy. Unlike in HICs, higher parental education and socioeconomic status have been associated with asthma among children in Africa. The study aimed to investigate the main risk factors for asthma and the patterns of allergic sensitisation among schoolchildren in an urban area in Uganda.
In adult zebrafish, a pattern of dark and light stripes is created by three types of pigment cells: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. The stripe pattern is formed during metamorphosis, starting around 3-6 weeks of development. Iridophores initiate the process by forming a pre-pattern, followed by the appearance of xanthophores and melanophores. Interactions between all three cell types are required for stripe formation, and mutations in certain genes can result in abnormal patterns. For example, mutations in leopard (leo), which encodes Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), lead to spotted patterns, and a new dominant allele, leotK3, causes a complete loss of pattern due to a dominant negative impact on another gap junction component, Cx39.4 (luchs). Both leo and luchs are required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not iridophores, and they form heteromeric gap junctions that promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, instructing the patterning of iridophores.
The olfactory systems of various animal phyla detect a wide array of behaviorally relevant odor molecules through gene families that exhibit high diversity. Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory (OR) or ionotropic receptors (IR) and, in some cases, gustatory receptors (GRs). IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, while ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. However, a study examining the olfactory systems of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata, the firebrat Thermobia domestica, and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium found that ORs and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco) are absent in Lepismachilis, while in Thermobia, three Orco candidates were identified, and in Phyllium, a fully developed OR/Orco-based system was present. The study suggests that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs.
Malaria burden has decreased over the past decade, with many nations attempting elimination. However, asymptomatic malaria infections pose a major hurdle for elimination efforts as they are often not diagnosed or treated. A study in Myanmar examining the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) on malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections found that individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA. High mosquito biting rates, living with someone else with malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA may frustrate elimination efforts. MDA has been used for various infectious diseases and has been trialed for P. falciparum malaria in several locations in Africa and Asia. It is being considered as a tool for elimination, but there has been hesitance due to the potential for drug resistance. MDA should be used in settings with strong public health infrastructure and has been shown to quickly reduce or eliminate parasite reservoirs and act as a catalyst for subregional elimination of P. falciparum malaria.
The divergent morphology of species has been primarily attributed to genetic differences in the tissue-specific expression of proteins, which can be achieved through divergence in cis-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs). However, assessing the relative importance of these factors has been challenging due to different methods used in various species. A study determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs and compared them to human and mouse data, finding that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, even at the level of dinucleotide binding preferences. These conserved specificities extend to orthologous TFs and are suggested to contribute to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.The divergence between vertebrate and invertebrate lineages occurred around 600 million years ago. After this divergence, protein coding sequences have retained a relatively high level of similarity, whereas homology in gene-regulatory elements is not detectable. This lack of sequence conservation in gene regulatory elements, despite their conserved function, could be due to divergence of the gene regulatory code between vertebrates and invertebrates. Some changes in coding sequences of TFs have been observed and linked to specific evolutionary adaptations. Systematic comparisons of DNA binding specificities between vertebrates and invertebrates have been difficult due to differences in methods and data sources.Despite these challenges, studies have shown that primary TF DNA binding specificity evolves slowly and is extremely conserved between mammalian species. The origin of most structural families of TFs predates the emergence of mammals, and within each TF family, DNA binding specificity has diverged considerably. Furthermore, many differences in the TF repertoire between invertebrates and vertebrates exist due to the expansion of some gene families, such as nuclear receptors and C2H2 zinc finger factors in vertebrates. It remains unclear to what extent such expansion of TF families has changed the gene regulatory code by introducing novel DNA-binding specificities. The lack of large, high resolution datasets generated using similar methods has limited previous studies of conservation of TF binding specificity to studies of divergence of strong core binding specificities in a limited number of cases. However, in addition to the primary specificity, many TFs have secondary modes of DNA binding, can recognize multiple different homodimeric sites, and recognize multiple different sequences based on DNA shape. These more subtle DNA binding preferences could potentially change faster than and independently of the canonical core DNA recognition motif, and could thus also allow TF specificity to slowly drift in evolution.
A novel stepwise strategy has been developed for the simultaneous induction of mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). This was achieved through temporal specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. The differentiated cells were then used to establish concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-tissues (μTs) in a 3D suspension culture, leading to expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage μT effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. This multilineage differentiation model offers an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis. This study holds significance as it provides a platform for understanding the complex interplay between developing heart and lung tissues, which is critical for proper morphogenesis and maturation. The ability to direct the differentiation of hiPSCs into both cardiac and pulmonary lineages within a single culture system offers a powerful tool for studying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and disease mechanisms, with potential applications in drug development and personalized medicine.
The mutation rate in organisms is a carefully regulated parameter, traditionally considered to evolve slowly. However, new research indicates that cellular mutation rates can rapidly change in response to selective pressure, even within the same generation. This happens through a process where cells alternate between increases and decreases in mutation rates in response to stress levels. In the case of Escherichia coli cultures adapting to high ethanol stress, hypermutation was shown to independently evolve and drive the quick evolution of mutation rates. Importantly, cellular mortality was identified as the major force driving this quick evolution. These findings are significant as they provide insights into the balance between robustness and evolvability in organisms, and help explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, from antibiotic resistance in microbes to cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. Understanding the dynamics of mutation rate evolution is crucial for understanding the interplay between genetic diversity, environmental stress, and adaptation.
Metabolic adjustment to changing environmental conditions, particularly balancing of growth and defense responses, is crucial for organism survival. The evolutionarily conserved AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are well-known metabolic master regulators in low-energy response in animals, yeast, and plants. They act at two different levels: by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. While the first part is well established, the latter function is only partially understood in animals and not at all in plants. Here, the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 was identified as a key regulator of the starvation response and a direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changed its dimerization preference, affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A bzip63 knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites. Flexibility in the regulation of gene expression is crucial for all organisms to adjust their metabolism to changing growth conditions. Particularly under stress, available energy resources need to be balanced between defense and growth. SnRK1 in plants and its orthologs in yeast (Snf1) and mammals (AMPK) are well-known and crucial master regulators of energy homeostasis. SnRK1 is involved in the regulation of plant metabolism, development, and stress response, Snf1 is required for the switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism in the absence of glucose, and AMPK regulates glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and feeding behavior in animals. They are generally activated under energy starvation conditions and trigger metabolic reprograming to slow down energy-consuming processes and turn on pathways for alternative energy production in order to survive the stress conditions by direct phosphorylation and modulation of the activity of key enzymes in nitrogen, carbon, or fatty acid metabolism and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. In plants, the latter aspect, the regulation of transcription, is still poorly understood. Based on reporter gene activation assays in protoplasts and modeling of microarray data, some members of the C/S1 group of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) were speculated to be involved in this process. However, a direct regulation of these bZIPs by SnRK1 has never been shown. bZIP proteins are involved in a multitude of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, stress response, and apoptosis, and their diversity and flexibility of transcriptional regulation can be attributed to their potential to form variable dimer combinations, which bind to different consensus target sites. While the leucine zipper determines the possible dimer combinations, the actual in vivo dimer composition is further influenced by factors such as protein availability, binding of regulatory proteins, or post-translational modifications. In plants, the functional consequences of phosphorylation events of bZIP often remained unclear, but it is known that ABA-dependent phosphorylation of some ABA-responsive element binding proteins by SnRK2 kinases increases their transcriptional activity. Reports on the regulation of dimerization are scarce, and only three publications showed compelling evidence for phosphorylation-dependent changes in bZIP dimerization in animals. However, it is often not entirely clear whether bZIP phosphorylation affects dimerization directly or indirectly by enhancing DNA binding.
RNF10 is a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger that plays a crucial role in transferring information from synapses to the nucleus, enabling long-term changes in neuronal excitability. Activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment, RNF10 specifically associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at the excitatory synapse. Following the activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, RNF10 undergoes importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP and LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines. This process of synaptic communication to the nucleus is essential for regulating the transcription of genes associated with long-term structural changes of neuronal excitability. NMDAR activation, calcium signaling, and the nuclear import of proteins released from synapses all play a key role in this regulation. RNF10 interacts with the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs, and this interaction is modulated by calcium and calmodulin, indicating that calcium signaling plays a critical role in this synaptonuclear communication. Overall, this synaptonuclear communication mechanism plays a crucial role in long-term changes in neuronal excitability and plasticity, and dysregulation of this process may contribute to various neurological disorders.
Swi2/Snf2 ATPases, a large class of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, lack detailed structural information on their ATP-dependent remodeling reactions. Mot1, a single subunit remodeler, dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP) from DNA, providing a system to study the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Researchers report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and negative cofactor 2 (NC2), showing that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2. This study offers a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex. Swi2/Snf2 ATPases, specifically Mot1, regulate the spatial arrangement and histone composition of nucleosomes. High-resolution structures of some Swi2/Snf2 domains and their substrate-interacting domains associated with DNA and protein have been described, but detailed structural information about these ATPases bound to substrate proteins and DNA is largely absent due to their complex architectures and inherent structural flexibilities. Mot1, a Swi2/Snf2 member, dissociates TBP from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, directly regulating transcription initiation and global redistribution of TBP in the cell. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP revealed that Mot1 consists of 16 HEAT repeats arranged in a horseshoe-like shape, with a long loop between HEAT repeats 2 and 3 that can bind to TBP's concave site and block TBP-DNA association. This finding provides insight into how Mot1 binds TBP and functions as a TBP chaperone.
Cyclic peptide natural products, specifically those containing N-methyl or N-alkyl amino acids, are a valuable source of bioactive compounds due to their modular structure, ease of synthesis, cell permeability, and three-dimensional architectures. These macrocycles have been found to target conserved eukaryotic proteins that play essential roles in calcium-mediated signaling, epigenetic regulation, and secretory protein biogenesis. Ternatin, an N-methylated cyclic heptapeptide, inhibits adipogenesis and becomes cytotoxic at higher concentrations. Previous work identified leucine-4 as an important residue for ternatin's biological activity. A patent application describing partially elucidated structures of five related cyclic heptapeptides isolated from an Aspergillus fungus led researchers to design new ternatin variants. These variants, 3 and 4, incorporate A3-specific residues – pipecolic acid and dehydro-homoleucine, respectively – in place of N-Me-Ala-6 and Leu-4 in ternatin. These new variants were found to be up to 500-fold more potent than ternatin in inhibiting cellular protein synthesis, with compound 4 showing the greatest potency. Further investigation identified the elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA) as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides. This study highlights the potential of cyclic peptides as a new structural class of macrocyclic elongation factor-1A inhibitors for therapeutic intervention.
In this study, researchers aimed to understand the function of the enzyme OCRL, which is known to play a role in certain genetic diseases. They analyzed the protein interactome of OCRL, meaning they identified proteins that physically interact with OCRL. They used a technique called quantitative label-free interaction proteomics by mass spectrometry to do this. This technique allows for the capture of physiologically occurring protein complexes. The researchers generated HeLa M cell lines stably expressing either GFP-OCRL or GFP alone, and then analyzed OCRL specific interactions by analyzing proteins selectively recovered in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from cells expressing GFP-OCRL. They found that GFP-OCRL had a punctate localization, while GFP alone had a diffuse cytosolic distribution, validating GFP-OCRL expressing cells as an appropriate model for their experiments. Further analysis revealed that OCRL interactors include clathrin and other endocytic adaptors, as well as SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits. Prompted by these findings, they examined the contribution of OCRL to clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts and found that the absence of OCRL impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to loose their coat, and such vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells. Overall, these findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, and defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.
A novel regulation axis, FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin, has been discovered in colorectal cancer (CRC), where FAK and PYK2 promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3βY216, thereby enhancing pathway output and intestinal tumorigenesis. GSK3β phosphorylation is a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP for Wnt-induced inhibition of β-catenin recruitment of β-TrCP and subsequent stabilization of β-catenin. Wnt signaling is regulatable in APC-mutated CRCs, and phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 is required for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and crucial for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. GSK3βY216 phosphorylation is necessary for efficient GSK3β ubiquitination, and Wnt3a treatment, which does not alter p-GSK3βY216 levels, impairs basal and Wnt3a-induced GSK3β monoubiquitination. GSK3βY216 phosphorylation is required for activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by suppressing phosphorylated β-cateninS33/S37/T41 recruitment of β-TrCP, as validated in GSK3β knockout ( KO ) MEFs. Loss of both GSK3α/β increases the basal level of β-catenin, and reconstitution of the GSK3β KO/GSK3α KD MEFs with WT HA-GSK3β reduces the basal level of β-catenin to the level comparable to WT MEFs. These findings suggest new therapeutic intervention points and warrant further investigation.
The neural control of transitions between posture and movement involves the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. A study investigating the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures found discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show that humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory. The initiation of movement from a stable posture is a central issue in neuroscience due to the need to overcome reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Balance correcting responses may hinder locomotor initiation and the transitions that are essential to safely navigate our environment. Optimal feedback control theory proposes that the brain implements the optimal means of performing a task by adjusting the appropriate feedback gains to reach the goal. Specific postural configurations and movement patterns are considered separate control policies, one of which must be disengaged prior to the engagement of another. This theory seems to diverge from other motor control theories, such as referent (threshold) control theory. A transition between postures involves a monotonic shift in the referent body orientation, transforming posture-stabilizing mechanisms into movement-inducing ones. The temporal dynamics of sensory feedback gains prior to and during the transition between two motor states were examined to determine whether transition is comprised of discrete events or is a continuous process. The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion. Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture. This influence depends on the muscles’ active engagement in balance control and the alignment of the muscles’ mechanical action with both the plane of instability and the direction of the vestibular disturbance. Contextually-dependent vestibular responses have been observed during both quiet standing and locomotion, where the magnitude of vestibular-evoked muscle responses are modulated further during the phase of the gait cycle.
The transcription factor RpaA in cyanobacteria is the master regulator of circadian transcription, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Its deletion has no effect on viability in constant light conditions but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions of light and dark. This viability defect is due to the strain's inability to maintain appropriate energy status at night, not accumulating carbon reserves during the day, and being defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions. This demonstrates how a circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to enhance fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations. This circadian output pathway plays a crucial role in coordinating central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment.
Transition metals, such as zinc, are essential micronutrients in all organisms but can also be highly toxic in excessive amounts. Heavy-metal transporting P-type (PIB) ATPases, a subclass of P-type ATPases, play a crucial role in homeostasis by providing cellular detoxification and redistribution of these ions across cellular membranes. These ATPases use energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport their cargo. Although PIB-ATPases share a common mechanism described by the Post-Albers cycle, they are subdivided into groups based on conserved sequence motifs and the selectivity towards transported transition metal ions. While Cu+- and Zn2+-transporting PIB-1 and PIB-2 ATPases are relatively well characterized, little is known about the PIB-4 proteins, which are present in plants, archaea, and prokaryotes and have been assigned a role as virulence factors in pathogens. The PIB-4-ATPases have a wide scope of transported ions and are classically referred to as cobalt transporters. However, their metal specificity remains elusive, and some members seemingly have broader or altered ion transport profiles. Here, the study presents structures and functional analyses of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1, revealing several novel features, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine, and a potassium-independent turnover, contrasting to many other P-type ATPases. These results open up for efforts in drug discovery, as PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.
In mammals, many autosomal genes are subject to mitotically stable monoallelic expression (MAE), where only one allele is expressed in a clonal lineage. This phenomenon is significant as it includes genes involved in various human diseases. However, due to the challenges in studying MAE, little is known about its regulation. This study presents a new approach to identify MAE genes with high accuracy using a chromatin signature of chromatin marks associated with active and silenced transcription in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in about 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes, and is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. This new method opens up a new way to study MAE, independent of polymorphisms, and suggests a link between MAE and cell differentiation. MAE is one of the three major kinds of non-Mendelian phenomena that control allele-specific expression in mammals, along with X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. MAE affects about 10% of tested genes in human lymphoblastoid cells and is linked to changes in chromatin states in some special cases, but its biology and function remain largely unknown. This study's new approach to detecting MAE, which relies on a specific chromatin pattern rather than allele-specific information, can help address questions about MAE's prevalence, development, and function.
The AAA+ (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) proteins control numerous essential cellular activities by converting the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force to remodel bound substrates. They are key players in protein quality control by targeting misfolded and aggregated proteins to degrading and refolding pathways. AAA+ proteins can be harmful if their unfolding activity is linked to protein degradation, and therefore their activity needs to be tightly controlled. This control is frequently executed by adapter proteins that select substrates and can also regulate the ATPase activity of AAA+ proteins and couple substrate delivery to ATPase activation. Repression of ATPase activity is achieved by regulatory coiled-coil domains inserted into an AAA module. In the ClpB/Hsp104 disaggregase, a long coiled-coil middle domain (MD) forms a repressing belt around the AAA ring to reduce ATPase activity. Adjacent MDs bind to each other by head-to-tail interactions keeping the regulatory domains in place. ATPase repression is relieved by MD dissociation and binding to Hsp70 adaptors that prevent reassociation of MDs with the ClpB/Hsp104 ring. The bacterial AAA+ chaperone ClpC associates with the peptidase ClpP to form a central proteolytic machinery of Gram-positive bacteria. The ClpC-ClpP machinery acts in regulatory and general proteolysis, controlling multiple cellular pathways and differentiation processes and is crucial for bacterial stress resistance and virulence. ClpC activity crucially relies on cooperation with adaptor proteins including MecA, that target specific substrates while concurrently stimulating ClpC ATPase activity. MecA binds to N-terminal and middle domains of each ClpC subunit forming a separate layer on top of the ClpC AAA ring. How ClpC is kept inactive in adaptor absence, and how the adaptor activates the ATPase is largely unknown. Understanding ClpC regulation is particularly relevant as AAA+ protease machines including ClpC have attracted considerable attention as targets for antibacterial action in recent years. Overruling AAA+ protease control by small molecules can lead to constitutive uncontrolled and toxic activation as best exemplified by acyldepsipeptide antibiotics of the ADEP class targeting the ClpP peptidase. ADEP-activated ClpP causes aberrant protein degradation and even allows for eradication of Staphylococcus aureus persister cells. Therefore, understanding ClpC activity control might open new avenues for antibiotics development. Here, the authors report on an unexpected mode of AAA+ chaperone control involving transition between an inactive resting state and a functional hexamer as revealed by determining the cryo-EM-structures of S. aureus ClpC in absence and presence of MecA. The ClpC resting state is composed of two helical ClpC assemblies stabilized by head-to-head MD interactions. MecA prevents MD interactions and thereby converts ClpC into a canonical and active hexamer.
Stem cells, which have the ability to maintain an undifferentiated, quiescent state and then become activated to contribute to developmental growth or damage tissue regeneration, are crucial for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Stem cells can be found in various tissues in both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms. These stem cells can be multipotent, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) which can give rise to a broad range of cell types, or committed precursors, such as the satellite cells required for postnatal growth and the repair of specific tissues, such as skeletal muscle. Importantly, stem cell activity and capacity to maintain tissue homeostasis depend on a specialized microenvironment called the niche. Niches can house a single stem cell or more than 10 stem cells and can occupy a single spatially invariant location throughout adult life or form a complex system of multiple niches distributed throughout tissues. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that control niche occupancy by stem cells remain poorly understood.Recent work on myogenic progenitor cells has shed new light on the issue of niche occupancy by stem cells. It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for the homing of emerging satellite cells by stimulating them to produce basal lamina, thus promoting their adhesion to myofibers. If the homing process is impaired, satellite cells are unable to receive inductive signals and thus efficiently contribute to muscle growth and regeneration.In the study discussed in the article, the researchers applied a Drosophila model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. They report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. The researchers found that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs, which leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Overall, the study reports that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs.
Spontaneously active neurons are capable of continuously firing action potentials in the absence of synaptic input, an ability supported by their intrinsic membrane properties. A crucial aspect of this ability is the presence of a tonic current, often referred to as a 'leak' or 'background' current, which helps maintain the neuron at a more depolarized membrane potential. In the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), GABAergic neurons fire spontaneously at high rates to provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. These SNr neurons have a leak current that is necessary for their spontaneous firing and thus crucial for the function of the basal ganglia. A study using single-cell RNA sequencing found that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. NALCN is also involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Disruption of NALCN could therefore impair the basal ganglia circuit, potentially underling the severe motor deficits seen in humans with mutations in NALCN.
Antibiotics from a few culturable microorganisms have been life-saving since the 20th century, but their effectiveness is decreasing due to resistance formation. Most microbes and chemical compound diversity remain inaccessible for cultivation and exploration. A droplet-based microscale cultivation system that increases throughput and sensitivity by miniaturization has been developed to address this issue. This system resulted in the cultivation of yet uncultured species and a higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation. The system led to the isolation of strains able to inhibit intact reporter strains and the detection of a variety of antimicrobial compounds for a selected potent antibiotic producer. The microbial diversity in environmental habitats provides a rich resource for medically relevant substances, and a large portion of this diversity is still uncultured. New techniques are being developed to unlock the biosynthetic potential of these so-far uncultured microbes, including the adaptation of media concentration and composition, the mimicking of in situ conditions, and providing direct contact with the environment. The most advanced development in this direction is to provide direct contact with the environment, which has proven highly productive in culturing species regarded as unculturable. A complementary trend is the miniaturization of culture vessels to save material and time while increasing throughput. These microscale culture techniques enable partitioning of complex bacterial communities at the single-cell level, allowing various species to grow at their own speed without competition for space or nutrients.
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a severe form of tuberculosis with high mortality rates, despite effective antimicrobial therapy. Excessive intracerebral inflammation is believed to contribute to TBM mortality, and adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids have been shown to reduce mortality by 30%. However, a subset of deaths is not influenced by inflammatory pathophysiology. A Vietnamese study found that the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a C/T promoter variant in the LTA4H gene, which encodes an enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosanoids. In contrast, an Indonesian study did not find an LTA4H TT genotype survival benefit. Bayesian methods were used to analyze both studies, and the results suggest that the LTA4H TT genotype confers a survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations, but this benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality. LTA4H genotyping together with disease severity assessment may target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it.
In this study, the role of shootin1a in axon guidance was investigated through the analysis of its localization and function in the developing mouse brain. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that shootin1a is widely expressed in the brain, with high levels of immunolabeling in axonal tracts such as the corpus callosum and anterior commissure. Shootin1a interacts with F-actin flow via cortactin and couples the F-actin flow with extracellular adhesive substrates through the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM. Upon activation by netrin-1, Pak1 phosphorylates shootin1a, which enhances shootin1a interaction with F-actin flow, thereby producing traction force on the substrate. However, the study found that shootin1a does not mediate axon guidance in vitro and in vivo. Spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones is necessary for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients, and netrin-1-elicited shootin1a phosphorylation promotes direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM, thereby generating traction force for growth cone motility. Disruption of spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones inhibits axon turning, but not axon outgrowth, induced by netrin-1 gradients. In conclusion, shootin1a, through its spatially regulated phosphorylation within growth cones, mediates the gradient reading and mechanoresponse for netrin-1-induced axon guidance.
A study was conducted on six freely hovering Anna’s hummingbirds to understand how hummingbirds hum. The research combined acoustic nearfield holography and a 2176 microphone array in vivo while directly measuring the 3D aerodynamic forces using a new aerodynamic force platform. The study found that the timbre of the hummingbird’s hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. The analysis of the hummingbird’s hum was compared with birds and insects and found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings originate from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their bodyweight. The research showed that allometric deviation makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, clarifying complex bioacoustic behavior. The study highlighted the diverse adaptations of birds, bats, insects, and owls, illustrating how a wide range of mechanisms can contribute to the sound that flapping wings generate. Although the physical understanding of how wings generate sound is primarily based on aircraft wing and rotor aeroacoustics, the research emphasized the lack of a simple model that can predict the acoustic near and far field generated by animals across taxa without using computationally expensive fluid dynamic simulations. The study proposed that hummingbirds are an ideal subject for developing and testing a model of flapping wing hum.
The roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in evolution have not been resolved and were assessed through a study that combined ancestral protein reconstruction and a new continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family. The study found that contingency, generated by historical substitutions, steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation. Trajectories launched from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded virtually no common mutations, indicating the idiosyncrasy of BCL-2 sequence variation. The study highlights the importance of measuring the effects of chance, contingency, and necessity during evolutionary history in the same system over long timescales to understand the relative importance of these factors. The study suggests that the patterns of variation in BCL-2 sequences, and likely other proteins, are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events. The answer to whether biological diversity primarily reflects a predictable process of adaptation to distinct environments or the unpredictable product of random events and historical contingency has strong implications for how we should analyze the particular forms of variation that exist today.
The article discusses the use of genetic data to study the population history and ancestry of different groups in Africa. Genome-wide, haplotype-based analyses of genetic variation in a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups reveal shared ancestry and historical connections between different population groups due to admixture. The authors find that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. The authors also highlight the relevance of these findings to studies of genetic epidemiology, as understanding haplotype sharing and gene-flow between populations can provide insight into the movement of alleles into new environments. The article also discusses the growth in the amount of genomic data available for analysis, and the importance of studying genetic variation in African populations to understand the genetic basis of human phenotypes. The authors note that while tens of thousands of genetic variants have been associated with different diseases in populations of European descent, less progress has been made in studies of important diseases in Africa. They mention several consortia and studies that are beginning to focus on understanding the genetic basis of infectious and non-communicable disease specifically in Africa.
The development of many animals, including Xenopus laevis, is characterized by rapid cell cleavages that reduce cell size but how the mitotic spindle adapts to these changes in cell dimensions is not well understood. To study this, an in vitro system was established using cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus laevis embryos that recapitulates the in vivo spindle size differences between different stages of embryogenesis. The kinesin-13 kif2a was identified as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in early stage spindles by the transport receptor importin α, and activated in later stages when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impairs spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remains robust. Thus, spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization.
Gene control systems can interpret multiple signals to set the expression levels of the genes they regulate, with some riboswitch aptamers forming tandem arrangements to approximate the function of specific two-input Boolean logic gates. A study reports the discovery of riboswitch aptamers for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) that naturally exist in singlet arrangements or in tandem with guanine aptamers. These tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind target ligands, either independently or in combination, to regulate transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria. The existence of these all-RNA regulatory systems supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed a complex metabolic state without the assistance of protein regulatory factors. This discovery also highlights the potential for riboswitches to regulate multiple genes in response to diverse ligands, further expanding our understanding of the complex regulatory networks within cells.
The number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential plays a crucial role in the reliability of synaptic transmission, and the variability of this property provides diversity of synaptic function across brain regions. The source of this variability is unclear, but it is generally believed to be due to variability in vesicle release probability, which is calcium-dependent. However, a new study using mouse brain slices has found that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool, upstream of vesicle release probability. The study suggests that protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. These findings define molecular mechanisms that control multivesicular release and functional diversity of synaptic signaling. Excitatory glutamatergic synapses mediate the majority of fast communication between neurons in the brain, and the number of vesicles released in response to an action potential is a fundamental parameter that controls synaptic efficacy. While it was originally thought that at most one neurotransmitter-filled vesicle could be released per active zone, it is now known that multiple vesicles can be released from a given active zone, a process termed multivesicular release (MVR), and some synapses are limited to the release of a single vesicle per active zone, termed univesicular release (UVR). Understanding the mechanisms that determine whether an active zone supports UVR or MVR is important for understanding synaptic diversity and developing unifying models of presynaptic function that account for multiple presynaptic parameters.
In the reconstitution of HIV-1 selective genome packaging using a minimal system, Gag assembles on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and selectively packages the HIV-1 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) at subnanomolar concentrations in the presence of excess competitor RNA. The RNA selectivity of Gag is abolished by mutations affecting its ability to cluster on a membrane. Membrane recruitment of the 5'UTR by Gag does not lead to drastic changes in its secondary structure. The association of soluble Gag with tRNA confers additional RNA packaging selectivity. Gag assembling on GUV membranes clusters in a way that mimics the behavior of cellular HIV-1 budding sites in their lipid requirements for assembly, nucleic acid- and ESCRT protein binding. The GUV-bound Gag clusters recruit RNA, and this recruitment is dependent on the NC domain of Gag. The reconstituted system using GUVs, recombinant myristoylated HIV-1 Gag, and purified RNAs provides a platform for further characterization of RNA selection of an assembling HIV-1 virus.
