Gene expression varies between individuals, and regulatory changes can underlie significant phenotypes in evolution and biomedicine. While most studies have focused on the effects of genetic changes on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequences, a recent study investigated the role of RNA 3'-end processing in regulatory variation. The study analyzed transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals and found that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions but preferentially flanked the locations of 3' regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3' motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. The study suggests that the strategy of integrating observed 3'-end positions with inferred 3' regulatory motifs will be a critical tool in interpreting human genome variation. Overall, naturally occurring genetic differences in gene regulation within populations underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical interest, and understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DNA sequence variants give rise to expression change is an important area of research.
The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (LASIV) vaccine, SIVΔnef, is one of the most effective vaccines against wild-type lentiviral challenge, though the mechanisms behind its protective efficacy are not well understood. In this study, deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping were used to understand the immune pressure and viral escape, and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. The results showed that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is predominantly mounted against more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. Importantly, epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, defined as anentropic specificity, and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. These findings suggest that SIVΔnef, long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research, serves as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design.
In the study of mucosal infections with Candida albicans, it was found that cellular immunity plays a crucial role in host protection, but the process of antifungal immunity induction is not well understood. Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), it was discovered that interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection, particularly through its impact on neutrophils at two levels. The recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depend on IL-1R. In IL-1R-deficient mice, there is impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the circulation in response to C. albicans. Endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC, which responded to IL-1α released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. These findings establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection and identify two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa, which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination and thus protects the host from disease. Mucosal infections with C. albicans are the most frequent forms of fungal diseases, and the epithelium plays a crucial role in host defense by providing a physical barrier and producing inflammatory mediators and antifungal defense molecules. Neutrophils are critical for preventing invasion of the fungus in underlying tissues and dissemination to the circulation and visceral organs. Neutrophils are generated from granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in the bone marrow under the control of granulopoietic growth factors, primarily G-CSF. During acute infection, granulopoiesis is massively enhanced to comply with the increased demand for neutrophils in host defense. Control mechanisms of this demand-adapted hematopoiesis involve long-distance regulatory feedback loops induced at the site of infection, where neutrophils act, which is usually distant from the production site of neutrophils in the bone marrow. Increased release of G-CSF in response to infectious and/or inflammatory insult plays a key role in this process. Given the potentially harmful effects of dysregulated neutrophils, granulopoiesis and neutrophil trafficking are under tight control and regulated in a tissue-specific manner.
The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF), which delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals between 2000-2007, has resulted in significant economic benefits. An estimated $21.8 billion will be gained in direct economic benefits over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated, with an additional $2.3 billion realized by protecting nearly 3 million newborns and individuals from acquiring the disease. The health systems of endemic countries will also save approximately $2.2 billion due to reduced patient services. These savings are a result of preventing 32 million disability-adjusted life years, averting 6 million cases of hydrocele and 4 million cases of lymphedema. The economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, making it a smart investment in global health. This program has significantly improved the health of endemic populations and prevented cases of lymphatic filariasis, while also providing economic benefits to individuals and health systems.
A study investigating the relationship between GBA mutations and Parkinson's disease (PD) used medaka fish, a type of fish commonly used in disease research, to generate GBA nonsense mutant (GBA-/-) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. These fish survived for months, enabling analysis of the pathological progression, and displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. However, disruption of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) did not improve the life span, formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka. The study revealed that GBA-/- medaka can be used as a novel neuronopathic GD model and found that the pathological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency have minimal contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD.
Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular bacterium, is known to induce a robust innate and adaptive immune response, with CD8 T cells playing a crucial role in protective immunity. The escape of L. monocytogenes into the host cell cytosol is essential for the induction of long-lived CD8 T cell-mediated protective immunity. A study explored the impact of phagosome-confined L. monocytogenes on the immune response and found that it suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10. This suppression limits not only the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L. monocytogenes but also negates the response to bacteria within the cytosol. Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L. monocytogenes prevents the generation of acquired immunity and limits the expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to the cytosolic L. monocytogenes strain alone. These findings demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the intracellular localization of L. monocytogenes in shaping the immune response and the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying this process.
Glaucoma, particularly the common subtype primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. A genome-wide association study found a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus, specifically the rs10483727 variant. The SIX6 gene is involved in ocular development and has been associated with optic nerve morphology. Researchers sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls, identifying six nonsynonymous coding variants. Five of these variants, found primarily in POAG cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant, found only in controls, was benign. A clinical feature in POAG patients dependent on SIX6 genotype was also discovered: patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele (His141) have a significantly thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele (Asn141). These findings suggest that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells and increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.
"In the human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile, flagella promote adherence to intestinal epithelial cells and impact the production of glucosylating toxins, which are crucial for diarrheal disease development. The flgB operon, which contains early stage flagellar genes, is regulated by a 154 bp invertible sequence called the ""flagellar switch."" The orientation of this switch controls downstream flagellar gene expression and production of flagella and swimming motility, as well as the transcription of toxin genes and the production of glucosylating toxins. This regulation occurs post-transcription initiation and is mediated by the recombinase RecV. The flagellar and toxin phase variation in C. difficile may provide an advantage during infection of the gastrointestinal tract as a bet-hedging strategy. The flagellar operon (flgB) has a single transcriptional start site and a σA consensus sequence, with a class I (GEMM) c-di-GMP riboswitch named Cd1 in its 5' untranslated region. A 154 bp region of reduced sequence identity was found in the 5' UTR of the flgB operon in some C. difficile strains, including the 027 ribotype associated with epidemics of CDI. This region contains near perfect 21 bp inverted repeats, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving phase variation by site-specific DNA recombination. This ""flagellar switch"" undergoes DNA inversion via site-specific recombination, resulting in a heterogeneous population of bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published or inverse orientation. This inversion affects flagellar gene transcription and swimming motility, as well as toxin gene expression and the production of glucosylating toxins."
Endosporulation is an ancient bacterial differentiation program leading to the formation of highly resistant endospores, which is crucial for survival under harsh conditions. This process is widely studied in the model organism Bacillus subtilis, where two cells participate: the forespore and the mother cell. Each cell type has its unique RNA polymerase sigma factors (σF, σE, σG, and σK) that control gene expression during spore development. These sigma factors are sequentially activated, and their activities are interconnected through cell-cell signaling pathways. In this study, researchers investigate the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in Clostridium difficile, an obligate anaerobe and intestinal pathogen.Compared to B. subtilis, C. difficile shows significant differences in the activity and requirement of the sporulation sigma factors. Although the main periods of activity are conserved, σE activity is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and σK activity does not require σG. Moreover, σK is not strictly required for heat-resistant spore formation. These findings suggest that the temporal segregation between the early and late sigma factors is reduced, and the cell-cell signaling pathways are less stringent. Nonetheless, the top level of the endosporulation network, with sigma factors acting as key regulators, is conserved between these two organisms.The conservation of the sporulation sigma factors and their sequential activation in C. difficile have implications for understanding the evolution of endosporulation. This study emphasizes the importance of further investigating the sporulation network and its regulatory interactions in various sporeformers, especially considering the emergence of hypervirulent strains and the role of spores in the infection cycle.
The paper discusses a framework for modeling the dose-response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable, which can closely replicate the steady-state behavior of detailed multisite systems. The reduced framework is useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems, as demonstrated through an application analyzing a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast. The pathway incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold, forming a robust hysteretic switch. The paper also discusses the role of multisite phosphorylation in the emergence of bistability and hysteresis in regulatory processes. The modified fraction (MF) modeling approach is introduced as a simple mechanistic approach for modeling multisite allosteric proteins, which can describe ultrasensitive dynamics without introducing numerous variables. The MF framework can also be extended to other types of multisite modification. The paper applies the MF approximation to model a cell size checkpoint in budding yeast, comparing it with a detailed mechanistic model, and carrying out a mathematical analysis of the proposed checkpoint signaling pathway. The model hypothesizes that the interaction pathway can produce a bistable signal responsible for a sudden switch from polar to isotropic growth once the bud has undergone sufficient polar growth, presenting a clear downstream signal when sufficient polar bud growth has occurred. Overall, the paper presents a framework for modeling multisite allosteric proteins and demonstrates its potential through applications in cell signaling and checkpoint regulation.
"Quorum Sensing (QS) in bacteria, such as E. coli, enables multicellularity and selective advantages for communicating populations. QS is based on genetic ""switching"" phenomena, which are complex and context-dependent, and their mechanistic underpinnings have remained elusive. A study combined experimental work and mathematical models to decipher network connectivity and signal transduction in the AI-2 QS system of E. coli. The study revealed the importance of the LsrR regulator and its determinant role in the E. coli QS ""switch,"" normally masked by interfering regulatory loops. The research provides a ""bottom-up"" approach to unravel complex QS network architectures and coordinate emergent behaviors, contributing to the understanding of how biological systems support accurate signal propagation and the interplay among regulatory sub-structures in gene regulation. This knowledge can lead to the directed coordination of emergent behaviors and have important implications for synthetic biology, systems biology, and biotechnology."
In the sub-Saharan region, where both malaria and helminths are prevalent, the impact of these co-infections is not yet fully understood. A study was conducted to investigate the effect of schistosomiasis on the prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children living in two rural communities in Gabon. The study found that schistosomiasis in children tends to increase the risk of plasmodium infection, and when infected, schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children. Additionally, the study found that soil-transmitted helminths (STH) enhance the risk for P. falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children. These findings suggest that co-infections with helminths and schistosomiasis can increase the risk and severity of malaria infections in children, particularly in areas where these infections are prevalent. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of these co-infections on malaria outcomes in order to inform targeted interventions and control strategies.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donovani infection. They found that the inflammatory response induced by IRF-5 limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1α in dendritic cells. Ablation of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells led to a higher frequency of short-lived effector cells (SLEC), enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and increased IL-12 expression by splenic DCs. Furthermore, mice with a targeted depletion of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells had a significantly lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting that induction of HIF-1α may represent an immune evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses for effective immunity against infectious pathogens while limiting collateral inflammatory damage to the tissue. Excessive immunosuppressive responses can result in the strong inhibition of protective pro-inflammatory responses and lead to susceptibility to infectious pathogens. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a good example of dysregulated balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, characterized by persistent infection of the spleen and immunodeficiency during the chronic stage. Experimental infection with L. donovani results in pathogen-induced disruption of the splenic microarchitecture, mediated by TNF, which is overexpressed during VL. The researchers demonstrated that the inflammatory response following L. donovani infection is largely mediated by the transcription factor IRF-5, which is responsible for the activation of genes encoding for various key inflammatory cytokines. L. donovani infected Irf5-/- mice do not show the hallmark symptoms of VL due to the lack of inflammatory cell infiltration and generate profoundly defective Th1 responses during chronic disease. The role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation on the development of CD8+ T cell responses during VL has not yet been explored. The researchers observed a 3-4 fold increase in the number and frequency of OT-I CD8+ T cells present in the spleen of IRF-5-deficient mice at d7p . i . ; no difference was detected at d14p . i . This suggests that IRF-5 participates in limiting CD8+ T cell expansion and hampering the development of SLEC. Since inflammation is known to induce HIF-1α, they assessed HIF-1α expression in splenocytes from L. donovani infected mice and found that HIF-1α was upregulated in the spleen of L. donovani infected mice. They further found that HIF-1α upregulation was induced by IRF-5-mediated inflammation and that HIF-1α expression was only upregulated in DCs purified from infected IRF-5-sufficient mice but not in those purified from IRF-5 deficient mice. These results suggest that IRF-5 is involved in the induction of HIF-1α in DCs and that HIF-1α upregulation in DCs reduces their stimulatory capacity for T cell functions in vitro. To investigate the role of HIF-1 α expression in DCs during experimental VL, they generated HIF-1α conditional knock-out mice by crossing Hif1aflox/flox with Cd11c-Cre mice. They found that amastigotes were able to survive inside DCs from Hif1aflox/flox—Cd11c-Cre+ mice and that OT-I CD8+ T cells underwent a greater expansion in Hif1aflox/flox—Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to their Cre- littermates as indicated by a larger number and higher frequency of cells present in the spleen at d7 p . i . Unlike in IRF-5 deficient and Hif+/- mice, this difference was still observed at d14 p . i ., when OT-I CD8+ T cell numbers were 3--4 fold higher in the conditional knock-out group. These results suggest that HIF-1α expression in CD11c+ cells favours the development of MPEC and limits CD8+ T cell expansion following L. donovani infection. CD45. 1-OT-I CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred into Hif1aflox/flox—Cd11c-Cre+ mice and their Cre- littermates a day prior to infection with L. donovani amastigotes. CD8+ T cell responses were then monitored at d7 ( peak expansion ) and 14 p . i . ( end of contraction ). Remarkably, OT-I CD8+ T cells underwent a greater expansion in Hif1aflox/flox—Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to their Cre- littermates as indicated by a larger number and higher frequency of cells present in the spleen at d7 p . i . Unlike in IRF-5 deficient and Hif+/- mice, this difference was still observed at d14 p . i ., when OT-I CD8+ T cell numbers were 3--4 fold higher in the conditional knock-out group. These results suggest that HIF-1α expression in CD11c+ cells favours the development of MPEC and limits CD8+ T cell expansion following L. donovani infection.
This systematic review analyzed 14 studies focused on prognostic factors for American visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Latin America, examining potential predictors of adverse outcomes and death. Limitations include the lack of validation of prognostic models and the need for further research. Strongest predictors of adverse outcomes were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, severe neutropenia, ages less than 5 and over 40-50, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Limited studies considered age-specific outcomes and factors like hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and weight loss showed weak associations. Considering the empirical evidence, physicians should carefully monitor VL patients with these risk factors to potentially reduce fatality rates and improve overall disease management.
In Algeria, leishmaniasis, a vector-borne disease caused by Leishmania parasites, is endemic in large areas and affects approximately 12 million people. The country ranks second after Afghanistan for the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and has a high burden of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is caused by L. infantum and transmitted by Phlebotomus perniciosus or P. longicuspis. Over a 30-year period, the National Public Health Institute gathered information about cases of CL and VL, and Leishmania isolates were collected from patients, mammalian reservoirs, and phlebotomine sandflies. These resources were used to examine the epidemiological associations and determine the antimony susceptibility of Leishmania isolates. A total of 106 isolates were studied, and the susceptibility of the Leishmania strains to antimony was determined in vitro. The results showed that there was a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in VL isolates during the 30-year period, but there was an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in isolates causing CL during the same period. The emergence of S- phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L. killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates that cause CL and have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. These findings provide insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria and highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains.
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology, and exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis produces a long-term risk of CD well into the post-infectious period. However, the mechanistic basis for this ongoing relationship to disease onset is unknown. A study found that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, with an attendant increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. The results suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. Importantly, the data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals. CD can involve the small and large bowel and is accompanied by changes in the microbial composition and distribution at these sites. AIEC has emerged as having likely pathogenic significance in CD. AIEC can be isolated from seemingly healthy individuals, implying that interactions between AIEC and other microbes or host genes might be needed to elicit their pathogenic character. CD is more common in individuals exposed to acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella and other enteric pathogens, sometimes with onset times on the order of years after the infectious episode. The mechanistic basis for this long-term risk association following an acute event lasting ~2 weeks is unresolved, but one possibility is that resident gut microbes could perpetuate inflammatory reactions in the post-infectious period. Acute infectious gastroenteritis increases the risk of CD onset, and gastroenteritis causes inflammation that selectively disrupts the resident intestinal microbiota in favor of some members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Intestinal infections with frank enteric pathogens have been implicated as a probable cause of relapse in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
The passage discusses the role of the LIS gene in flowering plants, specifically in the Arabidopsis species. LIS is a homolog of the yeast splicing factor PRP4, and it is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. In the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis, the lis-1 mutation, which is a loss-of-function mutation, leads to the formation of supernumerary egg cells due to accessory cells adopting gametic cell fate. This is because the lis-1 mutation creates an in-frame stop codon after three WD40 repeats, and the LIS protein is strongly conserved among eukaryotes. LIS expression is detected at moderate levels in all tissues examined, with strongest expression in reproductive tissues. GUS expression driven by the LIS promoter is detected at all stages of female gametophyte development, but shortly after cellularization, expression in the accessory cells is down-regulated, whereas expression in the gametic cells is strongly up-regulated. The proposed mechanism is that gametic cells upon differentiation generate a LIS-dependent signaling molecule that is transmitted to the adjacent accessory cells to inhibit their gametic cell competence, thereby preventing excess gametic cell formation. The lis mutant phenotype is a result of impaired lateral inhibition, i.e., the gametic cells fail to identify themselves to their neighboring cells, resulting in the recruitment of all gametophytic cells as gametic cells. The data suggest that a combinatorial mechanism operates to pattern the female gametophyte, and additional factors are needed to explain the generation of four distinct cell fates. The surprising nature of the LIS protein as a splicing factor suggests the participation of components of the splicing machinery in cell fate decisions and the generation of a lateral inhibition signal.
A study on the role of footwear in preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) was conducted in a rural Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis, a type of elephantiasis triggered by exposure to irritant soils in the tropical highlands. The study found that while shoes can prevent podoconiosis and chronic larva migrans, evidence for the role of shoes in preventing other NTDs such as hookworm, helminthiases, Buruli ulcer, snakebite, and tungiasis is inconsistent or circumstantial. The study identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention, including limited access to shoes due to financial constraints, unsuitability of shoes for daily activities, and low risk perception. These barriers are relevant to a range of NTDs. While there is growing interest in the use of footwear in the primary prevention of NTDs, research on the impact of behaviors related to footwear and their impact on NTDs is limited. Therefore, understanding the barriers to consistent use of shoes in a rural setting can provide valuable information for those designing future studies and developing shoe-related prevention programs.
The pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us9 protein plays a key role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of sympathetic neurons, and Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo. The glycoproteins gB, gC, gD, and gE are associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes, and are directed into the axon in a Us9-dependent manner. This report determined that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts, and that this association is critical to Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. Infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells were used, and in these cells, Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. Therefore, association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. Lipid rafts play a key role in the axonal sorting of membrane proteins during neuronal maturation, and axonal growth and guidance. The increased synthesis of sphingomyelin during neuronal maturation is critical for the formation of protein-lipid complexes, an essential step for the targeting of randomly distributed GM1 ganglioside in immature neurons to the axon of fully mature neurons. Alpha herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, replicate and traffic within polarized neurons, and a well-known observation is that upon reactivation from the latent infection, α-herpesviruses rarely enter the central nervous system despite having what seems to be two rather similar choices: cross one synapse and infect the central nervous system (rare) or traffic back down the axon to the initial peripheral site of infection (very common). The Us9 gene product, a small, tail-anchored type II membrane protein, has been of interest in understanding the mechanisms of anterograde transport of alpha herpesviruses in the mammalian nervous system. PRV Us9 directs viral membrane proteins and capsids to axons of infected neurons, an absolute requirement for anterograde neuron-to-cell and neuron-to-neuron spread of the virus.
Genetically identical cells, including those of yeast and bacteria, can exhibit extensive phenotypic variation even under constant and benign conditions. This phenomenon, known as nongenetic heterogeneity, has important clinical implications as it can affect the growth rate and drug susceptibility of cancer cells and microbial infections. In the case of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nongenetic heterogeneity is shown in the form of a positive correlation between growth rate and susceptibility to acute heat stress at the single-cell level. Using a combination of genetic and chemical perturbations along with high-throughput single-cell assays of yeast growth and gene expression, it has been discovered that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its target transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4, underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity. Specifically, lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth, and an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. Furthermore, the paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress tolerance are not inevitably linked. This finding has implications for the potential development of treatments for infections and cancer, as perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with certain chemicals can significantly impact survival of acute heat stress.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus in the Togaviridae family, can cause severe febrile disease in humans. In December 2013, the Asian Lineage of CHIKV spread from the Old World to the Americas, causing a rapid epidemic throughout the New World. A study was conducted to understand how CHIKV may have evolved during this outbreak by studying the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals. Deep-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines were used to characterize the minority variants and diversity in CHIKV-infected individuals from Guadeloupe and Martinique. The study found changes in the consensus sequence and a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population. After single passages in cell lines, overall diversity was dramatically reduced. A novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure was identified, which led to increased replication in insect cells. The study highlights the need for continued viral diversity surveillance over time as this epidemic evolves to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV. Arthropod-borne viruses, such as CHIKV, pose an imminent threat to public health and are continuously re-emerging or spreading to uninfected areas. The CHIKV strain that has arrived in the Americas is from the Asian lineage and has rapidly evolved in a short period since it entered this naïve population. A survey of the mutant spectra present in human clinical samples has not yet been performed for CHIKV. This study characterized the minority variants directly from human samples by whole-genome deep sequencing. The data revealed considerable intra-host genetic diversity, with a 3' untranslated genome region (UTR) duplication unique among the circulating CHIKV strains around the world.
The mTOR signaling pathways, which control cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and survival, are regulated by various factors at multiple cellular organelles and are involved in numerous human diseases. A study has identified UBTOR, a previously unannotated gene, as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. UBTOR encodes a protein without any known functional domains and is conserved in vertebrates. Reduction of UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth, while UBTOR depletion activates mTOR signaling and promotes cell growth. UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. UBTOR inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR complex component DEPTOR, and ubtor gene disruption results in higher mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS (G12V) induced neoplasia in zebrafish. UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. Therefore, UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling.
Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular flagellated parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Nagana in cattle, has a life cycle including an insect stage (procyclic stage) and a mammalian stage. Trypanosomatid parasites, including T. brucei, have a high degree of divergence from well-studied eukaryotes, resulting in a lack of sequence similarity with model organisms for most of their proteins. This has led to the inapplicability of homology-based approaches for the identification of potential functions for over half of all trypanosomatid genes. To overcome this challenge, protein interaction maps are essential for functional annotation of proteins in T. brucei.In this study, the researchers constructed a global co-fractionation network of T. brucei by performing four high-resolution fractionation experiments using two orthogonal biochemical approaches. The fractionation-derived network was combined with other orthogonal resources of protein-protein interaction data to predict the network context of 866 protein groups, including many hypothetical and experimentally unannotated proteins. Clustering of this high-confidence network led to the assignment of 716 protein groups to 128 complexes.This study has several strengths. First, the use of two orthogonal biochemical approaches allows for a high-confidence network of protein interactions. Second, the authors validated the utility of the protein complex map by revealing novel factors involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei. Finally, the high-confidence network provides a useful resource for formulating new biological hypotheses and further experimental leads.However, the study also has some limitations. First, the study was performed using the procyclic life stage of T. brucei, which may not fully capture the complexity of protein interactions in other life stages. Second, the study did not include validation of all the identified protein complexes, so further experimental validation is necessary to confirm the interactions.In conclusion, this study presents the largest proteomics-based interaction map of trypanosomatid parasites to date, providing a valuable resource for the identification of protein complexes and functional annotation of proteins in T. brucei. The results of this study are available at [www.TrypsNetDB.org](http://www.TrypsNetDB.org).
Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant global health issue, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), with an estimated 2.3 billion people infected worldwide. Extrapulmonary TB, including lymph node (LN) infection, is common, and the most common site of extrapulmonary Mtb infection in humans. Macaques are commonly used as models for TB research, and thoracic LNs are frequently infected in Mtb-infected macaques. However, the bacterial dynamics and impact of Mtb infection on LN structure and function are not well-studied. A study was conducted on thoracic LNs from Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, analyzing PET CT scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. The study found that FDG avidity correlated with the presence of live bacteria in LNs at necropsy and that LNs had different trajectories of increasing, maintaining, or decreasing PET activity over time. Rhesus macaques were more susceptible to Mtb infection than cynomolgus macaques, and this is in part due to more extensive LN pathology. Notably, compared to lung granulomas, LNs are generally poor at killing Mtb, even with drug treatment. Granulomas that form in LNs lack B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures, disrupt LN structure by pushing out T cells and B cells, introduce large numbers of macrophages that can serve as niches for Mtb, and destroy normal vasculature. Overall, LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection but also serve as important sites for persistence of significant numbers of Mtb bacilli, and understanding the relationships between LNs, bacterial persistence, and disease progression may yield new insights into disease pathogenesis, improve TB treatment, and limit reactivation of latent TB.
Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that can infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, the prevalence and diversity of microsporidia infections in C. elegans and other related nematodes in the wild were unclear. In a study, 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections were isolated and cultured, revealing that N. parisii is the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. Six new species in the Nematocida genus were further described and named, and two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida were identified and named Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, which belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. These microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except for Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. The spores of Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, unlike Nematocida which exits via exocytosis. Host specificity varies among microsporidia, with some infecting multiple host species and others being more host-specific. The study highlights the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes and provides a valuable resource for investigating host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.
Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), play crucial roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis and HIV infection. Homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 have been shown to modulate receptor function. Membrane cholesterol also affects chemokine receptor activity, but structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited. A study used thousands of molecular dynamics simulations to report homo- and heterodimer configurations of CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at atomistic detail. The results showed that observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs. GPCRs constitute one of the largest groups of cell surface transmembrane receptors, and chemokine receptors, a subgroup of GPCRs, play essential roles in the inflammatory response and have been reported to play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis and as co-receptors for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during cell infection. Chemokine receptors have been indicated to function as homo- or heterodimers or even oligomers of higher order, and the interactions between receptors are mainly formed by their transmembrane helices. Certain membrane components, such as cholesterol or polyunsaturated lipids, have been reported to modulate the function and association of GPCRs. The homodimerization of CXCR4 was shown to prevent TM1 and TM7 from engaging in dimer interactions, while the intercalation of cholesterol between monomers induced a symmetric interface including TM3 and TM4 of both receptors. CCR5 homodimerization was suggested to impair HIV infection, and CCL5, an agonist chemokine of CCR5, was suggested to stabilize receptor dimers. CCR2, closely related to CCR5, was shown to homodimerize and ligand stimulated receptors altered the dimer configuration. Heterodimerization of CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 has been observed and could be connected to modulations of ligand binding and receptor function. Negative ligand-binding cooperativity of allosteric nature across chemokine receptor heteromers was reported, suggesting that usually only one ligand binds to a complex of receptors, inducing conformational changes in the associated receptor. Especially the assembly of CXCR4 and CCR5 gained a great deal of attention since both receptors can act as co-receptors for HIV. It was shown that each receptor can associate with the transmembrane glycoprotein cluster determinant 4 (CD4) and that these associates are used by HIV to enter the cell. A mutant of CCR2 delayed the development of AIDS in HIV-infected individuals potentially due to heterodimerizing with CXCR4 or CCR5. Inducing the oligomerization of CCR2 with CCR5 and CXCR4 with a specific monoclonal antibody was reported to block HIV-entry. Based on the impact of GPCR dimerization on receptor function, novel therapies are developed to target protein association, such as the construction of bivalent ligands that are able to bind both receptors in homo- or heterodimeric GPCR complexes. However, the rational design of new drugs targeting GPCR dimers is subject to the availability of receptor complex structures. Structural information regarding GPCR homodimer interfaces is most frequently derived from available crystal structures, but no crystallographic data on GPCR heterodimers is available. In silico methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven useful to provide molecular information about the dimerization of transmembrane proteins. Especially coarse-grained (CG) simulations are a commonly used method to study GPCR assembly, and the interactions between certain lipid types or cholesterol and GPCRs have been found for several receptors. The binding strength of different dimer interfaces can be approximated with CGMD simulations, and from these studies, energetically favored dimer interfaces and possible energy barriers for dimer formations resulting from trapping of lipids at the interfaces could be elucidated.
"Systemic leishmaniasis, also known as Kala-Azar, is a parasitic disease that typically presents with fever, organomegaly, and wasting, and can be fatal if left untreated. While it is generally considered to have a well-defined clinical picture, recent research has identified a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms associated with the disease. In a study of 160 patients with depressed immunity, 19.4% were found to have an ""atypical"" form of systemic leishmaniasis, characterized by the presence of Leishmania parasites in macrophages but with normal or near-normal laboratory profiles. These patients presented with symptoms mimicking non-functional immune systems and were at risk of recurrent secondary infections. This form of the disease is more common than previously thought and can affect adults as well as children. The study highlights the need for a broader understanding of systemic leishmaniasis and the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients with unexplained depressed immunity. Additionally, the study was conducted in Lebanon and focused on patients referred to a specialized immunology laboratory, so further research is needed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in other populations."
The human genome contains millions of genetic variations, and identifying the ones that cause diseases or have clinical significance is a significant challenge. Computational approaches have used the perturbation of conserved amino acids as a useful criterion for identifying variants likely to have phenotypic consequences. However, a new study explores the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences. The study found that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. Therefore, information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This new approach of using paralogous genes can provide a source of additional information for in silico variation characterization, one complementary to Amino Acid Substitution (AAS) approaches such as SIFT and PolyPhen. The study found that sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance, and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. Thus, knowledge of a sequence variant's paralogous relationships is useful for purposes of in-silico identification of novel disease-causing alleles. The study provides a novel resource for functional genomics and can help in identifying disease-causing variants and their relationships with other variants, diseases, and proteins.
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes severe disease in humans, leading to over 400,000 deaths annually. A study was conducted to analyze gene expression in parasite isolates from patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua, Indonesia. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was used to analyze the transcriptomes of 44 parasite isolates, and it was found that parasites associated with severe malaria had unique transcriptional profiles. These parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways, altered chromatin structure, reduced surface expression of PfEMP1, and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Additionally, there were decreased histone methylation and novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments. These findings suggest how parasites adapt to the host environment in severe malaria and inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria.
A promising approach for preventing HIV-1 infection is the long-term delivery of potent, broadly-neutralizing antibodies. This has been demonstrated in rhesus monkeys using AAV vectors to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG1 form, achieving persisting levels as high as 270 μg/ml. However, host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of delivered antibody. Six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed protective effects against difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac239 challenges, despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus. The protective effects included lowering of viral load at peak height and set point, and delay in the time to peak viral load. An effective preventive vaccine against HIV-1 is considered a difficult task due to the virus's immune evasion strategies, but using AAV vectors to deliver antibodies with potent and broadly-neutralizing activity is a promising approach. Challenges include overcoming anti-antibody responses and developing an effective vaccine to completely block the initial infection or provide immune responses that are more effective than those resulting from infection.
The assumption of linear response of protein molecules to thermal noise or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment, is commonly used in studies of protein dynamics. Conformational motions in proteins are traditionally analyzed in terms of normal modes and experimental data on thermal fluctuations in such macromolecules is also usually interpreted in terms of the excitation of normal modes. However, a study of two important protein motors, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, using numerical investigations within the coarse-grained elastic network approximation, found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. The deficiency is particularly pronounced in KIF1A where the normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions. These results suggest that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered. The study of protein machines, which may represent enzymes, ion pumps or molecular motors, is a major challenge and understanding of their activity is crucial. Operation of these machines is based on slow conformational motions powered by external energy supply, often with ligands (such as ATP). In molecular motors, binding of ATP and its subsequent hydrolysis induce functional mechanochemical motions, essential for their operation. These motions, which follow after an energetic activation, are conformational relaxation processes. Large-scale conformational changes may take place in proteins as a result of ligand binding and despite the large magnitude of such changes, they are nonetheless often considered in the framework of the linear response theory and the normal mode approximation. However, there is no general justification to assume that relaxation processes in proteins are linear and this assumption has to be verified for particular macromolecules. It is known that relaxation processes in complex dynamical systems may be strongly nonlinear and deviate much from simple exponential relaxation. Conformational relaxation in single protein molecules may also be a complicated process, comprising qualitatively different kinds of mechanochemical motions. While partial unfolding and refolding, associated with ligand binding, are known for some protein machines, usually functional conformational motions in molecular machines and, specifically, in motor proteins are elastic. This means that the pattern of contacts between the residues in a protein is not changed upon ligand binding and preserved during the relaxation process.
The studies discussed here focus on the interaction and regulation between different endocytic pathways, specifically between clathrin-independent endocytosis and caveolar proteins. Caveolae, specialized microdomains enriched with cholesterol, have been identified as endocytic vehicles that can interact with other endocytic pathways. The research reveals that caveolar proteins, such as Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, can negatively regulate the CLIC/GEEC (CLathrin- Independent Carriers/GPI-AP enriched Early endosomal Compartment) pathway, which plays a significant role in cellular uptake and membrane dynamics. This inhibition occurs independently of caveola formation and is mediated by the interaction between caveolar proteins and lipid microdomains. In the absence of cavins and caveolae, caveolins, such as CAV1, are endocytosed via the CLIC/GEEC pathway, which loses its polarization and sorting attributes, impacting membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue. These findings highlight the complex interplay between different endocytic pathways and the crucial role of caveolar proteins in regulating CLIC/GEEC pathway activity.
Two-component signaling systems are crucial for bacteria, Archaea, and plants to sense and respond to environmental stimuli. These systems typically involve a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a REC domain on a conserved aspartate residue. However, some REC domains lack this phosphorylatable aspartate, and their functions and regulation are unclear. A study compiled all deposited REC domains missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue, renaming them ALR domains, and found they are common and enriched for rare effector outputs. Analysis of ALRs from Streptococcus pneumoniae suggests they have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation. This work defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains. The REC domain family was found to be missing the conserved phospho-accepting Asp residue in up to 4% of sequences, renaming this subset of REC-type sequences Aspartate-Less Receivers (ALRs). ALRs were found to have unique ED architectures and substitutions within predicted acidic triad positions, indicating they are regulated by input signals other than histidine phosphorylation. ALRs were found in various phyla and were predominantly characterized in pathogens but numerically dominated by environmental bacteria, where greater selective pressures might drive REC divergence to accommodate new input signals.
Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) have shown efficacy in clinical trials and practice, with most gaining cancer-specificity from deletions or mutations in genes that counteract the host response. However, these deletions often result in attenuated or over-attenuated viruses. Researchers have developed next-generation oHSVs that carry no deletion or mutation, and gain cancer-specificity from specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors, such as HER2. These viruses are fully-virulent in the targeted cancer cells and have shown to have a high safety profile in immunocompetent mice. In a study, both unarmed R-LM113 and IL-12-armed R-115 inhibited the growth of primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 (HER2-LLC1) tumors, with R-115 being constantly more efficacious. The viruses were able to induce immunomodulatory cytokines, including IFNγ and T-bet, and increase the presence of certain tumor infiltrating cells. This resulted in a durable response and breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and the wt tumor cells, indicating a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response. These next-generation oHSVs have the potential to be highly safe and effective anticancer agents.
The study investigates the susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells to HIV in response to vaccination with two different viral vectors, Ad5 and ALVAC, tested in the HVTN204 and RV144 trials, respectively. The findings suggest that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells are substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro compared to Ad5-specific CD4 T cells. This difference is associated with reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells, which display a strong Th1 phenotype and produce higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-1β) but little IL-17. Furthermore, while ALVAC preferentially induces CD8 T-cell proliferation, Ad5 vector induces CD4 T-cell proliferation, and depletion of ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells in PBMC leads to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. The study highlights the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination and understanding the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T-cell populations induced by different vaccine vectors.
X inactivation, the transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome copy per female somatic cell, is universal among therian mammals but varies in its choice of which X to silence among species. This variability can be attributed to conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection. A population genetic analysis indicates that a single, critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes. RXI is favored over complete PXI when alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive. The criteria for RXI evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. These results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and can motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation.
ZAP, a host antiviral protein, inhibits the replication of various RNA and DNA viruses by posttranscriptional RNA regulation, such as mRNA decay and translation inhibition. It has been shown to recruit the RNA processing exosome complex and poly (A) specific ribonuclease to degrade the target RNA from the 3'-end, and interacts with p72 RNA helicase to recruit decapping enzymes DCP1/DCP2 and exoribonuclease XRN1 to degrade the target RNA from the 5'-end. In this study, the authors investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP against three flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). They found that only JEV was sensitive to ZAP, with ZAP overexpression blocking JEV infection and depletion of endogenous ZAP enhancing JEV replication. ZAP inhibited JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3'-5' RNA exosome-mediated degradation. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity, and JEV's 3'-UTR, specifically the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide, was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to ZAP. In summary, ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection.
Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic virus that can cause severe disease in both humans and ruminant animals, including hepatitis, hemorrhagic fever, and encephalitis, with a higher mortality rate in animals than in humans. RVFV is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and has recently spread to the Arabian Peninsula, causing significant health and agricultural concerns due to the potential introduction to naïve populations. There are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutic options available for RVFV in humans. However, a live-attenuated vaccine strain, MP-12, has shown promise in animal studies, providing protection in ewes and lambs from wild-type virus challenge.In a study using C57BL/6 mice, researchers found that animals infected with the live-attenuated MP-12 strain survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. In contrast, ZH501 infection was lethal and caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong, systemic cytokine response, which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology. The study found that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with a loss of liver function due to liver necrosis and hepatitis, but the long-term course of disease for those that might survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature. The findings of this study can help guide the development of effective vaccines or therapeutic intervention for RVFV infection in humans. The study was conducted in accordance with animal use protocol approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and all work was performed in a facility accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of laboratory Animal Care.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that is aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is a common treatment for TNBC, but chemoresistance is a major challenge. A study found that C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) was significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response. CCL20 promotes the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) through protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. The blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients. Therefore, CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response. Taxane-induced CCL20 could promote self-renewal of BCSCs through the activation of p65 NF-κB, which was mediated by PKCζ and p38 MAPK activity. The activation of p65 NF-κB further promoted transcription of both ABCB1 and CCL20, which sequentially increased extracellular efflux of taxane and enhanced CCL20 effect via a positive feedback loop, leading to the taxane-resistance of TNBCs and promoting breast cancer progression with worse prognosis. Taxanes are widely recognized as active chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of metastatic and early-stage breast cancer. Cytokine changes during chemotherapy regulate disease progression, favoring the growth and proliferation of tumor cells. However, the involvement of taxane-induced cytokines in chemoresistant breast cancer has not been well studied. A study found that CCL20 was obviously increased in the sera collected during the chemotherapy compared with that collected before NAC in non-pCR patients. CCL20 was also augmented in sera after chemotherapy compared with that collected before NAC in non-pCR patients. CCL20 staining was significantly increased in the tumor specimens from postchemotherapy, representing chemoresistant tumors. CCL20 level was obviously elevated after taxane treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells. CCL20 was the most universally and significantly up-regulated in common. These results suggest CCL20 might play a vital role in regulating the taxane resistance of breast cancer cells. CCL20, a member of the C-C motif chemokine subfamily, participates in many diseases’ progression and promotes the malignancy in colorectal cancer and lung cancer. However, the role of CCL20 in cancers has not been well elucidated. More importantly, little work has been done on the role of CCL20 in regulating the tumor progression and chemoresistance in breast cancer, especially TNBC, and the regulation mechanisms still remain unknown.
Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread intracellular parasite that can infect various nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. Its tachyzoites, which are responsible for acute infection, can invade host cells and form a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within which they replicate. To manipulate the host cell and acquire essential nutrients, Toxoplasma secretes effector proteins from unique organelles called rhoptries and dense granules. These effectors can localize to different parts of the host cell, such as the nanotubular network, PVM, or host cell nucleus. GRA16 and GRA24 are two effectors that localize to the host cell nucleus and affect p53 levels and PP2A-B nuclear translocation, and c-Myc up-regulation, respectively. These effectors are predicted to be intrinsically disordered proteins and are dependent on ASP5 for their export across the PVM. ASP5 cleaves the TEXEL motif in GRA16 and interacts with p38α MAP kinase via a kinase-interacting motif (KIM) in GRA24, leading to the activation of multiple host pathways. However, the process of how these effectors are transported across the PVM is not well understood. In Plasmodium falciparum, effector translocation across the PVM depends on the PTEX complex, which consists of an HSP101 AAA+ ATPase, EXP2, PTEX150, PTEX88, and a thioredoxin domain-containing protein, TRX2. In Toxoplasma, the protein and molecular components required for translocation across the PVM are not well understood. Recently, a novel protein, MYR1, was identified and found to be essential for effector translocation across the PVM and parasite virulence in a mouse model. Two novel membrane proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, were also identified and found to be involved in effector translocation. These proteins form a novel complex with MYR1 at the PVM, and the fusion of intrinsically disordered GRA16 to murine DHFR is sufficient to block its translocation, affecting the translocation of other effectors. This suggests a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these findings reveal new insights into the mechanism of effector transport across the PVM and the molecular components involved in Toxoplasma's manipulation of host cells.
The paper reports the discovery of the binding of human papillomavirus (HPV) and bovine papillomavirus type-1 (BPV-1) E2 proteins to ORC2, a pre-replication complex (pre-RC) factor. However, ORC2 is not present at the viral replicon, and its depletion increases the presence of E1 and E2 at the viral origin. E2 restricts cellular origin recognition by ORC, which would otherwise complete for factors necessary for viral DNA synthesis. This mechanism allows PV E2 to orchestrate the viral genome replication program in a stratifying epithelial environment. ORC2 was not detected near the viral replicon, and ORC2 depletion increased replication of the luciferase-linked HPV-31 ori plasmid driven by co-transfected E1 and E2. ORC2 shRNA had the opposite effect on the HPV reporter compared to the EBV reporter, demonstrating that the increased luciferase levels in the HPV system were not due to a direct effect of ORC2 shRNA on luciferase protein expression but reflective of PV copy number. ORC2 knockdown caused a ten-fold increase in HPV-16 DNA episome number measured by quantitative PCR with primers specific to the HPV-16 LCR. ORC2 silencing had no effect on the cell cycle profile at 48 hours. ORC2 depletion enhanced luciferase levels at 48 hours and increased HPV-31 DNA content significantly higher with ORC2 knockdown compared to the control at 72 hours. ORC2 is not necessary for HPV ori licensing, and E2 association might interfere with ORC2 function. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which PV E2 orchestrates the viral genome replication program in a stratifying epithelial environment.
Brucellosis is a common zoonotic disease that affects poor and marginalized populations, and is often found in Central Asia. In Dushanbe, Tajikistan, a study was conducted to investigate the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk. The study found that Brucella DNA was present in 10.3% of 564 cow milk samples, as determined by IS711-based real-time PCR. This is concerning because consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region. Brucella DNA was detected in the milk of all seropositive cows, but 8.3% of the seronegative cows also showed the presence of Brucella DNA. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggests that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B. melitensis. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the possibility of false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programs. Vaccination of cattle and small ruminants may be necessary to control Brucella infections in the livestock population. However, further research is required to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp. circulating among the livestock in this region.In conclusion, the study found that Brucella DNA was commonly detected in bovine milk in the UPU area of Dushanbe, both among Brucella seropositive and seronegative individuals. With a prevalence of 10.3%, the study suggests that the true number of Brucella-infected cattle in the study area may be underestimated by serology screening. False negative serology results and low antibody titers over time may contribute to the discrepancies between serology and qPCR results. Further research is needed to understand the circulating Brucella spp. among the livestock population, and to develop effective control and eradication strategies.
The stability of the genome is crucial for normal cell function and is linked to chromosome and DNA repair mechanisms stability. Many organisms have accessory or supernumerary chromosomes that differ from standard chromosomes. The fungus Zymoseptoria tritici has up to eight accessory chromosomes that are unstable, transcriptionally repressed, and enriched with repetitive elements and heterochromatic histone methylation marks. To understand the role of heterochromatin in genome stability in Z. tritici, researchers deleted the genes responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and studied the impact on chromosome and genome stability. The loss of H3K9me3 led to dramatic chromatin reorganization, genome rearrangements, and activation of transposable elements, while the loss of H3K27me3 increased the stability of accessory chromosomes. The study highlights the importance of H3K9me3 in maintaining genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 in constitutive heterochromatin regions and the role of H3K27me3 in reducing the stability of accessory chromosomes.
Rabies is a fatal disease preventable through post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but life-saving vaccines and biologicals are often inaccessible or unaffordable, particularly for the poorest sectors of society. Increasing accessibility, reducing costs, and preventing delays in delivering PEP should be prioritized. Analysis of different PEP vaccination regimens shows that switching from intramuscular (IM) administration of PEP to equally efficacious intradermal (ID) regimens could result in significant savings in vaccine volume required and costs. Financing mechanisms can help make PEP more affordable and accessible, supporting new and existing rabies control and prevention programs. A universal switch to ID delivery would improve affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, ultimately reducing human rabies deaths and being economical for healthcare providers.
Toxoplasma is an obligate intracellular parasite that replicates in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within mammalian cells. It has developed a mechanism to acquire nutrients by attracting host organelles to the PV, including lipid droplets (LD), which are ubiquitous fat storage organelles. Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. The number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes increase during infection, and Toxoplasma is capable of accessing and incorporating lipids from host LD into its own membranes and LD. This study highlights the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and the parasite’s capability in scavenging neutral lipids from host LD. In mammalian cells, LD consist of an organic core bounded by a monolayer of phospholipids with structural proteins, lipid biosynthetic enzymes, lipolytic enzymes, and membrane-trafficking proteins. LD are involved in various cellular processes, including energy storage, lipid homeostasis, cell signaling, inflammation, immunity, and RNA metabolism. Toxoplasma induces LD formation in host cells, and Toxoplasma-infected cells show changes in host LD abundance, intracellular distribution, and neutral lipid syntheses. Toxoplasma internalizes host LD into the PV and salvages their lipid content for incorporation into membranes or storage in its own LD. The attraction of host LD to the PV is a general phenotype of Toxoplasma infection in vitro. The progressive displacement of host LD to the PV and the increased expression of HsDGAT2 at the onset of parasite replication suggest that host LD may play a role in supporting the intracellular development of Toxoplasma.
Fasciolosis, a disease caused by liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, is an emerging zoonotic disease with increased human infections reported. Chemotherapy is the main control measure available, with triclabendazole being the preferred drug. However, resistance to triclabendazole has been reported in several countries, necessitating the search for new chemical entities and target molecules to control fluke infections. A study searched a library of forty flavonoid derivatives for inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases FhCL3 and FhCL1. Chalcones substituted with phenyl and naphtyl groups emerged as good cathepsin L inhibitors, with one compound, C34, tightly binding to juvenile specific FhCL3 with an IC50 of 5.6 μM. C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues, determining the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases. C34 reduces the larval ability to penetrate the gut wall and decreases NEJ's viability in vitro. This study is the first to screen non-peptidic inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsins and identifies chalcones as novel inhibitors of the two main Cathepsins secreted by juvenile and adult liver flukes. The findings open new avenues for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases.
The visual system uses separate neural pathways to transmit information about fast and slow changes in light intensity. Bipolar cells (BCs) play a crucial role in this process by transmitting signals from rod and cone photoreceptors through synaptic terminals of varying sizes. Researchers used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells transmit these signals to the inner retina. They discovered that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters. Individual cells transmit through multiple terminals varying in size, with smaller terminals generating faster and larger calcium transients, leading to quicker vesicle release with higher initial gain and more profound adaptation. Modeling global calcium dynamics indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to these differences in response dynamics, enabling one neuron to transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals with different adaptational properties. These findings reveal a mechanism through which multiple spatio-temporal filters are built using a limited number of neurons responding to a particular region of the visual field. By reconsidering the neural element through which the visual signal is transmitted to the inner retina, researchers can better understand how heterogeneous transmission of the visual signal reflects intrinsic variations between the various synaptic compartments of a BC.
A novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detecting synapses from multiplex fluorescence microscopy (muxFM) image data has been developed and tested, showing success in detecting synapses and accurately reproducing known features of cortical synapse distributions. This method, which uses a probabilistic model-based synapse detector that accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse, has been validated using human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth. The algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as effectively as human annotators, and can reproduce known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach has the potential to lead to relief from arbitrary threshold parameters and improvements in biological understanding of what defines a synapse. The proposed method has numerous advantages, including producing outputs in the form of probability maps, reflecting the limited certainty with which synapses can be detected, and the superior utility for both interactive and algorithmic exploration conferred by the query-based architecture resulting from the unsupervised framework. The method is not only unsupervised and more broadly applicable than existing methods, but it also outperforms them in cases where both methods can be used. The algorithm may also be useful for analysis of confocal and super-resolution FM images. This development is an important step towards deeper experimental analysis of the relationships between synaptic structure, molecules, and function, and can help to analyze volume images large enough to contain complete neural arbors, allowing discernment of the relationships between detected synapses and their presynaptic and postsynaptic parent neurons.
Zinc is a vital trace element involved in various cellular proteins' proper function, playing a key role in nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression regulation, signal transduction, cell division, immune and nervous system functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. Zinc homeostasis disruption can lead to human pathologies due to impaired cellular functions. Mammalian zinc transport is carried through two transporter families, ZnT and ZIP. The focus of this study is ZnT2, responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation. Although a proton gradient-dependent zinc transport has been suggested, it has not been conclusively established. This study aimed to model the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and demonstrate that ZnT2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter.ZnT2 was shown to have a critical role in the development and normal function of the mouse mammary gland, as well as in involution. Expanding the mechanistic understanding of ZnT2 function will provide valuable information with important physiological and possible therapeutic implications. The study used computational energy calculations and functional zinc transport assays to show that ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger. ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ion, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm.Understanding the mechanism of action and the proton-dependent zinc transport of ZnT2 is crucial due to its critical role in zinc homeostasis and the development and normal function of the mouse mammary gland. Expanding the mechanistic understanding of ZnT2 function will provide valuable information with important physiological and possible therapeutic implications.
Replication fork integrity and genome stability are maintained by checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events, with 14-3-3 proteins playing an undefined role under DNA replication stress. Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) processes stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells and interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in both yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, 14-3-3-deficient cells fail to induce Mec1-dependent Exo1 hyperphosphorylation, leading to Exo1-dependent ssDNA gaps at stalled forks and persistent checkpoint activation, causing recovery defects. 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. In mammalian cells, EXO1 activity is controlled by post-translational modifications such as ATR-dependent phosphorylation targeting EXO1 to ubiquitin-mediated degradation upon replication fork stalling. EXO1 deletion suppresses the sensitivity of rad53, but not mec1, mutant cells to agents causing reversible or irreversible stalling of replication forks. Eukaryotic 14-3-3 are highly conserved proteins that form flexible homo- and hetero-dimers, modulating the functions of proteins involved in various cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell-cycle. Upon DNA damage and DNA replication stress, 14-3-3 proteins are required for cell cycle restart, suppression of genomic instability, and viability. The exact mechanism of 14-3-3 action remains unknown, and further investigation is required to elucidate the role of 14-3-3 in regulating DNA replication stress response and fork stability.
The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis remains unclear, but studies in humanized mice have provided insight into their complex and often opposing roles. In acute HIV-1 infection, pDC are the critical IFN-I producer cells and contribute to suppressing HIV-1 replication. However, during chronic HIV-1 infection, pDC are still major IFN-I producers and help control HIV-1 replication, but their depletion during this phase surprisingly rescues human leukocytes, including CD4 T cells, in lymphoid organs despite higher levels of HIV-1 replication.A humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis was used to develop a pDC-specific mAb that specifically and efficiently depletes human pDC in various lymphoid organs. The study found that pDC play two opposing roles during HIV-1 infection: they produce IFN-I to inhibit HIV-1 replication, but also enhance HIV-1 pathogenesis by promoting cell death of human leukocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T cells.The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), a major site of human T-cell depletion by HIV-1 infection, is not structurally developed in humanized mouse models, making it difficult to examine the effect of pDC depletion in GALT in the current model. However, future studies examining the effect of pDC depletion in SIV-infected monkeys, which recapitulate GALT pathogenesis as in HIV-infected humans, could provide valuable insights.In addition to direct killing of HIV-1 infected CD4 cells, bystander cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells and uninfected human mature cells, are also depleted, associated with immune hyperactivation during pathogenic HIV-1 infection. Recent reports suggest that pDC may contribute to HIV-1 induced immune activation and subsequent immunopathogenesis. Persistent activation of pDC by HIV-1 infection in lymphoid organs contributes to HIV-1 immunopathogenesis by accelerating the death of all human leukocyte cells.In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that pDC play critical roles in both acute and chronic HIV-1 infection, and understanding their complex functions could lead to the development of novel strategies for treating HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment.
Sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to block HIV infection in macrophages, which play a critical role in HIV infection and pathogenesis. SFN is generated after mechanical damage to the vegetables, and reaches various tissues after consumption, where it maintains biological function. It is a powerful mobilizer of the transcription factor Nrf2, which is held in check by its constitutive degradation. SFN modifies KEAP1 to prevent engagement of Nrf2, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and initiate transcription from antioxidant response elements. Nrf2 activates several types of genes, predominantly those that counter oxidizing conditions. HIV infection has been shown to be blocked by SFN in myeloid-derived cells including primary macrophages, but not in primary T cells. SFN blocks infection after reverse transcription but before formation of 2-LTR circles. The anti-viral effect induced by SFN treatment is reversible and the SFN dose determines the duration over which the anti-viral state is maintained. These findings suggest that SFN may be a useful therapeutic alternative to support prevention and cure strategies for HIV.
A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in rural western Kenya to measure the prevalence of and identify risk factors for geohelminth infections among pregnant women. The study found that 76.2% of the 390 participants were infected with at least one geohelminth: 52.3% with Ascaris lumbricoides, 39.5% with hookworm, and 29.0% with Trichuris trichiura. Infection with at least one geohelminth species was associated with the use of an unprotected water source and the lack of treatment of drinking water. Geohelminth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or low body mass index, but a hookworm infection with an egg count ≥1000/gram feces was associated with lower hemoglobin. Among gravidae 2 and 3, women with A. lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia compared to women without A. lumbricoides. Geohelminth infections are common in this pregnant population, but there were few observed detrimental effects. Routine provision of antihelminth treatment during an antenatal clinic visit is recommended, but an evaluation of the impact on pregnancy, malaria, and birth outcome is useful. Geohelminth infections are a major global health burden, with an estimated 3.8 billion persons infected and an estimated 135,000 deaths attributed to clinical complications annually. Geohelminth infections in pregnancy have been associated with iron deficiency, maternal anemia, and impaired nutritional status, as well as decreased infant birth weight, intra-uterine growth retardation, and adverse birth outcomes. However, effects of geohelminths among pregnant women may differ by area and helminth burden.
Mycolactone is a macrolide produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, which causes Buruli ulcer disease. It has cytotoxic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. A recent study showed that mycolactone blocks the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells by affecting the Sec61-dependent production. This study aimed to investigate the effects of mycolactone on the inflammatory responses of the nervous cell subsets involved in pain perception, transmission, and maintenance, as well as its impact on neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain. The study found that prolonged exposure to mycolactone induced significant cell death at concentrations >10 ng/ml in sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia. However, nanomolar concentrations of mycolactone efficiently suppressed the cell production of pro-inflammatory mediators without affecting their viability within the first 24h of treatment. Mycolactone also prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia. In vivo, mycolactone decreased significantly the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity in a rat model of neuropathic pain. The study suggests that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may, at least partially, be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.
Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne disease endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and caused by two sub-species of trypanosomes. In West Africa, Guinea has the highest prevalence of HAT, especially in the mangrove areas of coastal Guinea, where the vector, the tsetse fly Glossina palpalis gambiensis, is abundant. HAT caused by T. b. gambiense is classically described as a chronic disease, but asymptomatic carriers and spontaneous cure without treatment have been reported. A recent long-term longitudinal survey in Côte d'Ivoire found people who were initially diagnosed by microscopy but on follow-up examination, up to 15 years later, had no detectable parasitaemia by microscopy. These individuals were classified as latent infections, i.e., able to control blood parasitaemia at very low levels. Many factors could play a role in this variability of response to infection, including genetic polymorphism of the parasite and host genetic factors involved in the control of immunity. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IFNG, APOL1, TNFA, HPR, HLA-G, HLA-A, HP, and MIF genes on susceptibility/resistance to HAT by means of an association study between HAT cases, seropositive microscopically aparasitaemic subjects with latent infections, and controls.The study was performed as part of a medical survey conducted by the national control program according to the national HAT diagnostic procedures and was approved by the Ministry of Health in Guinea. Blood was collected from 425 individuals living in three active HAT foci in the mangrove areas of coastal Guinea and classified into three phenotypes: HAT cases or active HAT patients, latent infections, and endemic controls. DNA was extracted from buffy coat samples and 80 SNPs were selected for genotyping using two strategies. After quality control and filtering, 28 SNPs were remaining and used for association analysis. Association analysis's were done using pairwise comparison between cases-controls, cases-latent infections, and latent infections-controls.The results showed that the A allele of IL6 rs1818879 and the G allele of APOL1 G1 appear to be associated with a higher risk of developing a latent infection but a lower risk of progressing from latent infection with undetectable parasitaemia to active disease. The APOL1 G2 allele increased the risk of progressing from latent infection to active HAT. The associations with the APOL1 G1 and G2 polymorphisms confirm previous observations, and the alleles seem to provide some degree of protection for individuals with latent infections. IL6 rs1818879 A allele carriers had a lower risk of developing the disease. These findings suggest that the genetic diversity of the hosts plays a role in the clinical diversity of sleeping sickness. The study was performed as part of the larger multi-country TrypanoGEN consortium study and aimed to understand the genetic basis of human susceptibility to trypanosomiasis.
The Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP) involved whole-genome sequencing of 38 Singapore Indians with a target coverage of 30X, comparing their genetic structure and diversity to other Asian populations and the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). SSIP samples exhibited higher intra-population genetic diversity and heterozygosity than other Asian populations, and were genetically close to South Indians. However, eight SSIP samples belonged to European-predominant mitochondrial haplogroups and showed elevated European admixture, indicating complex ancestry. This resource will aid in understanding the genetic architecture of Asian Indians.Meanwhile, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized genomics by enabling comprehensive cataloging of genetic variants in a cost-effective way. NGS allows for sequencing of multiple individuals in a population to identify genetic variations, including Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion-deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs). The 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) aims to sequence over 2,500 individuals from 20 populations, providing valuable insights into the population genetics of 14 populations through a multi-individual, low-sequence-depth approach.In South Asia, NGS has been utilized in the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project (SSMP) and the SSIP. The SSMP, which examined the merits of deep sequencing for more comprehensive variant characterization, sequenced 100 Austronesian Malays at a coverage of at least 30X. The Indian subcontinent, home to over 20% of the world's population, has a complex demographic history shaped by migrations and interactions since the first human dispersal out of Africa. Ancient admixture analyses, mitochondrial sequence analyses, and genome-wide genotyping surveys have provided insights into the admixture and ethno-linguistic influences in the Indian subcontinent.The SSIP provides whole-genome sequencing of 38 Singapore Indians, yielding a high-quality resource for genetic studies of Asian Indians. Upon quality control and filtering, a total of 10,305,409 SNPs, 1,269,000 indels, and 56,088 large deletions were discovered, demonstrating novelty and ethnic diversity. Pathway analysis identified significant enrichment in pathways related to olfactory transduction, ATP-bind cassette (ABC) transporters, and Histidine metabolism. Further investigation of the loss-of-function variants and their association with diseases and phenotypes highlights the potential impact of genetic variation on health and disease. Therefore, the SSIP represents a significant contribution to understanding the diversity and genetic architecture of global populations and provides a valuable resource for understanding disease susceptibility and treatment response in Asian Indians.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a significant health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. The bacteria's intrinsic resistance to various antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and macrolides, complicates treatment. This resistance is primarily due to the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump. However, some strains, such as 708a, 2188a, and 3799a, from Northeast Thailand, exhibit susceptibility to these antibiotics. The study found that the aminoglycoside susceptibility of strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a is due to the absence or reduced expression of AmrAB-OprA. In strain 708a, this is due to a large chromosome 1 deletion of approximately 131 kb, which includes the amrAB-oprA operon and other genes implicated in virulence and bacterial pathogenesis. Despite missing several putative virulence genes, strain 708a was fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. Strain 708a, therefore, presents a natural candidate for genetic manipulation experiments using Select Agent compliant antibiotics for selection, validating the use of laboratory-constructed Δ(amrAB-oprA) mutants in such experiments.
In eukaryotic development, the induction of lineage-specific transcription factors drives the differentiation of multipotent progenitor cells while repressing alternative lineages, often mediated by extracellular signaling molecules like cytokines. A study of CD4 T helper (Th) cell differentiation into Th1 versus Th2 states revealed that, contrary to mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, these factors are co-expressed in individual cells at high levels, and cytokines are expressed only in a small subpopulation of cells, with cell-to-cell variation significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. This early differentiation process of CD4 T cells results in a mixed Th1/Th2 state, instructed by extracellular cytokines, with an interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components as a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.
The paqr-2 gene in C. elegans, which encodes a protein with seven transmembrane domains similar to the mammalian adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, is essential for adaptation to low temperatures. A mutation in paqr-2 impairs the ability of C. elegans to grow and reproduce at 15°C, and this mutation also results in an abnormal fatty acid composition, an excess of lipid droplets, and is synthetic lethal with loss-of-function mutations in genes that promote fatty acid turnover. By using an unbiased forward genetic approach, a novel regulatory pathway connecting paqr-2, phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, and the regulation of fatty acid desaturation to increase membrane fluidity during cold adaptation was established. Three paqr-2 suppressors are gain-of-function alleles of nhr-49, a nuclear hormone receptor homologous to the mammalian HNF4 and with activities that are sometimes compared to that of PPARα, while two other paqr-2 suppressor mutations are loss-of-function alleles of the genes ech-7 and hacd-1, which encode enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. The remaining three paqr-2 suppressor mutations are loss-of-function alleles of pcyt-1 and cept-1, which are enzymes important for PC synthesis. These paqr-2 suppressors, as well as the previously identified partial suppressors aak-2 and nhr-80, are all involved in PC synthesis and fatty acid metabolism, and they likely increase unsaturated fatty acids to compensate for the paqr-2 mutation. An analysis of the fatty acid composition of PCs, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and triacylglycerols (TAGs) in synchronized wild-type, paqr-2 mutants, and paqr-2 mutants carrying suppressor mutations showed that paqr-2 mutants have an abnormally high abundance of saturated fatty acids, and that suppression of the paqr-2 phenotypes is associated with an increased abundance of unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, the nhr-49 (et8) and cept-1 (et10) mutations normalized the overall PE/PC ratio in the paqr-2 mutant, suggesting that the paqr-2 mutant may compensate for an inability to upregulate fatty acid unsaturation by increasing the PE/PC ratio. Modulating the PE/PC ratio has important effects on membrane dynamics since PEs are bilayer-destabilizing phospholipids. Genetic interaction experiments suggest that nhr-49 (et8) and cept-1 (et10) likely act on a common target to suppress the paqr-2 phenotypes. Since nhr-49 is a well-established promoter of fatty acid desaturation, it is tentatively concluded that this is also the essential outcome of the cept-1 (et10) mutation. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of fatty acid metabolism during cold adaptation and tail tip maintenance in C. elegans.
Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is a well-studied virus with a large, double-stranded DNA genome contained within an icosahedral capsid, a pleomorphic proteinaceous layer called the tegument, and a glycoprotein-containing lipid envelope. The portal vertex, located at the twelfth vertex of the icosahedron, is believed to be the site of DNA packaging and release. A study using electron cryo-tomography of HSV-1 virions revealed a unique feature at the portal vertex that extends across the tegument layer and forms a connection between the capsid and the viral membrane. This assembly, called the portal vertex-associated tegument (PVAT), is a set of proteins that are consistently arranged with respect to the portal vertex and are continuous with the heterogeneous surrounding tegument. The detection of the PVAT is difficult due to its presence at only one vertex and its surrounding of inconsistently arranged tegument material. However, using sensitive methods, the PVAT was visualized and aligning each subtomogram based on its density distribution meant that the PVAT density was reinforced in the final reconstruction. The PVAT is likely to play a role in docking the capsid to the nuclear pore complex and signalling the proper conditions for release of the viral DNA, similar to the function of the tail in tailed bacteriophages. The composition of the PVAT cannot be directly determined from the reconstructions, but it is likely to include proteins such as pUL25 and pUL36 which have been shown to have roles in NPC recognition and DNA release.
Parasitic helminths like Schistosoma mansoni can modify human immune responses by skewing and dampening them, which could have implications for HIV-1 transmission and disease progression. A study examined the effects of soluble egg antigen (SEA) from S. mansoni on modulating HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro. The study found that SEA, specifically through kappa-5, can bind to DC-SIGN and block DC-SIGN mediated HIV-1 trans-infection, while not interfering with cis-infection. DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2 promoting conditions, upon co-culture with naïve T-cells, induce a T-cell population that is less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection, but not to X4 virus infection. This was not observed for DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th1 or Th1/Th2 promoting conditions. The T-cell populations induced by SEA exposed DCs demonstrate a reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ and MIP-1β. The infection profile of T-cells infected with HIV-1 R5 was not associated with down-modulation of CCR5 cell surface expression. These results suggest that SEA parasite antigens and specifically rω-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity and have the potential to influence disease course in co-infected individuals.
Neuronal stimulation leads to a 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in both gray and white matter. This shrinkage phenomenon is closely linked to potassium clearance and water transport processes. Despite its potential implications for understanding basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, it remains unexplained. A dynamic model has been developed to account for current experimental data related to this shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model suggests that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane are sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage. However, the Na+/K+/Cl- (NKCC1) and the Na+/HCO3- (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. The model provides a framework for guiding future key experiments and paving the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal and pathophysiological situations. Astrocytes, first discovered in the mid 19th century, are star-shaped neuroglial cells that constitute the most abundant type of macroglia in the brain. They were once considered passive bystanders of neural activity, but are now known to be critically involved in modulating excitatory and inhibitory synapses, maintaining extracellular K+, H+, and glutamate levels, supplying energy substrates for neurons, and interacting with the vasculature to form functional compartments controlling communication pathways. Dysfunctional astrocytes have been linked to various central nervous system disorders, including neuropathic pain, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. Despite the importance of astrocytes in neural function and pathology, our understanding of their normal behavioral repertoire is limited, particularly regarding the mechanisms underlying ECS shrinkage.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, transposable elements and other repetitive DNA elements are kept in check through transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms, which involve small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by the RNase III enzyme Dicer. These siRNAs provide sequence specificity for effector complexes that mediate RNA cleavage and/or the establishment of repressive chromatin modifications at target loci. Transcriptional silencing of transposable elements is achieved through the RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing (RITS) pathway, which is initiated by the recognition of target loci by AGO4-siRNA complexes. This recognition requires sequence identity between siRNAs and the genomic loci, and it is hypothesized to occur through base-pair interactions with DNA or nascent RNA transcripts. Recent studies have suggested that in Arabidopsis, RNA Polymerase V (Pol V) produces non-coding transcripts in otherwise silent chromatin, and its activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of repressive chromatin modifications. These Pol V-produced non-coding transcripts physically interact with AGO4 and recruit siRNA-AGO4 complexes to their targets, and the transcriptional silencing of several loci needs AGO4 slicer activity, suggesting that in plants siRNAs may recognize their targets by base-pair interactions with Pol V transcripts. However, it is still unclear how siRNAs work with Pol V transcripts, AGO4, and other proteins to recruit chromatin modifying enzymes to their target loci in chromatin. SPT5L is a homolog of SPT5 Pol II-associated elongation factor and has been shown to interact with AGO4, RNA, and Pol V complex. It has been hypothesized that SPT5L works downstream of Pol V and recruits AGO4 to Pol V-transcribed loci. IGN5, IGN6, and AtSN1 are Pol V-transcribed loci that require both Pol V and SPT5L for DNA methylation. SPT5L does not work upstream of Pol V in the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway, and Pol V is needed for SPT5L protein stability. SPT5L and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and at least partially independently of each other, and both are needed for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at several loci. SPT5L binding to chromatin is not affected by the rdr2 mutation, suggesting that RDR2-dependent siRNA is not required for SPT5L binding to chromatin. SPT5L and AGO4 are both guided by interactions with Pol V complex and/or Pol V transcripts. The parallel and independent recruitment of SPT5L and AGO4 to chromatin suggests that at Pol V-transcribed loci, none of them is sufficient for the establishment and maintenance of silent chromatin modifications. At least at a subset of loci, SPT5L and AGO4 work together to recruit repressive chromatin modifications, including DNA methylation and H3K9me2. The locus-specific function of SPT5L affects not only DNA methylation but also H3K9me2 and H3Ac. However, the pool of AGO4 that is bound to chromatin in an SPT5L-dependent manner is not required for silencing, suggesting that AGO4 and SPT5L are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other. Our findings establish the order of events leading to siRNA-mediated establishment of transcriptional silencing, including the recognition of silencing targets and the production of two classes of non-coding RNAs: siRNAs and Pol V-transcribed non-coding RNAs. Pol V recruitment to chromatin and transcription is followed by the association of AGO4 and SPT5L with chromatin. SPT5L binds chromatin independently of 24-nt siRNA and is likely a general factor associated with transcribing Pol V and its transcripts.
The RpoS regulon, controlled by the alternative sigma factor RpoS, is crucial for the transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi) by feeding nymphs. RpoS-deficient organisms are unable to traverse the midgut and infect distant sites in mice, although they replicate at normal levels during the nymphal blood meal. The aberrant morphology of RpoS-deficient spirochetes, referred to as round bodies or cysts, can be attributed to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase in vitro. These findings suggest that RpoS plays a significant role in the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission and triggers a default survival mode, round body formation, when spirochetes cannot produce sufficient energy for dissemination within the nymph. This highlights the importance of understanding the spirochete's transcriptome within ticks, which is currently not technically feasible. Therefore, qRT-PCR was used to measure transcript levels for a panel of RpoS-dependent genes, revealing that all eight genes previously shown to be absolutely RpoS-dependent in DMC-cultivated spirochetes were induced during nymphal feeding. Overall, these findings indicate that genes whose expression is upregulated by RpoS are likely to be expressed both during and after transmission by nymphs, while RpoS-dependent repression appears to occur only after spirochetes have fully adapted to the mammalian host.
In Arabidopsis, the precise coordination of stamen and pistil development is crucial for fertile flower formation. The development of stamen is regulated by various genes and hormones, including gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA). Mutations affecting the biosynthesis of GA and JA cause male sterility due to impaired stamen filament elongation and anthesis. GA and JA play a hierarchical role in controlling stamen development, where GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57. These MYB genes are downregulated in the ga1-3 single mutant and the sterile quadruple mutant ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 (loss-of-function of GAI, RGA, RGL1 three DELLA genes but RGL2 is normal), but restored to wild type levels in the fertile penta mutant ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 rgl2-2 (loss-of-function of GAI, RGA, RGL1 and RGL2 four DELLA genes). The absence of the four DELLAs (GAI, RGA, RGL1 and RGL2) cannot suppress the short stamen phenotype conferred by the loss-of-function of MYB21 and MYB24. The application of exogenous JA onto the ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 rgl2-1 quadruple mutant flower buds could restore the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, whereas application of exogenous GA onto opr3 mutant flower buds failed to increase the expression of these three MYBs. GA upregulates JA-biosynthetic genes DAD1 and LOX1 and the JA content in the young flower buds of the GA-deficient quadruple mutant ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 is much lower than that in the WT and penta mutant. Therefore, it is established that GA upregulates the DAD1 and LOX1 expression to promote JA production to promote the expression of the three MYBs necessary for stamen filament development.
Dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to extend lifespan in various species and slow the onset of age-related diseases. A conserved protein kinase known as the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is essential for longevity phenotypes resulting from DR. TOR regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth factors. A transcription factor complex known as HIF-1, which plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response, is one of the targets of the TOR pathway in mammalian cells. A study in Caenorhabditis elegans found that HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with that by inhibition of the RSKS-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the TOR pathway. The hif-1 loss-of-function mutant extends lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but fails to show lifespan extension under DR. A mutation in egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminishes the lifespan extension under DR, and this deficiency is rescued by tissue-specific expression of egl-9 in specific neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by hif-1 or DR is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress. Therefore, the study demonstrates a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway. DR has been shown to extend lifespan in various species, and identification of genes involved in DR response will provide potential targets for treatments of age-associated diseases and the extension of healthful lifespan in humans.
In studying the chromatin changes and gene expression programs during transitions of progenitor keratinocytes to differentiation and migration, it was found that unique complements of enhancers (regulatory regions distant from target promoters) are formed in each state. These enhancers are classified as typical enhancers (TES) or super-enhancers (SEs), with the latter being longer and associated with higher levels of cooperatively binding transcription factors and H3K27Ac activation marks. SEs are more important for cell type specifications and driving the expression of cell identity genes than TES. In the case of GRHL3, a single transcription factor that promotes both differentiation and migration of keratinocytes, it regulates divergent gene expression programs under different physiological states within the same cell type by switching locations of chromatin binding in the context of enhancer landscapes that are distinct for each state. Specifically, GRHL3 binds to distal regulatory regions during keratinocyte differentiation and to promoters during keratinocyte migration, while repressing the expression of migration inhibitors during migration. SEs are enriched for skin disease sequence variants, and GRHL3 binds preferentially to SEs in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters in migrating keratinocytes. Many key epidermal differentiation transcription factor genes, including GRHL3, are located within SEs, and these transcription factors in turn bind to and regulate SEs. GRHL3 also represses the formation of progenitor and non-keratinocyte SEs in differentiating keratinocytes. Therefore, chromatin relocates GRHL3 binding and enhancers to regulate both the irreversible commitment of progenitor keratinocytes to differentiation and their reversible transition to migration.
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections of the host germline, passed down vertically from generation to generation. In sheep, two exogenous (horizontally transmitted) oncogenic retroviruses, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus and Enzootic nasal tumor virus, coexist with highly related and biologically active endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs). Sheep are an interesting model to study retrovirus-host coevolution due to this unique coexistence. A study of 27 enJSRV proviruses revealed that two of them, enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20, acquired a defective Gag polyprotein in two temporally distinct events, resulting in a transdominant phenotype that blocks late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses. These transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication (∼9,000 years ago). This suggests that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections. Exogenous retroviruses occasionally infect the germ cells of their hosts, resulting in stably integrated endogenous retroviruses that are passed on to subsequent generations. ERVs can interfere with exogenous retroviruses by various mechanisms, such as the expression of envelope (Env) glycoproteins that block viral entry of exogenous retroviruses by receptor competition. Sheep offer a unique opportunity to study the coevolution of ERVs, exogenous retroviruses, and their hosts.
The study evaluates the performance of Schistosoma PCRs in diagnosing schistosomiasis, compared to microscopy and serological assays. The Schistosoma PCRs were performed on 412 samples from patients with suspected schistosomiasis, targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium. The results showed that PCRs significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis for Sh in urine and Sm in stools, and for serum samples, the overall sensitivity was 72.7%, with a specificity of 98.9%. After treatment, serum PCR positivity rates declined slowly, while antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. The study suggests that Schistosoma PCRs could be part of the reference methods combined with WB-based serology, and when serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative, serum PCRs provide species information to guide further clinical exploration. Biomarkers such as DNA and antibodies are of limited relevance for early treatment monitoring, but serum PCR could be useful when performed at least 1 year after treatment to help confirm a cured infection. Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne parasitic disease of great concern worldwide, with a growing number of people potentially infected in non-endemic areas. The development of molecular methods has encouraged research on Schistosoma DNA detection, which appears to be a promising, highly sensitive, and specific tool for diagnosing schistosomiasis.
The use of machine learning for estimating potential energy surfaces has been demonstrated to speed up molecular dynamics simulations for small systems, and this approach has been shown to be feasible for larger, structurally complex molecules, using the natural product Archazolid A as an example. A model was developed to estimate energies of new conformations using Gaussian process regression and predictive variance to assess whether a conformation is in the interpolation region, allowing for a controlled trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed-up. The model achieved mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol for energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional level of theory. This study demonstrates the potential for developing predictive machine learning models for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, enabling considerable speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures.Archazolid A is a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase and has a complex structure, including a 24-membered macrolactone ring with seven alkenes and eight methyl- and hydroxyl-bearing stereocenters. The relative and absolute stereochemistry and three in-solution model conformations were elucidated using NMR spectroscopic methods. The model was trained using a series of computationally expensive QM calculations, with the underlying assumption that similar chemical systems have similar properties. The model used a simple matrix representation based on nuclear charges and intra-molecular distances for the simulated system.Semi-empirical MD simulations were carried out using the AM1 Hamiltonian, starting with a model of Archazolid A minimized with NMR constraints. Four trajectories of 300 ps length were calculated using an NVT ensemble with a Berendsen heat bath coupling constant of 40 fs and the velocity Verlet integrator. Snapshots were recorded every 100 fs, and the initial 50 ps of each trajectory were discarded to ensure equilibration. A total of 1000 equally distributed conformers from the four trajectories were energy minimized using MOPAC2012 at the AM1 level. The resulting structures were further optimized using DFT-D2 calculations with TURBOMOLE and single point calculations on the BLYP (RI)-D3-COSMO/def2-TZVP level for direct comparison of MD snapshots and experimental data.The study demonstrated that the MD simulations sampled relevant conformations of the central macrocyclic structure, as the generated conformers possessed favorable energies and similar compliance with experimental data as the literature-reported conformations 5a, 5b, and nmr. A total of 2,800 diverse conformers were generated using the MMFF94x FF, which were clustered with respect to geometric measurements of the macrolactone ring. The results showed that about 40% of the FF-based structures were in clusters containing no QM-based conformers and vice versa. Therefore, only DFT-D energies were considered for further study.Gaussian processes, a non-parametric regression method with regularization, were used to train ML models to capture the relationship between the relaxed Archazolid A conformations sampled from the MD simulation and their DFT-D3 energies. The ML models were trained using a simple matrix representation based on nuclear charges and inter-atomic distances. The results showed a root mean squared error of 5.35±0.72 kJ/mol, mean absolute error of 3.51±0.38 kJ/mol, and squared correlation coefficient of R2=0.88±0.03. These results suggest that GP regression, a Bayesian non-parametric ML method, is suited for modeling relationships between molecular structure and QM properties even for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds.
"In Central Africa, a ""hotspot"" for emerging infectious diseases, an outbreak of ebolavirus is currently affecting multiple countries and suspected to have caused recent declines in resident great apes. While ebolavirus vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved with diagnostic confirmation of EVD as the cause of die-offs, establishing ebolavirus geographical distribution, identifying immunologically naïve populations, and determining if apes survive virus exposure. A new approach of noninvasive detection of antibodies against EBOV in wild ape feces has been developed, identifying gorillas with antibodies to EBOV at a prevalence rate of 10%, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. This new approach will contribute to protecting apes from future EBOV infections and have a profound impact on public health in local communities by identifying great ape outbreaks and preventing human pathogens of animal origin from reaching a pandemic state."
Type III effectors are virulence factors used by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens to manipulate host cell processes, including innate immunity and gene expression. A novel type III effector XopL from the model plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, both in vitro and in planta. This activity is associated with the C-terminal region of XopL, which specifically interacts with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates formation of predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of the XopL C-terminal domain revealed a single domain with a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in any previously characterized E3 ligase. The E3 ligase activity is required for XopL-induced plant cell death, while suppression of PAMP responses solely depends on the N-terminal LRR domain. The unique structural fold of the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain within XopL highlights the variation in bacterial pathogen effectors mimicking this eukaryote-specific activity.
The RV254 cohort was used to study T helper- B cell responses in acute HIV infection and the impact of early antiretroviral treatment (ART) on T and B cell function. The function of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh) from this cohort was examined, and cTfh and memory B cell populations were phenotyped. Impaired cTfh cell function was observed in individuals treated in stage 3 when compared to stage 1/2. This coincided with lower IL-10 and increased RANTES and TNF-α, suggesting a role for inflammation in altering cTfh and B cell responses. Elevated plasma viral load in stage 3 was found to correlate with decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production, indicating a role for increased viremia in cTfh impairment and dysfunctional humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were also evident in the mature B cell compartment, most notably a decrease in resting memory B cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with higher viremia. These data suggest that early ART for acutely HIV infected individuals could prevent immune dysregulation while preserving cTfh function and B cell memory. This is important as antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been pivotal in reducing the viral burden in persons infected with HIV, but the concurrent decline in the HIV-specific T and B cell memory response poses a great risk, as treatment interruption can lead to a loss in the control of viremia. The need to identify immune parameters that are associated with preservation of the memory response during HIV infection is therefore important to providing clues for therapies going forward.
Schistosomiasis, a tropical parasitic disease affecting approximately 200 million people worldwide, is currently treated with the drug praziquantel (PZQ). However, the drug has several less than ideal features, such as lack of understanding of its mechanism, inability to improve it through chemical derivatization, inability to kill all parasitic life cycle stages, and sub-optimal cure rates in the field. To address these issues, researchers have been looking for new drug targets. One potential target is a schistosome serotonergic G protein coupled receptor (Sm. 5HTR) that has been shown to be involved in the efficacy of PZQ. In a recent study, the researchers profiled the Sm. 5HTR using a miniaturized screening assay compatible with high content screening. The assay uses a split luciferase based biosensor that is sensitive to cellular cAMP levels and resolves the proximal kinetics of GPCR modulation in intact cells. The results showed a divergent pharmacological signature between the parasitic serotonergic receptor and the closest human GPCR homolog (Hs. 5HTR7), supporting the feasibility of optimizing parasitic selective pharmacophores. New ligands and chemical series with potency and selectivity for Sm. 5HTR over Hs. 5HTR7 were identified in vitro and validated for in vivo efficacy against schistosomules and adult worms. The study suggests that Sm. 5HTR is a promising target for the development of next generation anthelmintics.
"Gastrulation, a crucial step in the development of many organisms, involves the formation of the three germ layers - ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm - and their organization into the basic body structure. The separation of these germ layers has been traditionally explained by the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, which suggests that adhesion differences between cell populations lead to their separation and positioning. However, recent studies have shown that the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary serves not only to keep these germ layers separated but also as a substratum for mesoderm migration and as a site for tissue separation. This mechanism relies on localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle that allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum.The separation of the ectoderm and mesoderm has been studied extensively in Xenopus, where the boundary between these two germ layers, Brachet's cleft, must permit mesoderm movement yet prevent invasion of the ectoderm. The molecular control of separation behavior is partly known and involves non-canonical Wnt signaling, interaction of Xfz7 with paraxial protocadherin and with the ankyrin repeat domain protein 5, and activation of RhoA and Rho kinase. A candidate for the proximal mechanism that generates the boundary is ephrin/Eph signaling. This signaling pathway involves Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, which are subdivided into EphA and EphB subclasses, and their membrane-linked ephrin ligands. Within subclasses, binding appears promiscuous, and receptor ligation and clustering initiate ""forward signaling,"" while receptor-ligand interaction can also stimulate ""reverse signaling"" downstream of the ephrin ligand.Ephrin/Eph signaling has been implicated in boundary formation, and experiments have shown that it can regulate cell adhesion, migration, and sorting in the early Xenopus embryo. Furthermore, the behavior of ectodermal and mesodermal cells at the boundary has been observed in living tissues, and results indicate that contact-induced detachment between ectodermal and mesodermal cells is at the base of a tissue separation mechanism supportive of cell movement at the interface.Experiments in an in vitro assay have shown that ephrinB-Fc treatment of ectoderm tissues causes tissue separation, indicating that an EphB receptor is present on ectodermal cells and that its stimulation by ephrinB can immediately induce tissue separation. These results suggest that increasing ephrinB levels is sufficient to trigger separation and that the differences in ephrin composition between ectodermal and mesodermal tissues play a role in the formation of the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary. Further studies are needed to fully understand the role of ephrin/Eph signaling in tissue separation and the mechanisms underlying this process."
The number of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) cases has increased significantly over the past four decades, with diagnoses currently based on behavioral observations and psychometric tools due to limited biological knowledge. However, the inclusion of biochemical data in ASD diagnosis is expected to enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses. A study analyzing metabolite concentrations from the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways in blood samples of 83 participants with ASD and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers demonstrated the potential of this approach. Using Fisher Discriminant Analysis and kernel partial least squares, the study achieved a 96.1% correct classification rate for neurotypical participants and a 97.6% rate for the ASD cohort, outperforming previous methods. These results indicate a strong correlation between the metabolites under consideration and an ASD diagnosis, and highlight the potential of statistical analysis techniques for extracting valuable information from complex biochemical datasets. ASD is a group of early-onset neurological diseases characterized by social communication/interaction difficulties and expression of restricted repetitive behaviors and interests. Twin studies suggest a heritability of 37-55% for ASD, and environmental factors such as maternal/paternal age, toxic chemical exposure, and maternal rubella infection are also emerging as key contributors to ASD liability. Despite the strong genetic association, only 15% of ASD cases have a known genetic source. Abnormalities in folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transsulfuration (TS) contribute to the genetic and environmental predisposition to ASD, with several genes in these pathways associated with increased ASD risk. Environmental toxins such as prenatal valproate use, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and air pollutants have also been linked to ASD predisposition. Identifying biomarkers supporting the diagnosis process is an ongoing area of research, with FOCM/TS dysfunction being a potential contributor to ASD etiology. Advanced modeling and statistical analysis tools can help distinguish ASD from neurotypical participants based on FOCM/TS metabolites and reveal strong correlations between metabolite concentrations and adaptive behavior.
Leishmaniasis, a group of tropical diseases, affects 350 million people in 98 countries, with an estimated 2 million cases annually. Brazil is one of the most severely affected countries. A study used Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models to analyze reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil from 2001-2010. The study identified climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic risk factors, with precipitation and socioeconomic proxies being the most important for both types of leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (SD: 7,676) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 (SD: 288) for visceral leishmaniasis. The study's risk maps can help prioritize intervention areas and optimize resource allocation for control and elimination efforts.
Dengue has emerged as the most significant mosquito-borne viral illness worldwide, with an estimated 50 million symptomatic infections occurring annually. While traditionally affecting children, recent trends show an increase in hospitalization of young adults in Southeast Asia. This shift can be attributed to factors such as socioeconomic development, improved vector control, and changes in birth and death rates. Reports suggest that adults experience unusual complications with high mortality, including acute liver failure, encephalopathy, myocarditis, and acute renal failure, more frequently than children.A comparative study conducted in southern Vietnam between 2006 and 2008 analyzed 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue. The study found that children had more frequent and severe signs of vascular leakage and shock, while bleeding manifestations and organ involvement were more common in adults. Adults also experienced significantly more severe thrombocytopenia. Secondary infection increased thrombocytopenia in both age groups, but adults had a smaller effect due to their intrinsically lower platelet counts compared to children. These findings highlight the importance of understanding age-related differences in dengue cases for developing appropriate management guidelines.In conclusion, the epidemiology of dengue is evolving, with a growing number of young adults requiring hospitalization. As the disease dynamics change, it is crucial to consider age-related differences in clinical presentation and disease progression to improve patient care and outcomes.
In contrast to HIV infection in humans and SIV in macaques, SIV infection in its natural host, the sooty mangabey (SM), is non-pathogenic despite robust virus replication. A novel SM CCR5 allele containing a two base pair deletion (Δ2) encoding a truncated molecule that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro has been identified in SM. This allele was present at a 26% frequency in a large SM colony, along with 3% for a CCR5Δ24 deletion allele. Overall, 8% of animals were homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles and 41% were heterozygous. The prevalence of natural SIVsmm infection was not significantly different in animals lacking functional CCR5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type animals. Furthermore, animals lacking functional CCR5 had robust plasma viral loads, which were only modestly lower than wild-type animals. SIVsmm primary isolates infected both homozygous mutant and wild-type PBMC in a CCR5-independent manner in vitro. These data indicate that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in SM and raises the possibility of novel CCR5-negative target cells that may be more expendable than CCR5+ cells and enable the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of extremely restricted CCR5 expression seen in SM and several other natural host species. HIV and SIV entry into target cells is initiated by binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) to cell surface CD4, followed by structural changes that enable interactions with a seven transmembrane G protein coupled cell surface receptor that then triggers fusion. HIV-1 isolates use CCR5 or CXCR4 or both, and in vitro use other molecules infrequently. The restricted expression of CCR5 mainly on memory CD4+ T cells, but broader expression of CXCR4 on both memory and naïve subsets, is thought in part to underlie the accelerated disease progression seen in individuals in whom CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants emerge late in the course of infection. In contrast, SIV strains use CCR5 almost universally and very rarely use CXCR4. Sooty mangabeys express very low levels of CCR5 on their CD4+ T cells, a mechanism by which replication might be regulated in vivo and restrict transmission and pathogenesis. However, most strains of SIV use a number of other alternative coreceptors in vitro, such as CXCR6, the orphan receptors GPR1 and GPR15, and several others. Despite the efficient use of such alternative entry pathways by SIVmac and SIVsmm isolates in transfected cells, infection and cell targeting in vivo is generally thought to be dependent on CCR5. Notably, the proportion of CD4+ T cells depleted and/or infected at a given time in macaques and mangabeys may exceed the proportion of cells with detectable CCR5 expression, raising the possibility that other pathways in addition to CCR5 might be utilized.
MEF2, a family of transcriptional regulators, can have both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities depending on interacting partners. In leiomyosarcomas (LMS), MEF2's two-faced trait is relevant for tumor aggressiveness. Class IIa HDACs are overexpressed in 22% of LMS, and high levels of MEF2, HDAC4, and HDAC9 inversely correlate with overall survival. The knockout of HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells. HDAC9 coordinates the demethylation of H3K4me3 at the promoters of MEF2-target genes. Class IIa HDACs do not bind all the regulative elements bound by MEF2, allowing for the coexistence of actively transcribed and strongly repressed MEF2-target genes in the same cell. These findings suggest that class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, can be druggable targets for therapeutic intervention in LMS.
Hydrophobins are important proteins produced by filamentous fungi, with both biological and nanotechnological relevance. They affect the environment to promote fungal growth through their unique properties at interfaces. A study using protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy was conducted to analyze the surface structure of films composed of two class II hydrophobins (HFBI and HFBII) produced by Trichoderma reesei. The results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins with P6 symmetry computationally and P3 symmetry experimentally, with a unit cell size of 56 Å. The study also discusses the possibility of an alternate ordering with a three protein unit cell and P3 symmetry, which could play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films, indicating a mechanism of significance in both biology and nanotechnology. Hydrophobins have various industrial applications due to their unique interfacial film properties, including foams, protein immobilization, emulsification, and dispersion of insoluble compounds. The exceptional properties of hydrophobin films can be found on various interfaces, including liquid-liquid and gas-liquid interfaces. This summary focuses on the structure, mechanisms, and applications of HFBI and HFBII, two class II hydrophobins from Trichoderma reesei, which have potential industrial applications due to their ability to form amphiphilic 2D crystalline structures at the air-water interface.
This summary discusses a study on Leishmania donovani, the primary cause of visceral leishmaniasis. The study focuses on threonyl tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) of L. donovani, an enzyme required for protein synthesis in bacteria and fungi. Recombinant LdThrRS was expressed in E. coli and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. The subcellular localization of LdThrRS was found to be in both the cytosol and mitochondria of the cell. Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS were generated in Leishmania promastigotes, and their proliferation, virulence, aminoacylation activity, and sensitivity to the ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin, were studied. A 3D-model of LdThrRS was compared to that of humans and found to be similar. Borrelidin showed a strong affinity for LdThrRS (KD: 0.04 μM) and effectively inhibited the aminoacylation activity of rLdThrRS (IC50: 0.06 μM). Borrelidin inhibited the promastigotes stage of the parasites (IC50: 21 μM). The study suggests that LdThrRS is essential for L. donovani survival and is a potential target for drug discovery efforts.
In the field of virology, understanding how the innate immune response of mammalian cells responds to viral infections is crucial in developing therapeutic strategies. A study on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has identified a multi-motif PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern) signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I, a crucial protein involved in the innate immune response to RNA virus infection. The HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection. The study also highlights the importance of accurate discrimination of self from non-self by PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) and the role of multiple motifs in a PAMP that marks it as non-self to avoid self-recognition and subsequent autoimmunity. The research provides insights into the antiviral therapeutic potential of targeted RIG-I signaling activation, which could lead to innovative vaccine vectors and antiviral therapeutic strategies for controlling RNA virus infections. Overall, this study significantly contributes to the field of virology and innate immunity, offering a more profound understanding of the complex processes involved in the innate immune response.
The functions of eosinophils extend beyond host defense and allergy to metabolism and tissue regeneration, and have been found to promote growth of parasitic worms. A study investigating the mechanism of this observation focused on Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle, finding that eosinophils promote larval growth by an IL-4 dependent mechanism that limits local interferon-driven responses that otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle. This interaction allows for a nutrient-rich environment that facilitates larval growth. Parasitism in nematodes emerged in free-living nematodes as a result of multiple, independent evolutionary events and is associated with loss of functions that enable a free-living lifestyle. Understanding these dependencies is important for devising therapeutic and prophylactic approaches to controlling parasitic disease. Eosinophils, a hallmark of the host immune response to parasitic worms, have been shown to have varying influences on worms, from no effect to protecting the host to supporting the parasite. Eosinophils have also been found to have a regulatory influence on the outcome of worm infection through control of energy metabolism. The current study builds on previous findings of eosinophils positively regulating both survival and growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae, with larval survival dependent on eosinophil-derived interleukin (IL)-10 and growth supported by a distinct mechanism independent of IL-10. The study found a requirement for IL-4/signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 ( STAT6 ) signaling in eosinophils for normal larval growth. In the absence of eosinophils, there is a sustained, local, interferon-driven inflammation that promotes a shift in metabolism in infected muscle, altering nutrient availability for the larvae. The findings provide evidence for a host-parasite relationship in which the recruitment of eosinophils promotes a nutrient-rich environment that facilitates larval growth.
Genome-wide replication timing studies had suggested that mammalian chromosomes consist of megabase-scale domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless transition regions. However, a quantitative genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in several human cell types contradicts this view. Replication origins are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire as small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase, with a mean replication fork velocity of 0.7 kb/min and a maximum of 2 kb/min. There are no large regions of unidirectional fork progression, and temporal transition regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at a rate that increases during S phase. Activation of internal origins in a specific temporal transition region is directly demonstrated by DNA combing of the IGH locus in HeLa cells. These findings challenge the deterministic replication timing program model and support a stochastic model for chromosomal replication, where origins fire independently of each other but under the control of long-range chromatin structure. These findings provide a general model for the replication kinetics of mammalian genomes.
The ability to recognize objects regardless of changes in position, lighting, or perspective is crucial for everyday tasks, and the brain performs this task with remarkable ease. However, even small changes in the position of an object can lead to vastly different stimuli on the level of primary sensory signals. Therefore, the brain must identify different stimuli as representations of the same underlying cause, which requires the development of an internal representation that is invariant to irrelevant changes of the stimulus. This is known as the slowness or temporal stability principle. The brain gathers information from the sensory input experienced during interaction with the environment to form invariant representations in a largely unsupervised manner. Slowness learning can be implemented through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window and is not just relevant for the learning window alone, but rather the convolution of the learning window with the postsynaptic potential. Slow feature analysis (SFA) and the trace rule can be derived from slowness learning, both of which are compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. SFA consists of finding the input-output function that generates the most slowly varying output signal, which is required to be an instantaneous function of the input signal. SFA has been used to learn translation, rotation, and other invariances in a model of the visual system and has been shown to reproduce a wide range of features of complex cells in primary visual cortex. However, as a technical algorithm, SFA is biologically implausible, and the eigenvector that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the time derivative of a multidimensional signal must be extracted, which seems odd compared to what neurons are normally thought to do. Therefore, the goal is to show how this kind of computation can be realized in a spiking model neuron.
The development of drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a significant challenge in cancer therapy, and it is attributed to intrinsic and acquired resistance. Intrinsic resistance is primarily caused by genetic mutations, while acquired resistance can emerge during treatment due to phenotypic plasticity and drug-induced cell state transitions. A recent study shows that cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT) is a previously unrecognized behavior in heterogeneous tumors where cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cancer cells when exposed to cancer therapy. The study used a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit to engineer phenotypically diverse NSCLC cells and monitored their three-dimensional growth dynamics under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. The results showed that the combination of wild-type and mutants in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug-sensitive cells despite drug pressure via induction of cell state transitions. Furthermore, an ex vivo human tumor model predicted that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates to prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. Therefore, profiling for druggable targets alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy.
The EMINI population cohort, consisting of 17,872 participants in Mbeya Region, Tanzania, was used to conduct a seroprevalence study on Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae. A total of 1,228 participants above the age of 5 years were randomly selected and stratified by age, altitude of residence, and ownership of domestic mammals. The study found that the seroprevalence of SFG-seropositivity in the cohort was 67.9% (range among nine sites: 42.8--91.4%). Multivariable analysis revealed an association with age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density. At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence. SFG rickettsial infection seems to be common in the more rural population of Mbeya Region, with the spread being further limited by temperature and higher elevation. Examination of the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses seems warranted in a prospective study to estimate the disease burden in the population and determine the causative pathogens. The EMINI study was a population-based survey with longitudinal follow up, which was used to provide a representative sample of the population in the nine study sites. Blood samples were cryopreserved after cells were separated from serum, and serum samples were tested for antibodies against SFG-Rickettsia by indirect immunofluorescence. Uni- and multi-variable Poisson regression models with robust (or Huber-White) variance estimates adjusted for household clustering were used to identify possible risk factors for SFG IgG positivity.
The study reveals the role of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers conducted an RNAi screen for regulators of innate immune defense genes and identified the two stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturases that synthesize oleate in C. elegans. They found that the synthesis of oleate is necessary for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune defense genes. C. elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous oleate. However, oleate is not sufficient to drive protective immune activation. These findings suggest an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection. The study highlights the health-promoting effects of monounsaturated fatty acids and their role in regulating immune responses.
Riboswitches are regulatory elements that modulate gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding, with recent studies indicating that riboswitch agonists may have antimicrobial properties by binding to the riboswitch domain. Guanine riboswitches regulate the transport and biosynthesis of purine metabolites, which are critical for the nucleotides cellular pool. Upon guanine binding, these riboswitches stabilize a 5′-untranslated mRNA structure that causes transcription attenuation of the downstream open reading frame. A pyrimidine compound (PC1) was identified that binds guanine riboswitches, exhibiting bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species including nosocomial pathogens. This selective bacterial killing is only achieved when guaA, a gene coding for a GMP synthetase, is under the control of the riboswitch. Antibiotics binding to riboswitches provide novel antimicrobial compounds that can be rationally designed from riboswitch crystal structures. PC1 targets a different metabolic pathway, inhibiting multiple drug-resistant strains, making it a promising antimicrobial agent. This finding is significant as community-acquired bacterial infections have recently started to emerge, with multiple drug resistance being a growing problem due to the excessive use of antibiotics and limited chemical scaffolds for drug design.
A study on how gaze informs the construction of mental space during wayfinding in visual species like primates was conducted by examining the navigation behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity of macaque monkeys as they searched a virtual reality maze for a reward. The findings indicate that counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, thereby supporting self-awareness in the construction of space. Place cells, which are the quintessential signature of hippocampal neural activity in rodents and code the animal’s position in an environment, were found to be sensitive to one or more variables like head direction, point of gaze, or task context in primates. Hippocampal activity was best fit by a fine-grained state space comprising current position, view, and action contexts. These results suggest that the nature of hippocampal coding in primates, including humans, is multidimensional and task-situated, and bridges the gap between studies in rodents and primates in real and virtual environments.
The isthmic organizer (IsO) plays a crucial role in the development of vertebrates by controlling the development of the mid- and hindbrain. The IsO is characterized by a well-defined pattern of gene expression around the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB) maintained by a regulatory network of transcription and secreted factors. This study uses a Boolean analysis of the characteristic spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB to predict key regulatory interactions in this network. The analysis reveals that Fgf8 has a maintaining, rather than inducing, effect on Wnt1 expression. This prediction is confirmed by mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures. The findings allow for the construction of a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB, which can explain the stable maintenance of the MHB and time-courses of expression patterns under wild-type and various knock-out conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks and understand the maintenance of the MHB on a systems level.
The apicomplexan parasite Theileria annulata transforms infected host cells, inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion. After sporozoite entry, the parasite develops into the transforming schizont, which remains tethered to host cell microtubules (MTs) and engages the cell's astral and central spindle MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis to ensure its distribution between the two daughter cells. The molecular mechanism by which the schizont recruits and stabilizes host cell MTs is unknown, but a new study has identified a key player in this process. The Theileria parasite surface protein p104, previously identified as a Theileria sporozoite microneme-rhoptry protein, functions as a bona fide EB1-binding protein, interacting with EB1 via a classic ‘SxIP’ motif. This is the first parasite-encoded EB1-binding protein described to date. EB1 is an important regulator of MT dynamics and a central component of the MT plus end protein interaction network. The study found that p104 recruits EB1 in vitro through a consensus SxIP motif located in a highly disordered C-terminal region, and that this interaction is cell cycle regulated. This discovery provides important new insight into the mode of interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton, and highlights the potential of p104 as a target for the development of new anti-parasitic therapies.
In budding yeast, broken replication forks caused by replication passing through nicks, ligase insufficiency, or other DNA damage can result in persistent DNA damage and constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. This DNA damage can be repaired via homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR). In cases of mild insufficiency in the replicative ligase Cdc9, a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, activated DNA damage checkpoints, and longer telomeres arise. These longer telomeres are dependent on functional telomerase, the core DNA damage signaling cascade Mec1-Rad9-Rad5
Onchocerciasis, caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, is a major public health concern. Current diagnostic methods for onchocerciasis rely on detecting microfilariae in skin snips or using antibody-based tests, but these methods have limitations such as being invasive, lacking specificity, or not detecting pre-patent infections. A study was conducted to investigate the potential of using luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) as a more rapid, specific, and standardized diagnostic assay for Onchocerca volvulus infection. The study tested four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens (Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1 and Ov-CPI-1) on a large cohort of blinded sera from uninfected controls and patients with a proven parasitic infection including Onchocerca volvulus (Ov), Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb), Loa loa (Ll), Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss), and other conditions. The results showed that antibody responses to the four different Ov antigens allowed for unequivocal differentiation between Ov-infected and uninfected control sera with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The study also found that a mixture of the 4 Ov antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format, called QLIPS, showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing the Ov-infected sera from the uninfected control sera and had the best performance in distinguishing Ov from Wb, Ll, and Ss-infected sera with sensitivity and specificity values of 76%, 84% and 93% respectively. The multi-antigen LIPS assay can be used as a rapid, high throughput, and specific tool to not only to diagnose individual Ov infections but also as a sensitive and potentially point-of-care method for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Ov infection. This new diagnostic tool could be very useful for controlling and eliminating onchocerciasis.
A study was conducted in two rural districts of Yen Bai province in northern Vietnam to evaluate the impact of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming on hematological and parasitological outcomes in women of reproductive age. The study, which included 389 women, found that after 54 months, mean hemoglobin increased from 122 g/L to 131 g/L, and anemia prevalence decreased from 38% to 18%. Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia were reduced to 8% and 4%, respectively. The prevalence of hookworm infection decreased from 76% to 11%, and moderate or heavy intensity infection with any soil transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%. However, results differed significantly between ethnic groups, with Kinh women having a lower prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency anemia at baseline compared to non-Kinh women. Despite an overall drop in compliance with taking iron-folic acid supplements at 54 months, the identified difference in non-compliance between Kinh and non-Kinh groups was not significant. Overall, the study found that population-based interventions can efficiently and effectively reduce anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and soil transmitted helminth infections in women of reproductive age, maintaining them below the level of public health concern. However, maintaining iron stores over extended periods through regular iron-folic acid supplementation is essential in areas with inadequate dietary intake of heme iron.
Cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in controlling viral infections, particularly against herpesviruses that can establish lifelong persistence despite primed immunity. Herpesviruses exploit immune evasion strategies, including reduced viral antigen expression during latency and targeting antigen presentation pathways. A prototypical herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), encodes a novel immunoevasin, gp150, which inhibits antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d molecules. Gp150's mechanism of T-cell escape does not involve degradation of antigen-presenting molecules and depends on its abundant glycosylation, creating a shield that impedes surface presentation of antigen. This is an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses. EBV gp150 prolongs the timespan for producing viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral life cycle. Cell-mediated immunity, mediated by antigen-specific T cells, is essential for eliminating virus-infected cells, reducing viral replication, and stimulating other immune effector functions. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are activated by peptide Ags presented at the cell surface in the context of HLA class I and class II molecules, while invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells recognize lipid Ags presented by CD1d, a non-classical, non-polymorphic HLA molecule. In EBV infections, iNKT cells play a role in providing protection against viral infection. EBV downregulates its Ag expression in the latent stage of infection and exploits immune evasion gene products, particularly during its replicative phase, to interfere with immune activation. EBV gp150 interferes with immune recognition of HLA I, II, and CD1d/Ag complexes at the cell surface in a glycan-dependent manner, representing a novel immune evasion mechanism in herpesviruses.
Chlamydia trachomatis, the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide and the most frequent sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the United States, is an obligate intracellular gram-negative bacterium with a developmental cycle involving extracellular infectious forms called elementary bodies (EB) and intracellular replicative reticulate bodies (RB) within a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole called an inclusion. The exact mechanisms of chlamydial attachment and entry into nonphagocytic cells are unclear, but the involvement of actin in the process is conserved across chlamydial species. The translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) is conserved among pathogenic chlamydial species and has been identified as playing an essential role in chlamydial pathogenesis. Tarp harbors at least three functionally distinct domains: an N-terminal tyrosine-rich repeat domain, a proline-rich domain required for Tarp oligomerization, and an actin binding domain. The proline rich domain and actin binding domain are harbored within the minimum Tarp peptide required for Tarp mediated actin nucleation. Tarp orthologs from Chlamydia pneumonia, C. caviae, C. muridarum and various C. trachomatis serovars all harbor at least one and up to four functional actin binding domains and promote actin nucleation as determined by in vitro polymerization assays. These findings indicate that Tarp mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and this function plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells.
Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic disease endemic in the People's Republic of China, the Philippines, and Indonesia, with over 40 mammalian species acting as reservoirs, including water buffaloes that contribute up to 75% to human transmission in China. A new copro-parasitological method, the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA-SD) technique, was developed to improve the visualization and quantification of S. japonicum eggs in bovine feces. This technique, which involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy, removes bulk debris and renders it translucent, allowing for improved microscopic visualization and accurate quantification of S. japonicum eggs in bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts. The FEA-SD technique could be a valuable surveillance tool for animal reservoirs of S. japonicum, particularly in areas with low to high infection intensity or where there is suspected elimination of schistosomiasis japonica. The FEA-SD technique is as efficient as real-time PCR for determining schistosome prevalence in bovines but is less costly to implement. This new method can help improve the control and surveillance of schistosomiasis japonica by providing an accurate and cost-effective tool for identifying and quantifying S. japonicum eggs in bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) in recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) by generating knock-in mice with a point mutation in the catalytic site of P3h1 (Lepre1H662A). This substitution abolished P3h1 activity but retained the ability to form a complex with Crtap and thus the collagen chaperone function. The knock-in mice showed absence of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the α1 (I) and α1 (II) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They had normal appearance, no growth defects, and normal cartilage growth plate histology, but showed decreased trabecular bone mass. This new mouse model recapitulated elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth phenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. The findings suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex.In addition, the study also summarized previous findings about the role of mutations in genes encoding cartilage associated protein (CRTAP), P3H1, and cyclophilin B (CYPB) in recessive OI. Mutations in these genes can cause recessive forms of OI by altering post-translational collagen modification, trafficking, and signaling. Null mutations in either LEPRE1 or CRTAP can result in recessive forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) with almost identical features, suggesting that P3H1 and CRTAP stabilize each other.Overall, this study provides insights into the function of P3H1 in OI and the potential consequences of selective inactivation of its hydroxylase activity, which could have implications for the development of targeted therapies for this genetic disorder.
The P-element, a DNA transposon, was horizontally transferred from a distant relative into Drosophila melanogaster, causing 'hybrid dysgenesis' and spreading globally. Recently, it has also been found in D. simulans, having been horizontally acquired from D. melanogaster. This invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements becoming common by 2014. Transposable elements (TEs) like the P-element are genetically simple and can be beneficial but are often deleterious, causing DNA damage and mutations. Hybrid dysgenesis, exhibited by D. melanogaster crosses between 'P strains' and 'M strains', is caused by DNA damage from actively transposing P-elements in the germline. This damage is reduced in offspring protected by piRNAs sequestered in the egg cytoplasm, which target the P-element mRNA for degradation. TEs, like the P-element, can be vertically transmitted and horizontally transmitted between species, causing limited damage in the short-term and substantial damage in the long-term.
A recent study has explored the use of rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, for marking male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the context of sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT) control strategies. Rhodamine B can be administered to male mosquitoes via sugar-feeding, allowing for the dye to be transferred to females during mating and resulting in body marking. The study found that solutions containing 0.4% and 0.8% rhodamine B were the most effective at marking male body and seminal fluid, and that marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness. The use of rhodamine B marking is also less expensive and time-consuming compared to other methods such as PCR and protein/isotope labelling. This technique has the potential to be a useful evaluation method for male-based SIT/IIT control strategies and as a mark-release-recapture method for male mosquitoes.
Bacterial superantigens are toxic molecules produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes that can cause toxic shock by activating an intense immune response. Superantigens bind directly to MHC-II and TCR molecules, activating up to 20% of T cells and inducing Th1 cytokines such as IL-2, INF-γ, and TNF. Superantigens also require CD28 costimulation to induce cytokine gene expression. A study found that superantigens must bind directly into the dimer interface of CD28 to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity. Mice were protected from lethal superantigen challenge by short peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer interface and by peptides selected to compete with the superantigen for its binding site in CD28. Structural analysis showed that when a superantigen binds to the T cell receptor on the T cell and major histocompatibility class II molecule on the antigen-presenting cell, CD28 can be accommodated readily as a third superantigen receptor in the quaternary complex, with the CD28 dimer interface oriented towards the β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain in the superantigen. The study identifies the CD28 homodimer interface as a critical receptor target for superantigens and broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms.
The use of pluripotent stem cells in the clinic requires an understanding of the mechanisms regulating their cell cycle, proliferation, and potency. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase due to the lack of expression of cell cycle inhibitors, which determines naïve pluripotency and holds back differentiation. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls mESC pluripotency via the Wnt-effector Tcf3, but its role in controlling the cell cycle of mESCs is unclear. This pathway, known to be mitogenic in somatic tissues, triggers an anti-proliferative effect in mESCs via Tcf1 activity. Tcf1 is recruited to the promoters of cell cycle genes such as the Ink4/Arf locus, leading to an increase in negative cell cycle regulators such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, and p19Arf upon Wnt pathway activation. These findings show that, in contrast to its mitogenic effect in somatic cells, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has an anti-proliferative effect in mESCs via Tcf1 activity. This is important because mESCs are believed to be refractory to the action of some CDKi as p16Ink4a, but an increased expression of p21 or p27 can increase the length of mESC G1 and reduce their proliferation. The Ink4/Arf locus, which encodes for p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a and p19Arf, controls the two main cell cycle inhibitors and tumor suppressor pathways, and its expression is upregulated after Wnt pathway activation in mESCs. These findings highlight the potential of Wnt/Tcf1 in regulating mESC proliferation and have implications for the use of mESCs in regenerative medicine.
Dengue fever (DF) is a viral infection caused by the dengue virus (DENV) and can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal outcomes. The severity of DF has been associated with high viral load and exacerbated cytokine production. DENV can infect and replicate in human monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, which can release soluble mediators that contribute to vascular permeability and plasma leakage. Dendritic cells can be divided into two major subpopulations: myeloid or conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Unlike cDCs, pDCs are not found in homeostatic tissues and are mainly found in circulating blood and in lymphoid tissues. pDCs can produce large amounts of type I interferon (IFN-α) in response to virus exposure.In this study, the authors aimed to characterize pDC activation in dengue patients and their function under DENV-2 stimulation in vitro. They found that pDCs of mild dengue patients exhibit significantly higher frequencies of mTRAIL (membrane TRAIL) compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IFN-α and soluble TRAIL were also increased in mild compared to severe dengue patients, positively correlating with pDC activation. In vitro exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDC, which was relocalized from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-2-induced mTRAIL relocalization and IFN-α production by pDC, suggesting the involvement of endocytosis pathway in DENV-2 infection. Coculture of pDC/DENV-2-infected monocytes revealed a dramatic decrease of antigen detection, indicating that pDC effect on viral load reduction was mainly dependent on IFN-α production. These data suggest that pDC activation and TRAIL-expressing pDCs may have an important role in the outcome of dengue disease.
The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is complex and involves the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in host defense during both active and latent phases of infection. Experimental evidence has shown that TNF-neutralizing drugs increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB), and animal studies support this finding. A computational approach was taken to characterize the role of TNF in protection against the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection. The study found that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for causing reactivation of latent infection and that sTNF is essential for control of infection. The study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the requirement for reduction of inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. The importance of TNF in control of TB is highlighted by an increased susceptibility of patients to TB reactivation. The incidence of TB in individuals receiving antibody appears to be higher than in those treated with receptor fusion molecule, suggesting that there are differences in the mode of action of these agents. Simulations predict that with an inoculum of 25 mycobacteria, latency is achieved in fewer than 300 days under appropriate immunologic conditions. Latent TB is characterized by low levels of extracellular bacterial load and all intracellular bacteria reside within a small number of chronically infected macrophages. During latency, TNF levels are on the order of 0.12 pg/mL, and neutralizing this concentration of TNF drives the system into active TB, indicating a critical role for even small amounts of TNF in maintaining latency. Predicted ranges for IFN-γ and IL-10 correlate with studies measuring cytokine levels at the infection site. Total macrophage numbers do not change significantly in the first year post-infection, and most of them become infected by one year post-infection. The roles played by different cellular sources of TNF involved in protective immunity remain unclear. The mathematical model can simulate active infection, which is characterized by uncontrolled growth of intracellular and extracellular bacteria throughout the simulation, reaching a total bacterial load of 108 per cm3 of granulomatous tissue approximately at day 300. High bacterial load is coupled to very high levels of IFN-γ and TNF. Total macrophage population increases within the first 200 days, and by one year post-infection most of them are infected. T cell numbers are comparable with macrophage numbers during active TB. Among all TNF-related mechanisms, lymphocyte recruitment and macrophage activation are the most influential toward controlling bacterial levels when compared with TNF-induced apoptosis. The model predicts that enhanced recruitment of lymphocytes is a desirable strategy toward establishing latency. Little or no data are available to indicate the fraction of TNF that is cleaved into sTNF in vivo. We introduce a parameter σ to indicate the fraction of TNF cleaved. The remaining (1−σ)Fα represents tmTNF. Considering the relative transient expression of tmTNF in vitro, we assume that σ is approximately 95% so that the majority of tmTNF is cleaved and released in its bioactive soluble form. We test variations on levels of σ (percent sTNF) and report results in two settings. The system gradually shifts to higher bacterial loads with decreasing amounts of sTNF, and reactivation occurs when almost no sTNF is released. This suggests sTNF is necessary to control active TB and to maintain latency, likely because of its crucial role in lymphocyte and macrophage recruitment, and that tmTNF is not sufficient to maintain latency in humans. We investigate the importance of specific TNF-dependent mechanisms that allow for infection control via sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. We observe how variations in different sets of parameters affect bacterial load. The model predicts that enhanced recruitment of lymphocytes is a desirable strategy toward establishing latency. Macrophage activation plays a more important role in maintaining latency: the correlation between macrophage activation rate and bacterial load is significant only after latency is achieved. TmTNF effects on macrophage and lymphocyte activation are not significant in either achieving or maintaining latency. Among all TNF-related mechanisms, the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses indicate that lymphocyte recruitment and macrophage activation are the most influential toward controlling bacterial levels when compared with TNF-induced apoptosis. This is consistent with experimental evidence that TNF-induced apoptosis accounts for only 5%-10% killing of MIs. Our virtual deletion and depletion experiments are consistent with TNF gene knockouts and TNF neutralization studies, further supporting that TNF is necessary toward both achieving and maintaining latency.
Gene retroposition, which involves the creation of intronless copies of existing genes through reverse transcription of mRNAs and subsequent insertion into the genome, leads to significant genetic variation between individuals. Recent studies have revealed the presence of at least 208 retroduplication variations (RDVs) in individual genomes, mainly resulting from recent retroduplications. In this study, the researchers used data from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project, RNA-Seq data from the Illumina BodyMap project, and data from lymphoblastoid cell lines provided by the Geuvadis Consortium to investigate variation in the loss of ancestral retrocopies among different human populations and examine retrocopy expression levels. The researchers also developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome and experimentally confirmed their presence or absence in the genomes of 17 different populations.The study identified 193 RDVs, the majority of which resulted from retrocopy deletion. Most of these RDVs had not been previously reported. The expression, conservation, and low rate of deletion of ten retrocopies suggest some functionality. The researchers also found nine retrogenes that undergo statistically significant differential expression between populations.Retrogenes can be functional and play a role in various biological processes and diseases. For instance, the RHOB gene, a tumor suppressor that belongs to the Rho GTPases family, is a retrocopy involved in cancer development. Additionally, retroposition gives rise to considerable genetic variation between individuals and provides valuable insights into evolutionary processes and population history.Despite the advances in sequencing technology and the increasing number of studies on retrocopies, many questions remains unanswered. Current methods of discovering novel retropositions are limited and do not account for evolutionary events that occurred earlier in the human lineage. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms located in retrogene promoters and regulatory sequences might result in different levels of retrogene expression between individuals and populations, but this has not been thoroughly explored.Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the importance of retroposition in shaping genetic variation, evolutionary processes, and disease development. Further research is needed to understand the functional aspects of different kinds of retrogene polymorphisms and their potential implications for human health and disease.
Neurocysticercosis (NCC), an infection of the central nervous system by the larval stage of the parasitic helminth Taenia solium, is a common disease in regions where pigs are raised freely. NCC is a major cause of epileptic seizures in developing countries and can affect the brain parenchyma, cerebellum, brainstem, ventricles, subarachnoid space, and spine. The two main forms of NCC are parenchymal and extraparenchymal disease, with different clinical presentations, pathophysiology, and treatment. A study was conducted to quantify and compare the inflammatory response following cysticidal treatment to cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma, meninges, or both tissues in a naturally infected pig model. The results showed that parenchymal cysticerci provoked a significantly greater level of pericystic inflammation after antiparasitic treatment compared to meningeal and corticomeningeal cysticerci. The suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs in meningeal cysticerci may be the reason subarachnoid NCC is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal NCC. The vessels in parenchymal and meningeal tissue differ in their constitutive proteins, susceptibility to changes in permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), expression of cytokines that regulate BBB function, and associated astrocytes. These tissue-specific characteristics could explain the differences in inflammation around the cysticercus in experimental murine models and thus be involved in the severity of the inflammatory reaction elicited when the parasite degenerates.
Yaws, a re-emerging endemic treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp . pertenue, is reportedly endemic in Ghana, with azithromycin mass distribution being the cornerstone of the WHO yaws eradication campaign. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in thirty communities in two districts of Ghana where MDA for trachoma had previously been conducted to investigate the possibility of drug-resistant T. pallidum ssp . pertenue or alternative causes of some of the reported cases. Children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled, and samples for treponemal serology and lesion PCR were collected. Of the 90 children enrolled, syphilis serology was negative in all, and PCR for T. pallidum ssp pertenue was negative in all children. However, Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. The study found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities, and H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic testing into both pre and post-MDA surveillance systems is required to better inform yaws control programs. The findings emphasize the urgent need for accurate data on the epidemiology of yaws to guide disease eradication efforts and the importance of serological testing in surveillance to better inform national reporting data and yaws control programs.
The Jak-STAT pathway plays a crucial role in the persistence of HIV infection, as it regulates T cell homeostasis, particularly in memory T cells where the virus resides. Cytokines involved in memory T cell homeostasis trigger the Jak-STAT pathway, leading to increased levels of integrated viral DNA. Two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, have been found to block seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir in vitro. These inhibitors reduce the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA, block viral production from infected cells, and inhibit IL-15-induced viral reactivation from latent stores. This prevents transmission of infectious particles to bystander activated T cells. In vivo, Jak inhibitors impact the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in all memory CD4 T cell subsets. The Jak-STAT pathway is also triggered by type I and II Interferons, which enhance HIV replication. Inhibition of Jak-STAT signaling by ruxolitinib has been shown to significantly impede T cell homeostasis, reduce CD4 T cell numbers, and decrease numbers of T regulatory cells and activated (HLA-DR+) CD4 T cell populations after a few weeks of treatment. Tofacitinib, on the other hand, showed only small changes in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ counts and an increase in B cell counts after 24 weeks of treatment. Overall, Jak inhibitors represent a therapeutic modality to prevent key events of T cell activation that regulate HIV persistence and could be integrated into future curative strategies.
Baculoviruses are large DNA viruses that infect arthropods, particularly insects from the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. They have a long history of use as microbial insecticides to control insect pest populations in forestry and agriculture. Baculovirus infection impacts a host in various ways, affecting different tissues and cell types differently. Insects have innate immune responses to virus infections, including cellular and humoral responses that share the same signalling pathways. These responses involve hemocyte-mediated activities like phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation, as well as the identification of invading microbes by pattern recognition proteins and the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The production of AMPs in insects is regulated by the Toll, Imd, and JAK-STAT signalling pathways.Recent research has shown that the insect immune protein hemolin is involved in baculovirus infection. In the Lepidopteran host Antheraea pernyi, baculovirus infection induces the expression of hemolin, and silencing of hemolin affects the progress of viral infection. However, this may not be the case for all insects, as another study found no changes in the expression of hemolin after infection with baculovirus in two species of Lepidoptera.Immune-related genes are regulated after baculovirus infection, indicating their involvement in the response to baculovirus. After being ingested by the insect, baculoviruses reach the gut, one of the main physical barriers for the establishment of a systemic infection in the larvae. Immune aspects in insects were initially studied in the hemolymph and fat body, but recent research has also focused on the gut. Gut epithelial tissue has been found to express pattern recognition proteins as well as antimicrobial proteins, indicating that the gut plays an important role in the immune responses of insects. The immune system faces an enormous challenge in gut tissue, as it must continuously confront microbiota present in the gut lumen.Gut microbiota are involved in various physiological functions, including digesting food and protecting against pathogen infections by occupying attachment sites, competing for nutrients, and preventing colonization. Commensal microbiota present in the gut modulate insect immune responses and insect susceptibility to pathogens such as Bacillus thuringeiensis. In vertebrates, gut commensal microbiota play a crucial role in the immune responses to pathogens and shape the gut immune system. The knowledge of genes affected by virus infection may serve to improve baculoviruses as heterologous protein expression vectors and as biocontrol agents.
A team of researchers have isolated and characterized a novel gene, OSD1, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that controls entry into the second meiotic division. By combining a mutation in this gene with two other mutations that affect key meiotic processes, the team created a genotype called MiMe, in which meiosis is replaced by mitosis. This allows the plants to produce functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to their mother. This research is an important step towards understanding and engineering apomixis, asexual reproduction through seeds, which has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by allowing any desired genotype to be perpetuated through successive seed generations. The OSD1 gene is conserved throughout the plant kingdom and its paralogue, UVI4, is necessary for maintaining the mitotic state. The team hypothesizes that OSD1 may fine tune APC activity/cyclin levels at the end of meiosis I to ensure the transition to meiosis II. Further research is needed to introduce apomixis, which consists of apomeiosis, parthenogenesis, and the initiation of endosperm development, into a sexual plant species. However, the strong conservation of the genes involved in the MiMe genotype among plants suggests that apomixis may be engineered in any plant species, including crops.
The prioritization of candidate disease-causing genes is crucial in the post-genomic era and is typically based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, current methods use a static picture of human PPIs, which may not accurately represent the specific tissues impacted by diseases. To address this, a study has constructed tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 tissues by integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with PPI information. The results show that tissue-specific PPI networks significantly improve the prioritization of results compared to those obtained using a generic PPI network. This approach also allows for the prediction of novel disease-tissue associations, which can point to sub-clinical tissue effects that may escape early detection. The study of tissue-specific PPI networks is still relatively unexplored, but has the potential to enhance the accuracy of existing network-based gene prioritization algorithms and provide insight into the molecular basis of hereditary diseases.
The article discusses a flexible two-locus model for the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit human diseases such as malaria. The model allows for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide, and allows selection pressures and dominance values to differ depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. The authors demonstrate the model's application by investigating the use of insecticides either sequentially or mixed together to minimize the spread of resistance. The model recovers previously published results and conducts a sensitivity analysis over an extensive parameter space to identify the circumstances that favor mixtures over sequences. The results show that both strategies lasted more than 500 mosquito generations, but in those runs where resistance had spread to high levels by 500 generations, 56% favored sequential use and 44% favored mixtures. The authors emphasize that the paper is about designing and implementing a flexible modelling strategy to investigate the spread of insecticide resistance in vector populations and demonstrate how the model can identify vector control strategies most likely to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance. Insect populations are controlled for various reasons such as pests, nuisance-biting mosquitoes, and to control the spread of vector-borne infectious diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that 17% of all infectious diseases are vector-borne. This manuscript focuses on the control of mosquitoes responsible for transmitting human malaria, which is the target of considerable public health efforts through the deployment of insecticide-treated bed nets and insecticides sprayed onto house walls. However, these efforts have resulted in the evolution of insecticide resistance (IR) in mosquito populations. The article discusses four main strategies that may potentially be used as insecticide deployment strategies, including sequential use, mixtures, rotations, and mosaics. The authors highlight the need for a planned and rational way to deploy new insecticide products in a planned and rational way to minimize selection for resistance while maintaining their impact in disease control.
The sialome of Rhodnius neglectus, a triatomine insect that acts as a vector for Chagas disease, was studied using next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry. A total of 4,230 coding DNA sequences (CDS) were deposited in GenBank, with 73 of them confirmed by proteomic analysis. The sialome of R. neglectus was found to contain serine protease transcripts and families of proteins that are common in hematophagous arthropods, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5. Metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding protein families were less abundant. The data provides new insights into the complex interplay between hematophagous vectors and their vertebrate hosts and aids in understanding the dynamics of the blood-feeding process and disease transmission. The RNA-seq sequencing generated over 12 million reads, which were mapped to contigs and annotated using various databases. Coding sequences were classified into putative secreted, housekeeping, unknown, transposable element, and viral product classes. The housekeeping class was the largest, followed by the secreted class which included subclasses with previously known gene families present in hematophagous saliva, such as lipocalin, nitrophorin, antigen-5, as well as gene families not commonly reported in triatomine saliva, such as serine protease and disintegrin. Lipocalins were one of the most abundant groups of transcripts, with 16.29% of putatively secreted reads. These proteins are usually found in blood-sucking insect and tick saliva and are associated with binding to small hydrophobic molecules, cell surface receptors, or other proteins.
The post-genomic era has seen a significant increase in high-throughput technologies, with transcriptional profiling by microarrays being one of the most widely used. This technology has been applied to identify genes differentially expressed in response to different environmental conditions, with the assumption that such genes are functionally important under those conditions. However, it remains unclear whether differential expression is predictive of functional importance. To address this question, this study employed Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for the interaction of native soil nematode taxa and soil bacteria. Researchers used transcriptional profiling to identify candidate genes regulated in response to different bacteria isolated in association with grassland nematodes or from grassland soils. They then used mutations to inactivate 21 of the identified genes and demonstrated that most of these genes contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment. These findings suggest that changes in food source, such as those that occur in environmental disturbances, can have a large effect on gene expression and have important consequences for fitness. The study also used regression analysis to show that for many genes, the degree of differential gene expression between two bacterial environments predicted the magnitude of the effect of the loss of gene function on life history traits in those environments. Overall, this study highlights the potential of using transcriptional profiling and genetic analysis to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying organismal responses to environmental changes.
A critical event in mammalian embryo development is the formation of an inner cell mass (ICM) surrounded by a trophoectoderm (TE), which is a shell of cells that later form extra-embryonic structures. A study using multi-scale, stochastic modeling investigated the design principles responsible for the robust establishment of these structures. The investigation made three key predictions, all supported by quantitative imaging. First, stochasticity in the expression of critical genes promotes cell plasticity and has a crucial role in accurately organizing the developing mouse blastocyst. Second, asymmetry in the levels of noise variation (expression fluctuation) of Cdx2 and Oct4 provides a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while ameliorating the potentially detrimental effects of stochasticity. Third, by controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, the embryo temporally modulates plasticity and creates a time window during which each cell can continually read its environment and adjust its fate. These results suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst. This is crucial for the development of mammals, where a single cell gives rise to an organism of exquisite complexity. The fertilized egg begins this process by dividing multiple times to form a morula, which then undergoes compaction to create the blastocyst. Each cell of the early cleavage stage embryo is considered to be totipotent and can differentiate to become either the ICM, which mainly gives rise to the future embryo, or the TE, which forms extra-embryonic structures. This lineage divergence is the first differentiation event in mammalian development and is an intensely studied process in mammalian reproductive biology. ICM and TE cell populations are distinguished by both their spatial position within an embryo and gene expression differences. Structurally, the ICM is located in the interior of the blastocyst and the TE forms an outer layer surrounding it. Molecularly, Pou5f1/Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 transcription factors (TFs) specify ICM cells, while Tead4 and Cdx2 TFs specify the TE. Interplay among these TFs is critical in specifying the ICM and TE cell fates. A preimplantation mouse embryo interprets various types of information and coordinates the cellular response to produce a normal blastocyst. Although lineage biasing of blastomeres might start as early as the 4-cell stage, the embryo is a dynamic entity and each cell at this stage maintains the ability to give rise to both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. Removal of a blastomere (s) of the cleavage stage embryo can accommodate the loss of cells and still generate normal embryos. The extraordinary adaptability and robustness of the system beg the question of what mechanism governs the earliest cell lineage decision-making process in mammals. Time-lapse microscopy has been used to study lineage allocation in unmanipulated mouse embryos. Results show that 95% of cells maintained their position after the 32-cell stage, and the identity of the remaining 5% of cells was unknown. Independently, by carefully following the movement of each cell between 8-32-cell stages, it was found that an average of 1.5 cells per embryo move away from the surface of the embryo toward inside during the segregation of ICM and TE cells. These dynamic cell movements suggest that a robust organizational mechanism must exist for both constructing the proper embryonic architecture and correcting organizational mistakes that arise over time from stochastic motion and division of cells.
This work investigates the flexibility of germline gene-encoded antibodies to bind to various antigens, with binding affinity and specificity increasing as antibody genes acquire somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells. The researchers determined the basis for recognition of diverse antigens by antibodies encoded by three VH gene segments and computationally redesigned panels of somatically mutated antibodies to predict antibodies that could engage multiple antigens at once. The Rosetta multi-state design process predicted antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and CDR2 mutations. The predicted sequences closely matched the germline gene sequences, revealing residues that enable polyspecificity, or binding of many unrelated antigens with a common sequence, thereby reversing antibody maturation in silico. This approach captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition, identifying key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework that contribute to polyspecificity in germline antibodies. Computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding, facilitating the development of antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics.
Locusts exhibit two behavioral phases, solitarious and gregarious, with crowded conditions promoting transition to the gregarious phase. A model is constructed to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at the population level, using a partial integrodifferential equation model incorporating the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the individual level. Stability analysis reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large scale transition to the gregarious phase. Numerical simulations provide descriptions of the aggregation's structure and reveal transiently traveling clumps of gregarious insects. This model can help predict and manage locust outbreaks, which can affect vast areas of Northern Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia, causing significant crop damage and economic losses. The study of locust phase change and aggregation behavior can contribute to the development of more effective control strategies for these economically significant pests.
"The fusion of viral membranes is a crucial step in the infection process of many enveloped viruses, and is mediated by viral envelope glycoproteins. Although high-resolution structures of these fusion proteins in their pre- and post-fusion conformations are available, intermediate structures of the fusion pathway are difficult to define due to their transient nature. Flaviviruses, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus, possess a class II viral fusion protein (E) that is converted from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin-like structure during the fusion process. A study found that exposure of virions to alkaline instead of acidic pH traps the particles in an intermediate conformation where the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. This sequence of events provides important new insights for understanding the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion. Membrane fusion processes are tightly regulated by specific control proteins in both viral and cellular fusion systems. Viral fusion proteins are present in a metastable conformation at the surface of mature virions and undergo structural rearrangements to drive the merger of the viral membrane with a membrane of the target cell when exposed to an appropriate trigger. A common property of viral fusion proteins is the presence of a fusion peptide that inserts into the cellular membrane to initiate the fusion process. Distinct structural classes of viral fusion proteins have been identified, displaying radically different architectures and organizations on the virion. Despite the overall different architecture of fusion protein classes, certain similarities in their overall postfusion conformation suggest that the corresponding fusion processes are mechanistically related. A key feature in this context is the formation of a ""hairpin""-like trimeric postfusion structure, bringing into contact the C-terminal membrane anchor with the target-membrane inserted FP."
We are currently experiencing an extinction event comparable to those recorded in the fossil record, with present-day extinction rates significantly higher than background rates and projected to increase further. Vertebrates' biological traits, such as body size, fecundity, and geographic range, influence their vulnerability. However, our understanding of plant extinctions and vulnerabilities is lagging, despite their critical role as the basis of life on Earth. A study focused on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, reveals that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk in plants differs from that of vertebrates, and cannot be explained by simple biological traits. Instead, the most threatened plant species are those that cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogenetic tree, possibly due to rapid speciation. These findings have significant implications for conservation priorities and challenge the utility of current Red List criteria for plants. Rapid biodiversity loss, driven mainly by habitat loss, fragmentation, and climate change, is the most significant ecological challenge we face. Identifying key traits linked to high extinction risk is crucial for predicting future declines and implementing preemptive conservation measures. However, the particular attributes influencing vulnerability can differ among clades and geographic regions, and current knowledge of plant extinctions is much poorer than for vertebrates. In the Cape, extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Consequently, conservation efforts must focus on reducing species loss rates and carefully consider the most sensible conservation strategies for plants and animals.
Phagocytosis is a crucial process by which cells of the innate immune system eliminate pathogens, and it is vital in preventing Candida albicans infections. Dectin-1 is the major phagocytic receptor involved in anti-fungal immunity, and two new interacting proteins of Dectin-1 in macrophages, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1, have been identified. These proteins are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae but are absent from mature phagosomes. BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in both zymosan and C. albicans phagocytosis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages that lack BTK or Vav1 show reduced uptake of C. albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild type mice. This work highlights the important role of BTK and Vav1 in immune responses against C. albicans.
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans, caused by RVF virus (RVFV). It has been a significant issue in Madagascar, with major outbreaks in 1990-91 and 2008-09. A recent study aimed to identify environmental factors and areas favorable to RVFV transmission to both cattle and humans, as well as human behaviors that contribute to the spread in the Malagasy context. The study used Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models, analyzing cattle and human serological data collected nationwide.The study identified that cattle and human seroprevalence rates were positively associated with humid environments (p<0.001). Areas with high cattle density were also at risk (p<0.01; OR = 2.6). Additionally, frequent contact with raw milk contributed to explaining human infection (OR = 1.6). The study highlighted the eastern-coast, western, and north-western parts as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle.The findings suggest that both vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintaining RVF enzootic transmission. Vectorial transmission probably occurs in both cattle and humans in the suitable eastern-coast, western, and north-western areas for Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes. The relative contribution of vectorial or direct transmissions could be further assessed by mathematic modeling. The association between cattle seroprevalence, humid environments, and high cattle density indicates that cattle are an essential factor in RVFV transmission and might be a useful indicator for RVF risk assessment.
Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that can transmit between non-identical proteins, though this is often inefficient. This inefficiency is attributed to sequence differences in prion proteins, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. A study using a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based experimental system found that Rnq1 encompasses multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. Transmission of the prion state between different Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants established that one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission, but despite identical sequences of the common QNs, such transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. This indicates that in complex prion domains, multiple prion determinants act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, revealing transmission barriers determined by this cooperative fold.
A novel likelihood-free inference framework using deep learning is introduced to compute the likelihood of complex population genetic models, which is often infeasible. Deep learning is a powerful modern technique in machine learning that uses multilayer neural networks to learn a feature-based function from the input to the output. This method can effectively infer population genetic parameters and learn informative features of data. The authors focus on the challenging problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography, which is demonstrated on 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia. The results show many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps and fewer under selection on standing variation or balancing selection. Additionally, soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. Furthermore, the authors find that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme. Overall, this study shows that deep learning can effectively be employed for population genetic inference and learning informative features of data.
High-risk HPV oncogenes, especially HPV16, play a crucial role in the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. A persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes, E6 and E7, is necessary for the formation of these cancers. These cells expressing E6 and E7 have been found to be hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL). The E6 and E7 oncoproteins attenuate the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA crosslink repair pathway, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Although E6 and E7 activated the FA pathway, they inhibited the completion of the repair by impairing FancD2 colocalization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering the recruitment of downstream protein Rad51 to DSB, and causing delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination. The increased chromatin retention of FancD2 hinders USP1 de-ubiquitinating activity and persistently activates ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling. E6-mediated p53 degradation does not hamper the cell cycle specific process of FancD2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting FancD2 de-ubiquitination. Further, E6 reduces the expression and foci formation of Palb2, which is a repair protein downstream of FancD2. These findings provide insight into how HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies.
The Southern Chiapas focus in Mexico is one of the major onchocerciasis foci in Latin America, with 559 endemic communities having undergone semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin since 1998. In 2003, the treatment frequency shifted from twice to four times a year in 50 communities and was further extended to 113 communities in 2009. Extensive epidemiological and entomological assessments were conducted in six sentinel and three extra-sentinel communities, all of which had undergone at least two rounds of ivermectin treatment per year. The results showed that none of the 67,924 Simulium ochraceum s.l. flies collected during the dry season of 2011 were found to contain parasite DNA, resulting in an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95%-ULCI) of the infective rate in the vectors of 0.06/2,000 flies examined. Moreover, serological assays on 4,230 children aged five years and under (out of a total population of 10,280 in this age group) revealed that only two individuals were exposed to O. volvulus (0.05%; one-sided 95% confidence interval=0.08%). The in-depth epidemiological and entomological findings from the Southern Chiapas focus meet the criteria for interruption of transmission established by the international community.
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that can cause serious invasive disease in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The bacterium can survive as a saprophyte in soil but can transition into a pathogen following ingestion by mammalian hosts. The transition is coordinated by the central virulence regulatory protein, PrfA, which regulates the expression of gene products associated with bacterial virulence. A study has identified a lipoprotein, PplA, that is secreted in increased amounts following PrfA activation and shares homology with a peptide pheromone-encoding lipoprotein in Enterococcus faecalis. The L. monocytogenes genome encodes for gene products that share homology with E. faecalis proteins required for peptide pheromone processing, import, and transcriptional regulation. The pPplA peptide pheromone contributes to intracellular growth and bacterial virulence. Bacterial cultures of prfA* strains exhibit bacterial settling and/or aggregation, and the pPplA pheromone contributes to this aggregation. The CtaP oligopeptide transport system may be involved in the import of the pPplA pheromone into the bacterial cell to stimulate bacterial aggregation following PrfA activation. The secretion of the PplA lipoprotein is increased following PrfA activation, and mutant strains lacking the PplA lipoprotein, the pheromone and lipoprotein, and the Eep protease show attenuated virulence in a mouse infection model.
Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera, is highly adaptable and can colonize hostile environments, including the human small intestine. To understand how V. cholerae combats reactive oxygen species (ROS) during infection, a study used whole-genome transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) to analyze gene requirements for colonization in mice with and without the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). The study found that mutants of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, such as MutS, had significant colonization advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in NAC-treated mice. Further analysis suggested that the accumulation of catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in NAC- mice was the leading cause of mutS mutant enrichment caused by oxidative stress during infection. The mutation rate of wildtype colonized in NAC- mice was significantly higher than that in NAC+ mice. The study supports a paradigm in which V. cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. V. cholerae is a versatile bacterium that can survive in both aquatic and host environments. To cope with harsh conditions during the transition to the host gut and during subsequent growth, V. cholerae senses host signals and coordinates both virulence gene activation and repression to evade host defenses and successfully colonize intestines. Late in the infection, V. cholerae optimally modulates its genetic programs for the forthcoming dissemination into the aquatic environment. In the aquatic environment, V. cholerae forms biofilms, which provide protection from environmental stresses, including nutrient limitation, protozoa predation, and bacteriophage infection.One of the major stresses V. cholerae must overcome is exposure to ROS. Reactive compounds, including ROS, are abundant in marine systems, and V. cholerae encounters oxidative stress during the later stages of infection. Catalases, peroxiredoxin, organic hydroperoxide resistance protein, a redox-regulated chaperone, and a DNA-binding protein from starved cells are important for V. cholerae ROS resistance. ROS resistance in V. cholerae is tightly regulated through a variety of mechanisms, including the quorum sensing systems, PhoB/PhoR two-component systems, and the virulence regulator, AphB.Further identifying bacterial stress responses to host-derived ROS is important for understanding V. cholerae pathogenesis. In this study, the researchers used Tn-seq to screen for V. cholerae genes that are involved in ROS resistance during infection. By comparing colonization in control mice to mice treated with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) that reduces the production of ROS in murine intestines, the study found that deletion of mutS, encoding a key component in the DNA methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, results in a significant colonization advantage compared to wildtype in ROS-rich mice. This finding suggests that the MMR system is important for maintaining the overall stability of the genetic material and that inactivation of the MMR system leads to better adaptation and persistence of V. cholerae in murine models.
Mlh1-Mlh3 is an endonuclease that plays a major role in meiotic crossing over and a minor role in eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR), with its activity stimulated by Msh2-Msh3 in MMR. An analysis of 60 mlh3 alleles in baker's yeast revealed that five specifically disrupted MMR, while one (mlh3-32) specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. Both Mlh1-mlh3-32 and Mlh1-mlh3-45 displayed wild-type endonuclease activities in vitro, but Msh2-Msh3 stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions. Whole genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type and MMR+ crossover-, MMR- crossover+, endonuclease defective and null mlh3 mutants in an S288c/YJM789 hybrid background. All of the mlh3 mutants showed increases in the number of noncrossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative recombination pathways. These observations provide a structure-function map for Mlh3 that reveals the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3’s enzymatic activity and illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights for how meiotic recombination pathways are regulated.
The intense use of antibiotics to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus, and gonorrhea has led to increasing population levels of drug resistance. This has resulted in a need to switch to new drugs and discontinue older ones, but resistance often persists even after the discontinuation of these drugs. This is usually attributed to low fitness costs of resistance in the absence of the drug. However, a new study shows that the structure of the host population, specifically heterogeneity in the number of contacts, also plays a significant role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure affects the distribution of the resistant strain among the infected population during the phase of intense treatment and the competition dynamics after the discontinuation of the drug, leading to a slower reversion rate and a lower probability of reversion to sensitivity at the population level. The impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is greatest in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small. This suggests that host contact structure should be taken into account when studying the evolution of resistance in the context of treatment.
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are complex neurodevelopmental diseases with deficits in social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviors. While some highly penetrant gene variants have been identified, there is growing evidence that combinatorial effects from multiple loci contribute to ASDs. A study using Drosophila models found synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes whose orthologues are affected by large de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with ASD, including a patient carrying a 22q11.2 deletion. These CNVs affect genes operating in the same functional pathway/network and simultaneously affect multiple genes whose proteins interact within that functional pathway. Combinatorial effects of these genes’ copy number change likely causally contribute to patients’ autistic phenotypes. The study illustrates mechanisms through which synergistic effects resulting from large structural variation can contribute to human disease, highlighting the importance of understanding gene-gene interactions in ASD.
In the study of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), a severe neurological syndrome induced by Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in C57BL/6 mice, it was found that brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells play a central role in its development. However, the mechanisms through which they mediate their pathogenic activity during malaria infection are not well understood. The study used intravital two-photon microscopy and ex vivo flow cytometric analysis to show that brain-infiltrating T cells accumulate within the perivascular spaces of brains of mice infected with both ECM-inducing (P. berghei ANKA) and non-inducing (P. berghei NK65) infections. However, perivascular T cells displayed an arrested behavior specifically during P. berghei ANKA infection, and formed long-term cognate interactions with CX3CR1-bearing antigen presenting cells within the brains during P. berghei ANKA infection. Pathogenic CD8+ T cells were found to colocalize with rare apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within the brain during ECM. However, cellular apoptosis was a rare event and did not result in loss of cerebral vasculature or correspond with the extensive disruption to its integrity observed during ECM. The arrest of T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique signature of ECM-inducing malaria infection and implies an important role for this event in the development of the ECM-syndrome.Malaria is a significant global health problem with 207 million cases and 584,000-1,238,000 deaths annually. A high proportion of these deaths are due to cerebral malaria (CM), a neuropathology induced primarily by the species Plasmodium falciparum. Current treatment of cerebral malaria is limited to parasiticidal chemotherapies, and the mortality rate of CM, even after treatment, remains at 10-20%. A greater understanding of the parasitological and immunological events leading to the development of CM would aid the development of improved therapeutic options to treat the condition. Infection of susceptible strains of mice with P. berghei ANKA results in the development of a serious neurological syndrome, termed experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), which recapitulates many of the clinical and pathological features of CM.The study found that CD8+ T cells are crucial in the development of cerebral pathology, and protection from ECM is afforded by their depletion as late as one day prior to the development of neurological signs. The pathogenic parasite-specific CD8+ T cells are primed in the spleen by CD8α+ dendritic cells (DCs) before migrating to the brain through homing dependent upon IFNγ-stimulated CXCL10 production in the CNS. Monocytes play a role in recruitment of the pathogenic CD8+ T cells to the brain during ECM; however, the relative importance of this event in development of cerebral pathology remains undefined. It has previously been shown that parasite-specific CD8+ T cells mediate ECM development through perforin- and granzyme B-dependent mechanisms, yet where the CD8+ T cells localize within the brain to cause ECM has remained unclear. Parasite-specific CD8+ T cells appear to require in situ antigen-dependent stimulation within the brain to program their pathogenic activity necessary for ECM development. To date, however, the identity of the putative antigen cross-presenting cells that interact with pathogenic CD8+ T cells during ECM is unknown.In conclusion, the study suggests that the arrest of T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique signature of ECM-inducing malaria infection and implies an important role for this event in the development of the ECM-syndrome. Understanding the mechanisms through which brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells cause ECM may help in the development of improved therapeutic options to treat cerebral malaria.
Tungiasis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans, is a significant health issue in Vihiga County, Kenya, particularly among lower-income individuals. A study was conducted to determine the burden of tungiasis in the area, examining 437 participants across 21 villages in three sub-locations. The overall prevalence of tungiasis was found to be 21.5% (95% CI: 17.7--25.3%). Multivariate analysis indicated that low economic status, age (≤14 years), lack of regular use of closed footwear, and common resting place inside the house were associated with the occurrence of tungiasis. These findings suggest the need for cost-effective and accessible control strategies for tungiasis in the region. Tungiasis is a neglected tropical disease, primarily affecting populations living in poverty with poor housing, inadequate sanitation, and close contact with domestic animals. Although not officially recognized by the World Health Organization, tungiasis is a health concern in many tropical and subtropical countries. The burden of tungiasis in Kenya is estimated to be between 19% and 40% in affected communities, with children and the elderly being most vulnerable. Factors contributing to the spread of tungiasis include earthen and dusty floors, non-regular use of closed footwear, common resting places outside the house, and the presence of animals in the compound or living with animals in the same house. Understanding the geographical distribution of tungiasis is crucial for improving control measures, as limited resources often require targeting high transmission areas in sub-Saharan Africa. While progress has been made in mapping neglected diseases, there is still a need to understand the geographical distribution and burden of tungiasis to effectively address this ectoparasitosis.
Auxin and cytokinin, two plant hormones, have antagonistic interactions that play a key role in the development of vascular tissues in plants. These tissues are crucial for long-distance transport, structural support, and the formation of wood. The vascular tissues are composed of xylem and phloem, with the xylem axis consisting of protoxylem and metaxylem cells. Protoxylem specification is an early event in post-embryonic vascular patterning, and it has been suggested that the correct positioning and specification of protoxylem depends on a mutually inhibitory interaction between auxin and cytokinins. However, the relevance and plausibility of an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels in this context remains unclear. Cytokinin has been shown to regulate auxin transport, and this regulation plays a central role in protoxylem specification. Auxin transport depends on the activity of molecular transporters, including the PIN class of efflux carriers, which are polarly localized within cells and play a crucial role in determining the overall auxin distribution and flux pattern. Computational modelling has been used to investigate how cytokinin signalling modifies the auxin distribution and flux via the PIN transporters in the Arabidopsis root tip and explore the possible functional consequences. These models have revealed that cytokinin signalling is essential for correct vascular patterning and that auxin accumulation activates AHP6 expression at the protoxylem position, which in turn inhibits cytokinin signalling, resulting in a feedback loop that positions the xylem axis in Arabidopsis. The patterns in cytokinin signalling are a combined consequence of both the spatial distribution in the levels of cytokinin and the strength with which individual cells respond to those levels of cytokinin. Computational modelling has also been used to investigate auxin-cytokinin interactions in a realistic spatial context, which has uncovered a mechanism by which regulated transverse auxin transport increases the robustness of the xylem-axis maximum and impinges on lateral root initiation.
The study of gene expression changes in neural systems and their role in environment-induced behavioral plasticity in animals has revealed that the neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway plays a regulatory role in phase-related locomotor plasticity in migratory locusts. A conserved transcription factor, CREB-B, has been identified as a key mediator in this signaling pathway, triggering locomotor activity shift between solitarious and gregarious phases. CREB-B directly activates brain NOS expression by interacting with the NOS promoter region, and its phosphorylation at the serine 110 site dynamically changes in response to population density variation, which is negatively controlled by NPF2. The regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription are mediated by protein kinase A. These findings highlight a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in metazoans is a critical period in development, during which there is a shift from control of development by maternally contributed mRNAs and proteins to control by the zygotic genome. The MZT is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes. The zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in the transcriptional activation of these genes. A study using ChIP-Seq to map regions bound by ZLD before, during, and after the MZT in Drosophila found that ZLD is bound to thousands of regions before the MZT, many of which are also bound by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is so strong that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This strong early association of ZLD with regions not active until the MZT suggests that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT. Delayed activation of the zygotic genome during the early phases of embryogenesis is a nearly universal phenomenon in metazoans. The zygotic genome is largely transcriptionally quiescent immediately following egg activation, with development controlled by maternally contributed mRNAs and proteins. At a point known as the MZT, the degradation of maternally provided RNAs is tightly coordinated with widespread initiation of zygotic transcription. In Drosophila melanogaster, the fertilized egg undergoes a series of replication cycles without cytoplasmic divisions to generate a syncytial blastoderm. During cycle 14, the blastoderm nuclei cellularize and general zygotic transcription is initiated. However, a subset of genes required for sex determination, pattern formation and cellularization are transcribed as early as cycle 8. These genes share a common set of related heptameric DNA motifs, CAGGTAG and related “TAGteam” elements, in their regulatory regions. The zinc-finger transcription factor Zelda (ZLD) is the most important factor in regulating early gene expression, and mutations in zld lead to defects in early embryonic mitosis and severe cellularization defects by mitotic cycle 14. A microarray study of ZLD-depleted embryos identified 120 genes whose proper expression during early embryogenesis is dependent on ZLD, but the full range of ZLD targets and its mechanisms of action are not known.
Circadian clocks, present in most living organisms, regulate important physiological processes and behaviors through precise timing of gene expression, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and post-transcriptional/posttranslational modifications. A yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screen revealed 109 novel PPIs among circadian clock proteins, including the interaction of protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1 resulting in BMAL1 destabilization. A dynamic circadian PPI network was constructed, predicting PPI timing using circadian expression data. Systems analysis of a global dynamic network in liver revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, restricting regulatory interactions to specific phases. Many important cellular processes, such as signal transduction and cell cycle, are predicted to be dynamically connected by circadian PPIs, contributing to the temporal organization of cellular physiology. Further investigation of these PPIs and their dynamics is essential to understand the regulation of circadian output processes and the control of cellular physiology.
Nematode polyprotein allergens (NPAs) are an unusual class of lipid-binding proteins found in nematodes, synthesized as large tandemly repetitive polyproteins and post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of small lipid binding proteins. They are crucial for transport and distribution of small hydrophobic compounds in nematodes and may play key roles in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE antibody-based responses in infection. The structure of ABA-1A, the most common repeating unit of the NPA of Ascaris suum, was determined by protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and adopts a novel seven-helical fold. NPAs have no counterparts in vertebrates, making them potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. Tandemly repetitive polyproteins (TRPs) are rare in nature, produced as large precursor polypeptides and comprising repeated units of similar or identical amino acid sequence that are post-translationally cleaved into a dozen or so copies of functionally similar proteins. TRPs represent an efficient and economical means of synthesizing large quantities of a functional protein. NPAs are produced in large quantities by parasitic nematodes and have affinity for small lipids, crucial for safe movement within cells and acquisition, protection, and distribution of lipids for parasitic nematodes. Immunological responses to NPAs have been associated with naturally-acquired resistance to infection in humans and are under strict genetic control. These immune responses have shown potential as vaccine candidates.
Ciguatera, a type of fish poisoning that occurs in tropical regions, particularly in developing Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), has seen a 60% increase in annual incidence between 1998-2008, with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people, potentially affecting half a million Pacific islanders in the last 35 years. Ciguatera is caused by the consumption of coral reef fish contaminated by ciguatoxin from dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. The disease is prevalent in tropical and subtropical waters, particularly in PICTs, and is under-diagnosed and under-reported. Ciguatera has been linked to military activities, coral reef damage, and climate change, which exacerbate the extent and range of the disease. Despite extensive research, little is known about the ecology and environmental factors that cause the blooms of ciguatera-causative organisms. Effective management of ciguatera is hampered by the inability to detect ciguatoxin in fish and Gambierdiscus in routine testing, and the reliance on symptom-based diagnosis in humans. Increased degradation of coastal marine environments, coastal development, and land run-off, as well as global climate change, are predicted to increase the incidence of ciguatera cases in the future. Therefore, it is hypothesized that ciguatera incidence is an increasing human health and ecological concern across the PICTs. Continued research, education campaigns, improved toxin detection, and a better understanding of the environmental factors contributing to ciguatera are required to help reduce the adverse impacts of ciguatera.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a significant public health issue in Latin America and globally. The main treatment is benznidazole (BNZ), which has side effects and whose effectiveness during the chronic phase is controversial. However, studies suggest that BNZ can improve the immune system's capacity against the parasite and prevent the development of cardiomyopathy during the chronic phase. A study of 38 chronic Chagas disease patients (18 symptomatic and 20 asymptomatic) and 12 healthy donors found that CD4+CD8+ T cells were more frequent in chronic Chagas disease patients, with a higher ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations compared to healthy donors. These cells expressed and co-expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors in proportion to the severity of the pathology. BNZ treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells and decreased the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations. The co-expression level of inhibitory receptors was reduced after treatment, accompanied by an improvement in the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells and an increase in the frequency of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α. CD4+CD8+ T cells have an important role in controlling T. cruzi infection, and BNZ treatment can partially reverse the exhaustion process caused by T. cruzi infection in these cells and improve their functional response. Therefore, identifying biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy is crucial for monitoring treated patients and understanding the role of all immune system components involved in T. cruzi infection control. T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a crucial role in Chagas disease control. However, further studies are required to understand the functions of other T cell components, such as CD4+CD8+ peripheral T cells, which represent approximately 3% of lymphocytes in human blood. These cells have the potential to be activated and respond to specific antigens, produce cytokines and cytotoxic molecules, and migrate to inflamed tissues. In the context of Chagas disease, CD4+CD8+ T cells respond to T. cruzi antigens, express greater amounts of activation markers and perforin than healthy subjects, and are found in the inflammatory infiltrate of cardiac tissue from a patient who underwent cardiac transplant, suggesting they could play an important role in the control of Chagas disease. However, the study of the population of CD4+CD8+ T cells in chronic Chagas disease has not yet been explored in detail, and understanding their ability to respond to T. cruzi antigens and the mechanism underlying the exhaustion process in these T cells can lead to the identification of new biomarkers that can be used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of known and new drugs and improve knowledge concerning all components of the immune system that play a key role in the control of T. cruzi infection.
Phosphoinositides are important lipid signals in plant development and stress response, but the specific enzymes and roles in the biosynthetic pathway are not well understood due to multiple isoforms of the genes. A study in Arabidopsis thaliana found that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) is the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism and is involved in seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. Lipidomic profiling of multiple plc mutants showed that the plc2-1 mutant had increased levels of its substrates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate, indicating that the major phosphoinositide metabolic pathway is impaired. AtPLC2 displayed a distinct tissue expression pattern and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types, where phosphoinositide signaling occurs. Seedlings of the plc2-1 mutant showed growth defects and hypersensitive response to ER stress, suggesting that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity borne by AtPLC2 is required for seedling growth and ER stress response. This study reveals the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism, its involvement in seedling growth and an emerging link between phosphoinositide and the ER stress response.
"Reductionism in science typically assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, with coarser causal models seen as approximations due to limitations in measurement or computation. However, a study utilizing a measure of intrinsic cause-effect power (integrated information, or Φ) challenges this assumption. The study evaluates simple systems for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales, considering all possible ""black boxes"" - macro elements consisting of micro elements over micro updates. By examining the inputs and outputs of these black boxes and ignoring internal micro elements, the study reveals that macro levels can ""beat"" the micro level in terms of cause-effect power. High-order mechanisms and joint constraints not apparent at the micro level emerge, resulting in a macro system having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration), leading to a higher Φ value. This challenges the reductionist assumption and provides a framework for identifying stable local maxima during a system's biological function, offering a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries."
A rule-based model of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) was extended to account for electron transport in the whole RC coupled to proton translocation, TCA cycle reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. This model was used to fit respiratory electron fluxes and the dynamics of NAD+ reduction in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate. The analysis revealed an association of ROS production with levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in species of complexes I and III, and confirmed the phenomenon of bistability for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted based on theoretical analysis and confirmed experimentally. These findings provide a new insight into the mechanisms of ROS production in RC and can be useful for advances in transplantology and therapy.
Intracellular transport in eukaryotic cells is facilitated by motor proteins, which convert chemical energy into kinetic energy to enable unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long distances. Disruptions in these transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations that alter single motor characteristics, can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. A recent study investigates the effects of mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. The results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. A semi-analytic method is developed to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types, which can be used to model mutations and deduce effects of such alterations on transport. These findings are important for understanding how mutant motors impact intracellular transport and lead to onset of diseases. Specifically, recent studies have implied that alterations in the kinesin-1 motor domain may have a role in impaired axonal transport, and phosphorylation of a mammal kinesin motor domain by kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase-3 ( JNK3 ) at a conserved serine residue is implicated in Huntington’s disease. A negative charge at this serine residue leads to a lower stall force and decreased velocity under external loads, while leaving ATPase, microtubule-binding affinity, and processivity unchanged. A recent experimental study reported that a negative charge at Ser-175, acquired through mutation or phosphorylation, leads to a lower stall force and decreased velocity under external loads of 1 pN or more, while leaving ATPase, microtubule-binding affinity, and processivity unchanged. A separate contribution of the article is a semi-analytical method for determining the probability distribution of various configurations of a cargo carried by multiple number and types of motor-proteins. However, observing the transport dynamics of multiple motors is experimentally challenging due to the combinatorial complexity introduced by the multitude of scenarios possible when many motors and motor types participate in transport. Therefore, analytical and computational tools are used to study the transport of cargo by multiple motors. The Master Equation based method analytically solves for the probability distributions of all possible scenarios at any time point and enables the calculation of various biologically relevant quantities such as average velocity and run-length, for reasonably sized ensembles and with high accuracy while using lesser computational resources and time as compared to Monte Carlo simulations. This method can be used to study the transport of cargo by multiple motors of two different types where each type of motor protein can be individually characterized by a probabilistic model describing its stepping, detachment and attachment rates. For this article, the technique has been utilized to introduce alterations of various parameters from the nominal ones to model a mutation of the serine residue and compute the effect of such a mutation on cargo carried by a mixture of wild-type and mutant motor-proteins. In summary, a simulation engine was developed to study the transport of cargo by multiple motor proteins with distinct properties that in concert can exhibit emergent transport behaviors.
The study found that behavioral experiments are designed to test specific cognitive functions, but animals may use various individual behavioral strategies to solve tasks. Learning is seen as the selection and adaptation of potential behavioral policies. The research focused on the Cacna1c gene, which is associated with learning deficits and psychiatric disorders. A selective functional ablation of the Cacna1c gene showed that the knockout mice did not impair learning in general. Instead, the majority of Cacna1c knockout mice still managed to increase reward feedback across trials but did so by adapting an outcome-based strategy, while the majority of matched controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule. This reveals a specific role of a single gene in learning and highlights that much more mechanistic insight could be gained by examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. The results may also have clinical implications for treating psychiatric disorders.In summary, animal learning is a complex process that relies on a variety of behavioral strategies, and learning may not be impaired but instead shifted towards different strategies. The research on the Cacna1c gene and its impact on learning further supports the idea that a single gene can play a specific role in learning and behavior. These findings have the potential to contribute to the development of new treatments for learning disorders and psychiatric conditions.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which transmit diseases like dengue and Zika, are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. Wolbachia bacteria are being used as a potential method to control these diseases by reducing the mosquitoes' ability to transmit the viruses. Wolbachia are maternally transmitted bacteria that can manipulate their host's reproduction and inhibit the replication of RNA viruses in insects. However, the success of Wolbachia interventions may depend on environmental conditions, particularly temperature. A study found that rearing Ae. aegypti larvae infected with certain Wolbachia strains (wMel and wMelPop-CLA) at fluctuating and extreme temperatures reduced the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility and the density of Wolbachia, and prevented the transmission of the bacteria to the next generation. The wAlbB strain, however, was able to maintain a high density, exhibit complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with a high fidelity under the same temperature cycle. These findings highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing and the potential impact of environmental conditions on the success of Wolbachia interventions.
Adenoviruses are important human pathogens that have been developed as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines. Previous studies have shown that human infections with adenoviruses are self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts, with some evidence of persistence in adenoid tissue. A recent study investigated the natural history of adenovirus infections in various non-human primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in stool. Stool samples from asymptomatic humans showed less frequent shedding, comparable to frequencies reported before. The study also purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 from macaques, and analyzed their sequences together with 22 complete adenovirus genomes available from GenBank. The results showed that ape adenoviruses could be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E, and there was evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses. The high degree of phylogenetic relatedness of adenoviruses across their various primate hosts provided evidence for cross species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E viruses. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing. Furthermore, the presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors.
The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a nucleus in the form of chromatin, with the nucleosome being the fundamental structural unit. A nucleosome is a protein-DNA complex consisting of 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.75 times around an octameric histone core. However, for proper gene function, this nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped at least partially. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with enhanced sampling methods have been used to investigate the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. The results showed that the free energy change for unwrapping is about 11.5 kcal/mol, which agrees well with values obtained in single molecule experiments. The simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating there are many potential paths to outer superhelical turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. The unwrapping occurs in stages, with different base pairs being unwrapped at each stage. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes during cellular processes. MD simulations and umbrella sampling were used to estimate the free energy cost of unwrapping a total of 44 bps, corresponding to nearly the entire outer DNA, to be about 11.5 kcal/mol. This value is quite reasonable compared with reported values and indicates that the unwrapping of the outer DNA from nucleosomes has a significant energy cost.
ApoD, a lipid binding protein, is crucial for maintaining lysosomal membrane integrity and regulating lysosomal pH homeostasis upon oxidative stress. It is internalized and targeted to lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner, preventing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and it is necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization. Lysosomal dysfunction is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, and maintaining lysosomal membrane stability is essential for cell survival. ApoD has been found to optimize autophagy in neurodegeneration-triggered conditions in Drosophila, slowing down the process and making it more efficient, potentially minimizing the negative effects of autophagic stress. These findings suggest that Lipocalins, including ApoD, play a significant role in lysosomal membrane integrity and pH homeostasis, opening therapeutic opportunities for lysosome-related disorders.
Phlebotomus orientalis Parrot, the primary vector of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani in East Africa, was studied through two of its colonies from different locations in Ethiopia: Melka Werer (MW), a non-endemic site in the lowlands, and Addis Zemen (AZ), an endemic VL focus in the highlands. While life-cycle parameters varied between the two colonies and RAPD PCR, cytB, and COI mitochondrial genes showed no genetic differences, F1 hybrids developed with higher fecundity. Both colonies demonstrated susceptibility to Ethiopian L. donovani strains, with an average blood-meal volume of 0.7 µl and an infective dose as low as one or two L. donovani promastigotes per sand fly blood-meal. The distribution of P. orientalis seems to favor Acacia - Balanites forests, cracks of black cotton clay soil, and termite hills. Despite attempts, colonization and laboratory maintenance of P. orientalis have proven difficult. These findings suggest that differences in VL prevalence are not due to P. orientalis susceptibility to L. donovani but possibly to human, reservoir host, or environmental factors. Further research is required to establish actual breeding sites and factors influencing colonization success.
The Chinese government considers advanced schistosomiasis, a chronic disease caused by a blood fluke, a top healthcare priority due to its serious health and economic impacts. However, it has not been included in the estimates of schistosomiasis burden in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. To address this, a study was conducted to estimate the disability weight (DW) of advanced schistosomiasis japonica, the most common and severe form of the disease in China. The study used a patient-based quality-of-life evaluation and the European quality of life questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension, ultrasonography, and laboratory testing to assess disability and morbidity in confirmed cases. The results showed that most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall DW was 0.447, and age-specific DWs ranged from 0.378 among individuals aged 30–44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged ≥60 years. These estimates could provide updated data for a revision of the GBD and for evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program.
Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT), also known as sleeping sickness and nagana, respectively, are parasitic vector-borne diseases prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. Transmitted through the tsetse fly, HAT affects humans, while AAT impacts animals, although the two conditions are interconnected. Historically, HAT has been addressed through active surveillance programs in specific countries, resulting in a decline in cases. However, much of rural sub-Saharan Africa lacks HAT-diagnostic capacity and passive surveillance programs, making it challenging to estimate population prevalence outside of active case-finding areas. A retrospective-cross-sectional study in Kenya used national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in seven tsetse belts, where tsetse vectors for HAT and AAT are present. The study found that incorporating reports on disability from the national census is a promising surveillance tool for enhancing future HAT surveillance programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a compound that reactivates viral production in chronically infected cell lines. It does so through an NF-kB-independent activation of HIV transcription. HMBA induces viral production in a dose-dependent manner in cells from monocytic and lymphocytic lineages. It increases the expression of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2, which, along with 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA), inhibit and sequester the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in its transcriptionally inactive complex (large complex [LC]). P-TEFb is responsible for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and negative transcription elongation factors, and is predominantly bound to Brd4 or is in a free heterodimeric form. HMBA disrupts the LC, resulting in cellular differentiation and the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter to stimulate viral transcription elongation. This disruption of the LC is transient, and the reassociation of P-TEFb with HEXIM1 is more efficient than the reassociation with HEXIM2. HMBA activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to the concomitant disruption of the LC and the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter. The inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway or the expression of a mutant HEXIM1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt and is resistant to HMBA-mediated disruption of the LC antagonizes the induction of HIV transcription by HMBA. Therefore, HMBA releases P-TEFb to reactivate viral production from latency by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and disrupting the LC.
Leishmaniasis is a protozoan parasitic disease affecting 12 million people worldwide, with 350 million at risk. It has two major forms: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). New World Leishmania (Viannia) species cause CL, which can lead to mucosal (ML) or disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The hyperinflammatory immune response causing this aggressive phenotype is associated with a parasite dsRNA virus (LRV). A study demonstrated LRV's role in elevated parasitemia, destructive inflammation, and disease exacerbation. Improved LRV detection and quantitation methods without sequence prerequisites are crucial. An anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody, J2, specifically recognizes dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner, increasing diagnostic potential. Refining these methods for field use could aid LRV detection, assessing complication risks, and monitoring disease progression.
"EPEC and EHEC are closely-related pathogens that cause actin pedestal formation on intestinal epithelial cells, but they use different mechanisms to trigger pedestal formation. EPEC uses the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHEC uses the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU. Both strains form macrocolonies that encompass multiple host cells, and Tir, EspFU, and the host Arp2/3 complex are critical for the expansion of macrocolonies. EspFU accelerates the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drives faster bacterial motility to cell junctions. The ability to form macrocolonies enhances epithelial colonization and allows for efficient cell-to-cell transmission. The mechanisms by which pedestals promote colonization and disease remain unclear, but pedestals may play a role in anti-phagocytosis, bacterial motility, and epithelial cell colonization. EPEC and EHEC pedestals serve similar functions with respect to resisting phagocytosis by macrophages and enabling actin-based motility on non-polarized cells. However, on polarized epithelial cells, EHEC pedestals confer a colonization advantage, allowing for the formation of large ""macrocolonies"" that encompass several host cells, providing an EHEC-specific advantage stemming from faster EspFU-driven motility and a previously unrecognized mechanism of cell-to-cell bacterial transfer."
The isolation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from other excretory-secretory products is crucial for downstream studies and application development in helminth pathogens, including the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. The most widely used purification method for EVs in helminth pathogens is differential centrifugation (DC), but there is no agreed research community 'gold standard' for EV isolation. This case study compares DC and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for EV purification from Fasciola hepatica. EVs prepared by SEC were smaller in size and less diverse than those resolved by DC, and demonstrated a higher EV purity to free excretory-secretory protein (ESP) yield ratio. Proteomic analysis further highlighted DC contamination from ESP in DC-prepared EVs, with a greater diversity of protein identifications and unique peptide hits compared to SEC-prepared EVs. Additionally, SEC-purified EVs contained fewer tegumental-based proteins than DC-purified EVs. Therefore, SEC methods should be considered for EV purification prior to downstream studies, as certain DC protocols may include more free ES proteins and tegumental artefacts.
Systems biology uses a cycle of experiment and modeling, including reverse engineering to fit models to data and infer regulatory mechanisms. This is challenging in a complex biological context, and requires rigorous methods to determine if model parameters can be properly identified. The authors use reverse engineering to study post-transcriptional regulation in pattern formation, specifically analyzing the expression of the gap genes Krüppel, knirps, and giant in Drosophila melanogaster. They find that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. They demonstrate that the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation, which has implications for the study of development and other complex biological processes. Reverse engineering approaches involve formulating a mathematical model, fitting it to data, and analyzing the output to gain biological insight. However, there are challenges in deciding what kind of data and model are needed for a successful fit, and in analyzing whether a given solution is specific and reliable. Mathematical methods can be used to establish whether a reverse-engineering problem is well-posed and able to produce a unique and consistent solution. These methods include structural (a priori) parameter identifiability analysis, practical (a posteriori) parameter identifiability analysis, and optimal experimental design. However, the application of these methods to gain specific and novel biological insights is limited by the complexity of most real-world biological regulatory systems and the nature of the data used in reverse-engineering studies. The authors present a case study combining model fitting by global optimization strategies with rigorous structural and practical identifiability analysis, applied to the dynamics of spatio-temporal pattern formation in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. They investigate the role of post-transcriptional regulation within the context of the gap gene network involved in segment determination during the blastoderm stage of early fly development. They find that post-transcriptional regulation is required for the accurate control of gap protein levels, with specific predictions about the timing of translational efficiency and protein stability.
Rotavirus is a significant cause of diarrhea in human children, particularly affecting infants younger than six years, while adults remain asymptomatic. The virus exhibits a marked cell tropism for epithelial cells of the small intestine and causes significant destruction of the neonatal epithelium. In a study using an oral mouse infection model, it was found that the innate immune receptor for viral dsRNA, Toll-like receptor (Tlr) 3, was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but strongly increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in Tlr3 or the adaptor molecule Trif exhibited significantly higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes as compared to wild-type animals. These findings suggest that upregulation of epithelial TLR3 expression during infancy might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. This is further supported by the detection of a significant age-dependent increase of TLR3 expression in human small intestinal biopsies.
A study was conducted to investigate the genetic architecture of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) through whole-exome sequencing of 1,039 subjects diagnosed with ASD and 870 control subjects. The sequencing data came from two centers using different methods to produce sequences and call variants. The initial goal was to ensure the distribution of rare variation was similar for data from different centers, which was achieved by filtering called variants by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative to reference reads. Gene-based analyses of association were performed, and it was shown that mega-analysis has better power than meta-analysis. Before analyzing the data for association, the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis was explored. It was found that population structure can confound case-control studies by the clustering of rare variants in ancestry space, but principal component-based analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test statistics with appropriate distributions. However, after using a variety of gene-based tests and both meta- and mega-analysis, no new risk genes for ASD were found in this sample. The results suggest that standard gene-based tests will require much larger samples of cases and controls before being effective for gene discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.
Mycetoma is a chronic infectious granulomatous disease commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, caused by bacteria or fungi with Madurella mycetomatis being the most common causative agent worldwide and in Sudan. The fungus forms grains in tissue, with chitin present in the fungal cell wall. The human immune system responds to chitin exposure by producing chitinases, including chitotriosidase and AMCase, to break down chitin. However, polymorphisms in the genes encoding for these chitinases can result in altered chitinase activity. A study in a Sudanese population found that a polymorphism resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with increased odds of eumycetoma, while no association was found for polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase. The study suggests that decreased chitotriosidase activity is a risk factor for M. mycetomatis mycetoma.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) has served as the prototype for viral latency, characterized by acute or lytic and latent phases. However, recent evidence suggests that lytic genes can be transcribed during latency, challenging the deep quiescence of HSV latency. A study utilized a Cre-marking model to demonstrate that around half of HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred beyond the initial acute infection, and presented direct evidence of lytic promoters driving protein expression during latency. Historically, viral transcription during latency was considered restricted to latency-associated transcripts (LATs), but lytic gene transcription in latency has been noted in sporadic reports. Recent single-cell analysis found lytic gene transcripts in more than two-thirds of all latently-infected neurons, with biologically relevant modulation of host antiviral and survival gene transcription. Although direct evidence for translation of lytic transcripts has been harder to find, activated, virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the sensory ganglia of latently infected individuals provide indirect evidence for the translation of at least some lytic proteins, such as glycoprotein B (gB) and ICP6. Cre-reporter mice, coupled with viruses that express Cre recombinase, serve as a highly sensitive model to detect transient and/or low levels of viral protein production. However, no promoter that drives a major target of anti-HSV CD8+ T cells has been tested. In conclusion, these findings suggest that lytic and latent phases are less clearly defined, with significant implications for understanding HSV latency and reactivation.
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. In prion diseases, the misfolded protein is the prion protein, which forms a protease-resistant form (PrPSc) that accumulates in neurons, astroglia, and microglia in the CNS. A study using mouse scrapie strains with different brain regional pathology found that PrPSc from each strain had a different pattern of cell specificity, mainly associated with astroglia or neurons and neuropil. Despite these differences, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains, correlating with activation of both astroglia and microglia in early disease. The profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed markedly from that seen in two acute viral CNS diseases. Overall, these findings suggest that though the specific cellular associations of misfolded proteins may vary in different prion strains, the inflammatory response is a common feature in prion diseases, and targeting this response could be a potential strategy for therapeutic intervention.
A study discusses the importance of the 3D organization of chromosomes in regulating gene expression and cell function, and the challenges in deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. A generic strategy is proposed to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, taking into account polymer entanglement length and volumic density. The simulation scheme captures the structural and dynamical properties of the system and tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining, offering a significant power-law gain in numerical efficiency. The formalism is used to investigate the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R in drosophila during one cell cycle, showing good agreement with experimental data. The study highlights the importance of accounting for topological constraints in chromosome models, as neglecting them may lead to different structural and dynamical properties.
A recent study aimed to improve the understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs, which are genetic variants that can affect gene expression in a cell type specific manner. The study performed an eQTL analysis in three parts, first identifying eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types, then integrating eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project, and finally building a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The study found that the cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. The study also demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, and the use of CREs from a trait-associated cell type to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. The study concludes that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve the ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.
Achieving a vaccine for HIV has been elusive, but progress has been made in understanding the role of glycosylation in the design and production of an effective vaccine. Many broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) to the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) gp120 recognize epitopes that consist of both amino acid and glycan residues, with glycans being early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. However, suitable cell lines for biopharmaceutical production that limit N-linked glycosylation to mannose-5 (Man5) or earlier intermediates are not readily available, making the production of vaccine immunogens displaying these glycan-dependent epitopes challenging. To address this, a stable suspension-adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line was developed using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing system, which contains a mutation that inactivates the gene encoding Mannosyl (Alpha-1, 3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1, 2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1). This cell line, MGAT1− CHO, produces monomeric gp120s with improved binding to prototypic glycan-dependent bN-mAbs directed to the V1/V2 domain and the V3 stem while preserving the structure of important glycan-independent epitopes. The MGAT1− CHO cell line's ability to limit glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway without impairing the doubling time or ability to grow at high cell densities suggests it will be a useful substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens.
Parasitic nematodes cause devastating diseases in the tropical areas of developing nations, with lymphatic filariasis being a major disease caused by these nematodes. It is a leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. A potential target for therapeutic inhibitor discovery is trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP) from Brugia malayi, which is essential for nematode survival. The X-ray crystal structure of T6PP from B. malayi has been determined, revealing a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2B-type HAD phosphatase fold. Five residues important for binding and catalysis have been identified through structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses using a designed competitive inhibitor, trehalose 6-sulfate. The proposed model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex suggests that high-affinity inhibitors will be bi-dentate, taking advantage of substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl-binding pocket while simultaneously utilizing non-native binding to the trehalose pocket. The conservation of key residues in T6PP enzymes suggests that development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics employing this platform may be possible.
The study presents a novel computational framework that simulates vascular blood flow and interstitial fluid transport in tumors, using whole, realistic tumors extracted ex vivo. The model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, and incorporates spatially heterogeneous blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumor fluid dynamics. The platform enables highly-controlled experiments to be performed, providing insight into how tumor vascular heterogeneity contributes to tumor fluid transport. Sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the key biological mechanisms which determine tumor fluid transport. The model shows that reducing tumor interstitial fluid pressure is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion and that therapies should seek to develop an interstitial fluid pressure gradient. The study also hypothesizes that stabilising vessel diameters and permeabilities are not key responses following vascular normalization and that therapy may alter interstitial hydraulic conductivity. The study suggests that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumors. Overall, the study highlights the importance of incorporating realistic vasculatures in computational models to better understand and predict tumor fluid dynamics and therapy response.
HIV spreads efficiently in vitro through both cell-free and cell-cell transmission modes, but the relative importance of cell-cell transmission in natural infection and its vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies is not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze neutralizing antibody activity during cell-cell transmission using specifically tailored experimental strategies. The results demonstrated that the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and entry inhibitors during cell-cell transmission varies depending on their mode of action. Specifically, gp41-directed agents remain active, while CD4 binding site (CD4bs) directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, dramatically lose potency during cell-cell transmission. This implies that CD4bs mAbs act preferentially through blocking free virus transmission, while still allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts, providing a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs directed antibody responses in vivo. Additionally, this study highlights the complexity of studying HIV transmission modes and the need for further research to fully understand the impact of neutralizing antibodies on cell-cell transmission. This knowledge is crucial for the design of an effective HIV vaccine and entry inhibitor.
The text discusses the effects of visual attention on neural responses and proposes a model to explain these effects. Attention can modulate the responses of visual neurons in various ways, including response-gain, contrast-gain, biased competition, and feature-similarity gain. Attention can also shift and resize receptive fields in topological and feature space. The model proposed in the text suggests that these effects can be explained by a top-down attentional modulation that targets higher levels of the visual system, such as V4 or MT, rather than input areas like V1. The model requires the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. The feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, which in turn alters the inputs of other higher-area cells, producing the observed effects of attention on neural responses. The model can reproduce the observed attentional effects on response rates and receptive field structure without modifying model parameters. The model also makes the novel prediction that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell.
The posterior signaling center (PSC) in Drosophila larvae, a group of specialized cells, controls hemocyte homeostasis in the lymph gland, similar to the niche in vertebrates. The PSC maintains JAK/STAT signaling in hematopoietic progenitors (prohemocytes) to preserve their multipotent character, enabling differentiation into lamellocytes upon wasp parasitism. A short type I cytokine-related receptor, CG14225/Latran, is required to switch off JAK/STAT signaling in prohemocytes for lamellocyte differentiation. Latran forms heteromers with Domeless and antagonizes its activity, leading to a decrease in cytokine mRNA levels and complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signaling upon wasp parasitism. This specific function of Drosophila Latran highlights the potential role of nonsignalling receptors in controlling specific aspects of vertebrate cellular immunity.
Genetic recombination is a key process in the evolution of various virus species, particularly among begomoviruses in the single-stranded DNA virus family Geminiviridae. The patterns of recombination in these viruses are influenced by both basal recombination rates across genomes and the viability of different recombinant genomes. Basal recombination rates are affected by local sequence similarity between recombining genomes, nucleic acid secondary structures, and genomic sensitivity to nuclease attack or breakage. The viability of recombinant genomes is determined by the degree to which their co-evolved protein-protein and protein-nucleotide and nucleotide-nucleotide interactions are disrupted by recombination. An experiment investigating patterns of recombination over 120-day long infections of tomato plants with the begomoviruses Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus found that local degrees of sequence similarity, but not genomic secondary structure, strongly influence where recombination breakpoints occur. Over-all patterns of recombination are influenced by selection against individual recombinants displaying disrupted intra-genomic interactions. The study also found that recombination patterns can be used to identify the exact sequence tracts involved in these interactions and to infer the interaction networks within the virus genomes. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of recombination in virus evolution and the potential implications for the emergence of novel pathogens.
Nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin in eukaryotes, have been suggested to influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, affecting both the rate of DNA mutation and the maintenance or exclusion of nucleosomes in specific locations. Although commonly believed to be unique to eukaryotes, histone proteins have also been discovered in some archaeal genomes, although archaeal nucleosomes differ from their eukaryotic counterparts in several ways, such as forming tetramers rather than octamers and lacking N- and C-terminal tails. Despite these differences, a study has found that the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is conserved between humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. This finding has led researchers to examine whether selection or mutation can explain concordant substitution patterns in the two kingdoms. They found that neither the mutation nor the selection model is sufficient to explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence divergence. Instead, they demonstrate that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are more consistent with a third model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. This finding highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change. Both in vitro and in vivo, nucleosomes are non-randomly positioned with regard to the underlying sequence, forming preferentially on stretches of DNA that are more amenable to being wrapped around the histone core. Consequently, changes at the sequence level during evolution can bring about changes in nucleosome positioning and occupancy, which can locally alter epigenetic states. Epigenetic states can also influence evolution at the sequence level by affecting the efficacy of DNA repair, altering rates of initial lesion formation, and mediating access to promoter elements or transcription factor binding sites, which can disrupt proper access to these functionally important sites if mutations alter nucleosome position.
The native state conformational diversity of proteins plays a crucial role in modulating their function, with different ligands causing shifts in the conformational equilibrium through binding to highest-affinity conformers. The intramolecular vibrational dynamics associated with each conformation enable these conformational transitions, which may be connected to evolutionary conserved traits. A novel procedure has been developed to identify key positions that sustain this conformational diversity associated with ligand binding, using a refined dataset of 188 paired protein structures in their bound and unbound forms. Normal modes most involved in the conformational change are selected and used to analyze the effect of simulated point mutations on preserving the conformational diversity of the protein. Mutations that alter the normal mode subspaces associated with ligand-binding the most are found to be evolutionarily conserved, mostly buried aliphatic residues localized in regular structural regions of the protein like β-sheets and α-helices. Molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analysis are critical tools for understanding the role of protein dynamics and conformational changes in biological function. Despite the complexity of protein energy functions, normal modes provide a decoupled harmonic description of protein vibrations, making it possible to identify individual equilibrium vibrational motions that participate in ligand-binding. The proposed procedure for defining and comparing normal mode subspaces associated with ligand-binding could enable better understanding of protein-ligand interactions and aid in the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a pathogen that can survive in diverse host environments due to its metabolic flexibility in utilizing various carbon sources. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) is an essential enzyme for Mtb's glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and it differs from human FBA in its reaction mechanism, making it a potential drug target. To investigate the role of FBA in Mtb's acute and chronic infections and its in vitro essentiality, a study generated Mtb strains with regulated FBA expression using a tunable dual-control genetic switch. The study found that FBA is essential for Mtb's growth during acute and persistence during chronic mouse infections. However, its essentiality is carbon source-dependent, and Mtb can grow without FBA if two carbon sources enter metabolism above and below the FBA-catalyzed step. Complete inactivation of FBA by deletion of fba causes a failure to replicate with a single carbon source, while growth with two carbon sources is not affected. The presence of single carbon sources results in killing of the fba deletion strain, with varying kinetics depending on the specific carbon source. FBA-depleted Mtb fails to replicate in resting bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages and is cleared from mouse lungs by day 10 post-infection. Metabolism of single carbon sources by Δfba significantly alters intracellular metabolite concentrations, with a defect in glucose metabolism due to the absence of FBA activity. Growth of Δfba requires the presence of two carbon sources entering metabolism above and below the FBA-catalyzed reaction, and FBA facilitates the efficient catabolism of butyrate by driving glycolysis. Mtb is more sensitive to FBA depletion when grown with glucose as a sole carbon source than when metabolizing butyrate. This study's findings enhance our understanding of Mtb carbon metabolism and are relevant to tuberculosis drug development.
Two-cysteine peroxiredoxins are ubiquitous peroxidases that play various functions in cells, and they are particularly relevant in Leishmania and related trypanosomatids, which lack catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases. A specific enzyme of this family, the mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx), was investigated for its functional relevance along the Leishmania infantum life cycle. mTXNPx null mutants (mtxnpx−) were found to be unable to thrive in a murine model of infection, but this was not due to lack of peroxidase activity. Instead, the enzyme may function as a molecular chaperone, as suggested by its ability to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro and by the increased sensitivity of mtxnpx− to a temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C. These findings challenge the paradigm that all trypanosomatid 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrate that these 2-Cys peroxiredoxins can be determinant for pathogenicity independently of their peroxidase activity.
The Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) test, specifically the IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA, is a valuable tool for diagnosing progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) in HIV patients, especially in regions outside the United States where fungal cultures may not be readily available. In a multicenter, prospective study including two secondary and eight tertiary-care facilities in Mexico, the sensitivity of the ALPHA-HUAg was 67.1% (95% CI, 56-76.8%) and the specificity was 97.5% (95% CI, 94.3%-99.1%). However, the study found that the ALPHA-HUAg was inferior to the MVista-HUAg, which is the centralized test used in the United States. The study also found that a co-existing opportunistic infection was diagnosed in 10.5% of the PDH-proven patients, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Therefore, while the IMMY-HUAg may be useful for starting early antifungal treatment, a culture-based approach is necessary since co-infections are frequent and a negative IMMY-HUAg result does not rule out PDH. Histoplasmosis is a mycosis endemic to many parts of Latin America, including Mexico, and its clinical presentation varies depending on the host's immune status. In HIV-infected patients in advanced stages of the disease, it usually presents as PDH, which is fatal unless timely diagnosed and treated. The standard of reference for PDH diagnosis is the isolation of Histoplasma capsulatum from a non-respiratory sample or the visualization of yeast-like structures in the histopathologic examination. However, cultures may require up to six weeks of incubation and handling of H. capsulatum isolates requires advanced biosafety facilities, which are scarce in Latin America. Therefore, some have advocated that histoplasmosis is underreported in Latin America and since it is a neglected disease. In the United States, histoplasmosis is also endemic, and its PDH presentation is commonly diagnosed by the detection of Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg). This test, introduced in the late 80's, was performed until recently by a single central laboratory. However, in 2007, a new HUAg detection kit was released and approved for clinical use, which is commercially available for on-site use. This test, the IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA, has been considered inferior to the centralized test, but multicenter comparisons of these tests against fungal cultures and histopathology are lacking. For regions outside the United States, an on-site HUAg test is preferred for logistics, costs, and turn-around time of results. Therefore, this study aimed to prospectively and independently evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ALPHA-HUAg for the PDH diagnosis among HIV-infected patients in Mexico.
"Worldwide, approximately 1.8 million children die from diarrhea annually, with millions more suffering multiple episodes of nonfatal diarrhea. In up to 40% of cases, no etiologic agent can be identified. The advent of metagenomic sequencing has enabled the characterization of microbial populations, allowing for the detection of novel viruses in stool during episodes of acute diarrhea. A study used a ""micro-mass sequencing"" approach, which involves minimal starting sample quantity, minimal sample purification, and limited sequencing, to characterize the eukaryotic viral communities present in diarrhea specimens from 12 children. This methodology detected known enteric viruses as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with only limited sequence similarity to viruses in GenBank. The study also identified sequences from at least 9 putatively novel viruses, including two novel picobirnaviruses, a novel norovirus, and a novel astrovirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that many of the sequences were divergent from known sequences on the order that approximated a distinct subtype or genotype. The detection of these novel or unexpected viruses enables investigations to assess whether these agents play a causal role in human diarrhea."
The Dominican Republic has experienced significant outbreaks of dengue and Zika viruses, transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, causing widespread morbidity and mortality. A study was conducted using data from 2015-2016 to analyze the transmission dynamics, demographics, and reproductive number (R0) of these outbreaks. The study found that dengue cases were higher in males (54.5%) than females (45.5%), while Zika cases were more prevalent in females (73.8%) than males (26.2%). The R0 for Zika was 1.80 (95% CI 1.78, 1.82), with a higher R0 for females (1.84, 95% CI 1.82, 1.87) than males (1.72, 95% CI 1.69, 1.75). The study also found that Zika cases were more widely distributed among the population compared to dengue, which was mostly reported in those under 20 years old. Existing dengue immunity had little impact on Zika attack rates at the population level, and the accuracy of epidemiological metrics may be affected by sex-specific over-reporting. Community awareness campaigns and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Further research is needed to understand clinical Zika outcomes among dengue seropositive individuals. The study's findings can inform public health interventions and control strategies for Aedes-borne arboviruses in the Dominican Republic and similar settings.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, PARP2 rather than PARP1 plays a major role in DNA damage and immune responses, and PARG1 rather than PARG2 is the primary enzyme that counteracts poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation. PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in DNA damage repair and programmed cell death in animals, and in Arabidopsis, they have similar functions in microhomology mediated back-up non-homologous end joining and respond to ionizing radiation, dehydration, and excess cadmium. PARP inhibition in Arabidopsis enhances growth by promoting leaf cell number and makes plants more tolerant to a broad range of abiotic stresses. Arabidopsis PARP proteins make limited contributions to telomere regulation and maintenance, but telomere dysfunction triggers PARP activation. Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation is reversible and covalently attached poly (ADP-ribose) can be cleaved from acceptor proteins by PARG. Mammalian genomes encode a single PARG gene and mutation of PARG caused enhanced sensitivity to genotoxic stress and embryonic lethality in mice and Drosophila. Unlike animal models, the Arabidopsis genome encodes two PARG genes, PARG1 and PARG2, with 52% amino acid identity. PARG1 and PARG2, as well as an inactive pseudogene At2g31860, are all located adjacent to each other on Arabidopsis chromosome 2. PARG1 was originally identified to play a role in circadian oscillation in Arabidopsis, and the Arabidopsis PARG2 gene is robustly induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and numerous different pathogens, but disruption of PARG1, not PARG2, altered various plant defense responses. Arabidopsis PARG1 has also been implicated in drought, osmotic and oxidative stress responses. Despite the above work, the mechanisms by which PARPs and PARGs regulate diverse cellular processes in plants remain largely unknown.
The Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) proteins, including the C. elegans ortholog RPM-1, are intracellular signaling hubs that regulate synapse formation and axon termination. RPM-1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways. A new MAP kinase pathway has been identified, consisting of MIG-15 (MAP4K), NSY-1 (MAP3K), JKK-1 (MAP2K), and JNK-1, which suppress synapse formation defects but not axon termination defects in rpm-1 mutants. This pathway functions cell autonomously in mechanosensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals. Transgenic overexpression of kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway impairs synapse formation in wild-type animals. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling suppresses habituation defects in rpm-1 mutants, indicating the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway restricts glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning. Previous studies have shown that PHR proteins inhibit MAPK signaling by ubiquitinating MAP3Ks, and JNK signaling needs to be restricted for proper synapse formation. JNK signaling impacts the formation of neuron-neuron, central synapses in vivo, and altered JNK signaling has been linked to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease.
The nematodes C. elegans and C. briggsae share a sex-determination system where the master transcription factor TRA-1 controls sexual development. TRA-1 is a bipotential transcription factor, functioning as both an activator and a repressor, and its activity is regulated by interactions with other proteins and its own cleavage. The study of TRA-1 and its regulation is essential as it controls the sperm/oocyte decision and has been conserved in nematodes. A subset of transcription factors like Gli2 and Oct1 are bipotential, and recent studies have shown that TRA-1 might also be bipotential. The C. briggsae TRR-1 gene, a homolog of mammalian TRRAP, is required for spermatogenesis and works with TRA-1 as a co-activator to promote the expression of genes like fog-3. The relative importance of TRR-1 and TRA-1 has changed dramatically during recent evolution, with C. briggsae trr-1 null mutants preventing hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, and C. elegans fem null mutants preventing spermatogenesis. The relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can shift rapidly during evolution, producing the same phenotype by alternative, complementary mechanisms. This study highlights the importance of comparative evolutionary studies in understanding conserved aspects of gene regulation.
Researchers have developed new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the extent of information generated by a system as it transitions between states, overcoming limitations of previous measures that were defined only for discrete Markov systems. These new measures can be applied to time-series data and are demonstrated to be effective through simulations. The findings have implications for understanding consciousness and other neurocognitive processes, but also pose challenges for theories that ascribe physical meaning to the measured quantities. The researchers also highlight the importance of measuring dynamical complexity in networks of interconnected elements, such as neural systems, and the potential for dynamical complexity to account for fundamental aspects of consciousness. The study of integrated information, a measure of the amount of information that is integrated by a system, is also discussed, with new versions of this measure being both theoretically well-grounded and practically applicable given time-series data. These new measures have the potential to shed light on many complex systems, both biological and non-biological, and to formulate testable hypotheses and synthetic models relating information integration to cognitive and neural operations.
In recent years, there has been a widespread transmission of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda, raising concerns about a potential overlap with the Gambian form of the disease. A recent study used logistic regression methods to explore the relationship between the prevalence of Rhodesian HAT and several social, environmental, and climatic variables in two of the most recently affected districts of Uganda. The study found that the disease had spread into the study area due to the movement of infected, untreated livestock. This research was extended to account for spatial autocorrelation, incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters and undertake predictive mapping for risk of high HAT prevalence in future.The study used a spatial analysis in which a generalized linear geostatistical model was used in a Bayesian framework to account explicitly for spatial autocorrelation and incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters. The results strongly support the theory that Rhodesian HAT was imported to the study area via the movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. The analysis also confirmed the confounding effect of health care accessibility on the spatial distribution of Rhodesian HAT and the linkages between the disease's distribution and minimum land surface temperature. Predictive mapping indicates an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in the future in areas surrounding livestock markets, demonstrating the importance of livestock trading for continuing disease spread.Rhodesian HAT and Gambian HAT are caused by different parasites, and the most effective control options, diagnostic procedures, and treatment regimes differ for the two forms of the disease. Currently, treatment is implemented based on knowledge of the areas affected by each type of HAT, and a definitive diagnostic differentiation between the two parasite subtypes is difficult and requires expensive, complex methods. Consequently, spatial concurrence of the two forms of HAT would compromise diagnostic and treatment protocols, resulting in a higher proportion of treatment failures and placing increased pressure on an already stretched health system.A comprehensive understanding of the social, environmental, and climatic aspects involved in the spatial distribution and spread of Rhodesian HAT is vital to enable the targeting of disease control activities. The interaction of factors influencing the long-distance spread of Rhodesian HAT, such as livestock trading networks, with the environmental and climatic factors controlling the spatial distribution of the disease in affected areas, is not well understood. Such knowledge could provide significant evidence for targeted control measures to prevent the further spread and establishment of the disease.
The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems has been challenged, leading to the discovery that the existence of a feasible equilibrium, assumed in local stability criteria, is not guaranteed in species-rich systems. This is true even when weak interactions are present in ecologically-inspired systems. The dynamical behavior of ecologically inspired architectures is richer than that of unstructured systems. A fundamental question in ecology is understanding the factors and conditions that ensure ecological systems persist, a requisite for the sustained provisioning of vital ecosystem services. Early ideas suggested that complex natural systems are more likely to be stable, but later it was shown that large random systems may be expected to be stable up to a certain connectance threshold, contradicting the earlier ideas. More recent work has established stability criteria for systems where species interact specifically via competition, mutualism, or predation. The general conclusion is that, in species-rich communities, interactions should be moderate to ensure the stability of the equilibrium. Simulations show that such ecologically-inspired structured graphs are less stable than unstructured ones. All these approaches are local-stability analyses, assuming the equilibrium is feasible. However, a true Jacobian, evaluated at the equilibrium, was replaced by a random matrix in previous works. The feasibility of the equilibria was not tested in May's work, and it was found that stability increased with the number of species in feasible systems. Equilibrium-abundances must be strictly positive for a stable equilibrium to be meaningful. A recent study has explored the question of feasibility, showing that keeping the fraction well-defined when the number of species increases requires that the absolute mean interaction strength is small enough. In this work, we present an extensive study of the fundamental question of equilibrium feasibility and investigate how complexity influences feasibility probability. We find that, in situations compatible with previous works, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is not guaranteed, and with weak interactions, non-trivial feasible equilibria are found only in ecologically-inspired systems in a way that is ecologically sensible.
Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium that causes Q fever, is a widespread intracellular pathogen with a near-global distribution, although there are significant gaps in the understanding of its prevalence, spatial distribution, and risk factors in Africa. A recent systematic review highlighted these gaps, focusing on parts of Western and Nyanza Provinces in Western Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the One Health epidemiology of Q fever in cattle and humans in the region. Serum samples from 2049 humans and 955 cattle were analyzed for C. burnetii antibodies, and questionnaires covering demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information were administered. These data were linked to environmental datasets based on geographical locations.The overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle. However, there was no evidence of correlation between cattle and human seroprevalence within households or when incorporating spatial proximity to other households. Multilevel modeling indicated the importance of several factors for exposure to the organism. Cattle obtained from markets (as opposed to those bred in their homestead) and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels had the highest seroprevalence. For humans, the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, and there were variations between ethnic groups. Frequent livestock contact, specifically grazing and dealing with abortion material, was also a risk factor.These results illustrate endemicity of C. burnetii in western Kenya, although prevalence is relatively low. Environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns, while human exposure patterns are likely to be driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The implication of livestock markets in cattle exposure risks suggests these may be a suitable target for interventions.
Schistosomiasis, a tropical disease caused by parasitic flatworms, affects millions of people worldwide. The genome sequences of the three major schistosome species have been determined, necessitating the development of functional genomic approaches to understand the role and importance of these genes. Transgenesis is an established approach for functional genomics, which can lead to gain-or-loss-of-functions, facilitate vector-based RNA interference, and represent a powerful forward genetics tool for insertional mutagenesis screens. However, routinely introducing transgenes into schistosomes is challenging due to the lack of reliable germ cell localization. A potential solution is to transduce the egg, a critical developmental stage in the schistosome life cycle. To monitor transgene integration into schistosome germ cells, vasa, an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase, was identified as a germ cell marker. Three vasa-like genes, Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3, were identified in S. mansoni, showing high identity to Vasa proteins from other flukes. These genes exhibited germ cell-specific expression in the posterior ovary, where oocytes mature. These findings suggest that reporter transgenes driven by a vasa promoter might be useful for monitoring transgene integration into schistosome germ cells. Overall, these results contribute to the development of functional genomic approaches for studying schistosome genes, which could lead to the identification of novel targets for anti-schistosomal interventions.
Heart valve disease is a major global health issue, and understanding the mechanisms of cardiac valve development and homeostasis is essential. Hippo signaling is crucial for organ development and tissue homeostasis, but its role in valve formation and maintenance is unclear. A study found that VGLL4, a transcription cofactor, is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-EMT stage and is required for normal valve development by antagonizing YAP activity. Tissue-specific knockout of VGLL4 in different cell lineages revealed that only endothelial loss of VGLL4 led to valve malformation. Manipulation of Hippo components could be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital valve disease. The Hippo pathway regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, stem cell fate determination, and organ size in multiple organs and tissues. VGLL4, a member of the Vestigial-like family, is a transcription cofactor that competes with YAP for TEADs binding, resulting in the inhibition of YAP-induced overgrowth and tumor genesis. VGLL4 is the only member of the VGLL family expressed in the heart, and its role in heart valve development and homeostasis has remained unknown. A VGLL4 reporter mouse line was constructed to investigate the VGLL4 expression pattern and found that the expression of VGLL4 increased dramatically in endothelial and interstitial cells in the valve region at the post-EMT stage and was maintained till the adult stage. Endothelial specific and neural crest specific Cre mice were used to knock out VGLL4 in different cell lineages that contribute to valve interstitial cells. The results showed that only endothelial loss of VGLL4 led to valve malformation, and semi-knockout of YAP rescued the phenotype of arterial valves in VGLL4 deleted heart, indicating that VGLL4 was required for normal valve development by antagonizing YAP activity. Therefore, VGLL4 plays a key role in valve development and maintenance.
A debate exists in the scientific community regarding the prevalence and identifiability of soft selective sweeps in natural population data. Some studies argue that soft sweeps are pervasive across organisms, while others claim they are rare. This discrepancy can be attributed to opposing results from different studies and the relevance and identifiability of these models in natural populations. Recent research has highlighted issues with the underlying methodologies of these studies, including high false-positive rates and the oversight of well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps. These findings emphasize the importance of proper demographic null models, best practices, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the role of positive selection in shaping genetic variation. Despite the enthusiasm for invoking soft sweeps, it remains unclear whether they are a common occurrence or a rare exception. Therefore, it is crucial to critically evaluate new methodologies and claims regarding the prevalence and identifiability of soft selective sweeps.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vectors for dengue fever, causing 50-100 million infections in humans per year. Female mosquitoes transmit the disease through blood-feeding, and their host-seeking behavior is inhibited for three days following a blood meal by a hemolymph-borne humoral factor. Head Peptide-I is a candidate peptide mediating this suppression, showing sequence similarity to short Neuropeptide-F peptides that signal through Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptors (NPYLRs). Eight NPYLRs were identified in the Ae. aegypti genome and screened in a cell-based calcium imaging assay for sensitivity against a panel of peptides. NPYLR1 responded to Head Peptide-I as well as sNPFs, and two NPYLR1 homologues were also sensitive to Head Peptide-I in the genome of the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis. However, npylr1 mutants displayed normal behavior in locomotion, egg laying, sugar feeding, blood feeding, host seeking, and inhibition of host seeking after a blood meal, indicating that other receptors, additional peptides, or both regulate this important behavior. These findings suggest that the inhibition of host-seeking behavior in mosquitoes is a complex process involving multiple signaling pathways. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this behavior and to develop effective strategies for combating the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that is prevalent in Nigeria and globally, with Nigeria having the highest number of cases in the world. The disease is caused by Schistosoma parasites and is transmitted through contact with freshwater containing cercariae, the parasite's larval stage. The transmission and distribution of schistosomiasis are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, elevation, slope, land use/land cover, and proximity to water bodies. A study was conducted in Akure North Local Government Area (LGA) of Ondo State, Nigeria, to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission using remote sensing and spatial analysis.The study focused on temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/land cover as the factors controlling schistosomiasis incidence in the study area. The researchers used multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Saaty’s analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to obtain the mapping weight or importance of each individual schistosomiasis risk factor. The results showed that a larger portion of the area (82%) fell under the high and very high-risk category, and the predictions made by the model correlated strongly with observations from field studies.Schistosomiasis is a significant public health problem in Nigeria, with S. haematobium being the predominant species. The parasite's life cycle involves a freshwater snail host, and the distribution and abundance of these snails drive the links between transmission and environment/climate. Therefore, temperature, rainfall, proximity to water bodies, and other environmental factors may be possible factors for risk area determination. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) can be used to study the transmission dynamics of the disease and promote prevention and control towards sustainenace of a healthy environment.In conclusion, schistosomiasis is a widespread and neglected tropical disease in Nigeria, with environmental factors playing a significant role in its transmission and distribution. Remote sensing and GIS can be useful tools in identifying and predicting the transmission of schistosomiasis and monitoring disease risk in newly established rural and agricultural communities.
Pneumococcal meningitis, a common bacterial infection of the brain, is associated with significant long-term disabilities and is largely dependent on the presence of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin (PLY) for its neuropathogenic potential. PLY is critical for the clinical course of experimental pneumococcal meningitis and is persistent in the cerebrospinal fluid, correlating with a poorer prognosis in human patients. A study of human frontal neocortical brain samples obtained from autopsy cases following death from S. pneumoniae meningitis and from control cases found that S. pneumoniae meningitis induced a reduction in synaptic density that was independent of cell death, specifically in the superficial neocortical layers I-II. Further experiments using the PLY-producing S. pneumoniae strain D39 and PLY-deficient mutants confirmed that PLY deficiency strongly diminished synaptic loss in mouse pneumococcal meningitis without an increase in cell death. Exposure of acute mouse brain slices to PLY at disease-relevant, non-lytic concentrations caused permanent dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination, and synaptic loss, due to increased glutamate levels within the mouse brain slices. This glutamate-dependent synaptic damage is mediated by PLY initiating glutamate release from astrocytes. These findings demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of synaptic pathology in pneumococcal meningitis and outline a significant synapto- and dendritotoxic role for PLY in the disease through its ability to initiate glutamate release from astrocytes.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with major human cancers, and there is interest in developing vaccines and microbicides to prevent HPV infections. The infectious life cycle of HPVs is closely linked to the differentiation state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus only made in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment. It has been hypothesized that this specificity may be due to the expression of entry receptors, but this could not fully explain the differentiation restriction of HPV infection. A study using chemical biology approaches found that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. G1-synchronized human keratinocytes as hosts and early viral gene expression as a readout for infection showed that the recipient cell must enter M phase for HPV infection to take place. This finding provides one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia, as only this compartment of the epithelium contains cells progressing through the cell cycle. By defining a major condition for cell susceptibility to HPV infection, these results have potentially important implications for HPV control.
Penicillium marneffei is the most common thermal dimorphic fungus causing systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia, and it has been recently renamed as Talaromyces marneffei. This fungus has a distinct cellular morphology in different temperatures, with hyphae in mycelial phase at 25°C and yeast cells in yeast phase at 37°C. The signals that trigger the switch in response to temperature and signaling pathways leading to the transition are largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants. Recently, miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) have been identified in several fungi, including the thermal dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei. In Penicillium marneffei, 24 potential milRNA candidates have been identified, which were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Two genes encoding putative Dicer-like proteins (dcl-1 and dcl-2) and a gene encoding a putative Argonaute-like protein (qde-2) have been identified in Penicillium marneffei. Northern blot analysis confirmed the differential expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, in mycelial phase, which was dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. These findings provide evidence for the existence of milRNAs in thermal dimorphic fungi and differential expression of milRNAs during different growth phases, which may provide new insights into the mechanism governing thermal dimorphism.
The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus and is transmitted to humans by infected Aedes mosquitoes. Although ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda in 1947, the first human outbreak occurred in Yap state in Federated States of Micronesia in 2007. ZIKV reemerged in the Pacific region in 2013 in French Polynesia and spread across the region and to the Americas between 2014 and 2016. This outbreak was associated with neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and microcephaly. Phylogenetic studies indicate that ZIKV is divided into two lineages: African and Asian, with less than 12% of genetic divergence. The 2013-2016 outbreak was due to the emergence of ZIKV belonging to the Asian lineage, and genetic analysis revealed divergence between the Pacific and the American clades.In a study conducted to analyze the ability of Pacific vectors to transmit ZIKV, wild Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands were collected and exposed to a ZIKV strain that circulated in the region during the 2013-2017 outbreak. The study found that ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between the Ae. aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogenous between these populations. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. The results indicated a low ZIKV transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis tested from the Pacific region. These results were unexpected and suggest the importance of other factors such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, or the large immunologically naive fraction of the population that may have contributed to the rapid spread of the ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013-2017 outbreak.In summary, ZIKV is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus and is transmitted to humans by infected Aedes mosquitoes.

The lncRNA Xist is a major regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells, and its function is dependent on stable secondary and higher-order structures. To study the structure of Xist in cells, researchers developed Targeted Structure-Seq, which combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing, enriching for signals from the RNA of interest and providing a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. This method was used to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA, resulting in new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5’-end of Xist and a new evolutionarily conserved element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function. Xist has at least two main functions, silencing of transcription and spreading on the X chromosome, which map to different features within the RNA, and its most notable feature is a set of diverse regions that include distinct repeat sequences. While certain functional elements have been uncovered, the regions of Xist required for spreading and recruitment of other protein factors are still poorly defined, and understanding the cellular functions of RNA features within Xist would be greatly assisted by knowing their in vivo conformations. RNA elements can fold into thermodynamically stable structures to fulfill their regulatory roles, and building accurate models of the conformations of elements within Xist would be facilitated by experimental data that discriminate paired and unpaired bases in an RNA molecule. Prior to this study, no approach existed that allowed targeted analysis of the conformation of large RNAs such as Xist in mammalian cells, but recent advances in RNA structural probing have paved the way for such a technique.
Genetic risk prediction models for complex diseases have identified an increasing number of genetic variants, but the clinical utility of these models remains controversial. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) has been the primary measure for assessing the predictive value of genetic tests, but it has limitations and should be complemented by other measures. This study presents a novel unifying statistical framework that connects a wide range of predictive indices, allowing for the estimation of various prediction metrics such as AUC, mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. The framework is based on the liability threshold model, which assumes an underlying liability that is normally distributed. Given the overall disease probability and the level of variance in total liability explained by the genetic variants, this framework provides a comprehensive evaluation of risk models for complex diseases. The study demonstrates the applicability of this framework by evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for nine complex diseases. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for assessing the clinical utility of genetic risk prediction models, which is essential for the successful implementation of personalized medicine.
The study compares the diagnostic accuracy of a new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, which uses recombinant antigens, with an existing RDT produced using native antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT) and the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT). The study was conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 57,632 individuals screened either passively at health centers or actively by mobile teams. A total of 260 HAT cases were confirmed by parasitology. The highest sensitivity was achieved with the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 (71.2%), followed by CATT (62.5%) and the SD BIOLINE HAT (59.0%). The most specific test was CATT (99.2%), while the specificity of the SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 were 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively. Sensitivity of the tests was lower than previously reported, as they identified cases from partially overlapping sub-populations. All three tests were significantly more sensitive in passive than in active screening. Combining two or three tests resulted in a markedly increased sensitivity: When the SD BIOLINE HAT was combined with the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, sensitivity reached 98.4% in passive and 83.0% in active screening. The recombinant antigen-based RDT was more sensitive than, and as specific as, the SD BIOLINE HAT. It was as sensitive as, but slightly less specific than CATT. While the practicality and cost-effectiveness of algorithms including several screening tests would need to be investigated, using two or more tests appears to enhance sensitivity of diagnostic algorithms, although some decrease in specificity is observed.
Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease affecting millions in Latin America, has been controlled in Guatemala through indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS), although some foci of Triatoma dimidiata infestation persist. A study in the municipality of Comapa, Jutiapa, Guatemala, showed that after multiple rounds of IRS and intermittent focal spraying (2003-2012), the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% (2001-2) to 27% (2011). However, household construction materials alone predicted less than 10% of infested houses. Chagas seroprevalence in Comapa declined in school-aged children by 10-fold, from 10% (1999) to 1% (2015), but remained >10% in women of childbearing age. Despite significantly reduced transmission, the continued risk for vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. Systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are needed to reach the elimination goal in regions with persistent vector infestation. Chagas disease is a significant global health security threat, with over 8 million people infected, causing more than 10,000 annual deaths and over 528,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Latin America alone. It is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, congenital transmission, oral ingestion, and vector-borne transmission, the most common route in endemic areas. Vector control efforts have focused on eliminating triatomine vectors from the domicile through IRS. IRS has been successful in reducing domestic infestations to ≤1% in 17 countries and eliminating the presence of the main vectors from entire regions.
Citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, is widely used to model the route of pathogenesis in human A/E pathogens like enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The genome of C. rodentium is unstable, as shown by large-scale genome recombination and active transposition of mobile genetic elements such as prophages. The genome of C. rodentium is representative of the species, and most of the inactivating mutations were common to both isolates and likely occurred early on in the evolution of this pathogen. These findings suggest that C. rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen that may have emerged alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. The genomes of enteric bacteria, including C. rodentium, are dynamic entities that can undergo gene acquisition and loss through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) and gene deletions, rearrangements, and point mutations. These genome fluxes can have a profound effect on the organism and may eventually define different isolates, pathotypes, or even species. Genome fluxes in C. rodentium are associated with adaptation to different niches and have been linked to host adaptation in Salmonella Typhi and Yersinia pestis.
The authors propose a method to infer the molecular mechanisms that shape protein distribution using stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. They derive analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution and demonstrate that these moments capture the shape of protein distributions. An algorithm is developed to infer gene expression rate constants from protein distribution moments. The authors find that, despite degeneracy in rate constants, the solution space almost always informs about the underlying mechanism, such as distinguishing between regimes of transcriptional bursting and constitutive transcript production. The method agrees with current approaches and obtains rate constants not previously accessible. This framework provides a powerful tool for deducing the contributions of particular molecular mechanisms to specific patterns of gene expression.Stochasticity in transcription and translation produces fluctuations in RNA and protein, leading to a distribution of RNA and protein counts across cells. Learning the mechanistic details of a gene's expression requires measuring cell-to-cell expression variability, simulating this variability, and fitting the model parameters from experimental data. While methods exist for tasks 1 and 2, task 3, fitting the model of stochastic gene expression to protein distributions, has no general solution. Existing approaches are often inefficient, make assumptions about gene expression, or do not account for the expected degeneracy of CDRCs producing a given protein distribution.This work aims to address how much information is contained in protein distributions. The authors present an assumption-free solution to the steady-state protein distribution using analytical solutions to the first four moments of the protein distribution and an efficient, exhaustive fitting algorithm that returns ensembles of CDRC sets that map to a particular set of moments. The authors show that solution set ensembles are always informative, providing mechanistic information about gene behavior, such as distinguishing between genes undergoing transcription bursts from those that transcribe constitutively.In summary, the authors propose a robust, efficient, and assumption-free approach for inferring the molecular mechanisms that underlie protein distribution shapes. By solving protein distribution moments, the method accurately estimates rate constants, identifies underlying mechanisms, and informs about the contributions of molecular mechanisms to gene expression patterns.
Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a significant public health concern due to its similarity to variola virus, the cause of smallpox, and its increasing occurrence in Africa. MPXV can infect various animal species and causes a disease similar to smallpox in humans, characterized by a rash and lymphadenopathy. The virus is endemic in Central and West Africa and can be transmitted from animals to humans, with the potential for human-to-human transmission. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for MPX, and control efforts rely on preventing zoonotic exposure and interrupting person-to-person spread. A new study explores a vaccination strategy using recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors expressing different MPXV glycoproteins. The study found that a vaccine using BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106 alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK provided protection for STAT1 (−/−) mice against MPXV challenge. This work demonstrates the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and their potential for developing a vaccine against MPXV.
In many eukaryotes, including trypanosomes, the major mRNA decay pathway is the 5’-3’ decay pathway. After deadenylation, mRNAs are decapped by the nudix hydrolase DCP2 of the decapping complex and then degraded by the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease. However, trypanosomes lack homologues to all subunits of the decapping complex, while deadenylation and 5’-3’ degradation are conserved. A study found that trypanosomes use an ApaH-like phosphatase (ALPH1) as their major mRNA decapping enzyme. ALPH1 is a novel trypanosome stress granule protein and is involved in mRNA binding. A fraction of ALPH1 co-localises exclusively with the trypanosome 5’-3’ exoribonuclease XRNA to a special granule at the posterior pole of the cell, indicating a connection between the two enzymes. RNAi depletion of ALPH1 is lethal and causes a massive increase in total mRNAs that are deadenylated but have not yet started 5’-3’ decay. In vitro experiments show that recombinant, N-terminally truncated ALHP1 protein, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, sensitises the capped trypanosome spliced leader RNA to yeast Xrn1, but only if an RNA 5’ polyphosphatase is included. This indicates that the decapping mechanism of ALPH1 differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2 by leaving more than one phosphate group at the mRNA’s 5’ end. This is the first reported function of a eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class of enzymes present in all phylogenetic super-groups of the eukaryotic kingdom. The substrates of eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatases are unknown, but the substrate of the related bacterial enzyme ApaH, diadenosine tetraphosphate, is highly reminiscent of a eukaryotic mRNA cap.
A recent study has demonstrated the regenerative potential of pancreatic new-born glucagon-producing cells. Through the ectopic expression of a single gene, Pax4, it was shown that these cells can convert into insulin-producing β-like cells. Further research has revealed that the selective inhibition of the Arx gene in α-cells is sufficient to promote the conversion of adult α-cells into β-like cells at any age. This conversion induces a continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, resulting in the generation of glucagon+ cells, which are subsequently converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. The loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion. The mature pancreas is organized into two main compartments: the exocrine pancreas and the endocrine compartment. The exocrine pancreas is involved in the production of digestive enzymes, while the endocrine compartment consists of highly vascularized functional units called islets of Langerhans. These islets contain five distinct cell subtypes, responsible for the production of the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is caused by an autoimmune reaction leading to the loss of insulin-producing β-cells, resulting in chronic hyperglycemia. The misexpression of Arx in adult β-cells induces their conversion into cells exhibiting α- or PP-cell characteristics, while the ectopic expression of Pax4 in glucagon-expressing cells converts these cells into β-like cells, which can counteract the effects of chemically-induced hyperglycemia. In an effort to harness this regenerative potential, researchers generated transgenic models allowing the constitutive or conditional inactivation of Arx in glucagon-expressing cells. The resulting data suggest that the inhibition of Arx expression in α-cells could induce their conversion into β-like cells and regenerate a functional β-cell mass, thereby reversing diabetes.
Eukaryotic cells must prevent re-replication of their DNA to maintain genome stability, as re-replication can lead to genomic alterations. This is accomplished by preventing the reassembly of replication initiation complexes at origins that have fired. In eukaryotic cells, the core replicative helicase Mcm2-7 is loaded onto origin DNA to form a toroidal complex, and this loading is regulated by various factors including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and Mcm2-7. Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) use multiple mechanisms to prevent the reloading of Mcm2-7 once cells enter S phase. In addition to these CDK-dependent mechanisms, CDK-independent mechanisms also inhibit Cdt1. While the precise mechanisms used vary among species, the reliance on multiple mechanisms targeting each of the initiation proteins involved in Mcm2-7 loading is highly conserved. However, recent studies have challenged the assumption that all replication origins are uniformly regulated by global inhibition mechanisms. Origins re-initiate with diverse efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled, and this diversity cannot be explained by differences in the efficiency or timing of origin initiation during normal S phase replication. This observation suggests an additional layer of replication control that can differentially regulate re-initiation at distinct origins. Novel genetic elements, referred to as re-initiation promoters (RIPs), have been identified that are necessary for preferential re-initiation of certain origins and sufficient to confer preferential re-initiation on heterologous origins when the control of re-initiation is partially deregulated. These RIPs do not enhance the S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins, and map to ∼60 bp AT rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. These findings indicate a local level of control in the block to re-initiation, which creates a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential that is revealed when global mechanisms preventing re-replication are compromised. This has implications for our understanding of the role of re-replication in genomic alterations, as some regions of the genome may be more susceptible to these alterations than others.
Invasive amebiasis (IA) caused by Entamoeba histolytica is a significant global health problem, with 40,000 to 100,000 deaths annually. IA is transmitted through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the cyst form of E. histolytica, which is prevalent in developing countries in Central and South America, Asia, and Africa. However, in developed countries, most cases occur in travelers and immigrants from endemic areas. Recently, there has been an increase in the risk of amebiasis among men who have sex with men (MSM) in East Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea due to oral-anal sexual contact. The annual incidence of HIV-1 infection is also increasing among MSM in these countries, leading to growing concern about IA in HIV-1-infected MSM.A study was conducted to analyze the medical records of 170 HIV-1-infected Japanese patients with IA and genotype E. histolytica in 14 of these patients. The study found that the clinical presentation of IA in HIV-1-infected patients was similar to that described in normal hosts. High fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP were associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Two cases died from amebic colitis, and three cases died from causes unrelated to amebiasis. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in the other 165 cases. However, luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment did not reduce recurrence of amebiasis in high-risk populations, probably due to amebic re-infection.The outcome of metronidazole and tinidazole treatment of uncomplicated amebiasis was excellent, even in HIV-1-infected individuals. Luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment does not reduce recurrence of amebiasis in high-risk populations, probably due to amebic re-infection. The spread of E. histolytica in MSM of other developed countries beyond Asia should be of great concern. Therefore, educational approaches to prevent new amebic infections are crucial in preventing IA recurrence, especially in high-risk groups such as HIV-1-infected MSM.
In the Mandoul focus of Southern Chad, a persistent area of Gambian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness, around 100 cases were diagnosed annually until 2
Imported Strongyloidiasis in Spain: Epidemiological, Clinical, and Microbiological CharacteristicsIn a study of 1245 patients with imported Strongyloidiasis in Spain, most were immigrants (66.9%) from South America, where the parasite is endemic. The majority were asymptomatic, but 82.2% had eosinophilia, and 6.4% had immunosuppressant conditions. Almost half (48.6%) had another infectious disease, with Chagas disease being the most prevalent (21.8%). Serology was the primary diagnostic tool, allowing diagnosis in 78.1% of cases. Treatment with ivermectin was associated with better outcomes. Although 82.2% of patients had eosinophilia, it may have been due to other causes, as some were co-infected with other helminthiases. Immigrants and VFR-immigrants accounted for most cases, but travelers represented 6% of the total study population. The presence of eosinophilia, male gender, and definite diagnosis were associated with achieving the cure criteria, while treatment with ivermectin increased the likelihood of cure.
Vaccination is a crucial method to protect against infectious diseases, and determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important consideration in vaccine design. Higher inoculum doses generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. A study illustrates this concept by fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. The model is used to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. The study finds that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, this framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum. Overall, the development of a better vaccine that remains protective in the presence of antigenic drift and that has a higher efficacy remains a priority. The study of the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity is an important step towards better vaccine design.
The cyanobacterium Anabaena undergoes a developmental process under nitrogen deprivation, resulting in a one-dimensional pattern of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts separated by photosynthetic vegetative cells. A study was conducted to analyze the fluctuations of gene expression of HetR, a transcription factor essential for heterocyst differentiation, under steady-state growth in nitrogen-rich conditions and at different times following nitrogen deprivation. Statistical analysis of fluorescence at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments demonstrates that expression fluctuations of hetR in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic spatial range of circa two to three cells. This sets the scale for cellular interactions along a filament. Fluctuations after nitrogen step-down can build on those under nitrogen-replete conditions. Basal, steady-state expression of the HetR inhibitor PatS, cell-cell communication influenced by the septal protein SepJ, and positive HetR auto-regulation are essential determinants of fluctuations in hetR expression and its distribution along filaments. Proteins involved in activation, inhibition, and cell-cell communication combine together in the presence of inevitable stochasticity in gene expression to control the coupled fluctuations of gene expression that give rise to a one-dimensional developmental pattern in this organism. This development is crucial for the organism to adapt to changing nitrogen levels.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype shift from genotype III (GIII) to genotype I (GI) has occurred in China, as demonstrated by molecular epidemiological surveillance and a serological survey in JEV-non-vaccinated pigs. The survey confirmed JEV genotype shift at the sero-epidemiological level with an average GI/GIII infection ratio of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of GI and GIII infections with GI infection being more prevalent in pigs in China. To understand the reasons for this JEV genotype shift, the replication kinetics of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI strains and four GIII strains, were compared in mosquito C6/36 cells, chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC). GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in DF-1 and PIEC cells, particularly in DF-1 cells, with titers reaching 22.9-225.3 fold higher than GIII strains. These results suggest enhanced replication efficiency of GI viruses in avian cells. In vivo experiments using young domestic ducklings as the animal model confirmed this hypothesis, with GI-inoculated ducklings developing higher viremia titers and a comparatively longer viremic duration than GIII-inoculated ducklings. These findings indicate that the enhanced replication of GI strains in birds may have resulted in higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, leading to an increased transmission efficiency in the birds-mosquitoes-birds enzootic transmission cycle, contributing to JEV genotype shift.
The pathogenicity of the fungal commensal Candida albicans is attributed to its ability to form biofilms, which is regulated by a network of transcription factors (TFs) including Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt8
Asparagine (Asn) metabolism has recently gained interest in the fields of cancer and infection, with asparagine synthetase (AS) being a key player. AS converts aspartate into Asn in an ATP-dependent manner, using ammonia or glutamine as nitrogen sources. AS-A, found in trypanosomatids and absent in humans, is of particular interest as it is essential for the survival of Leishmania donovani. However, a study investigated the role of Leishmania infantum AS-A (LiAS-A) and found that, while LiAS-A can use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen donors, LiAS-A null mutants do not display any significant growth or infectivity defects. The null mutants only showed a severe impairment of in vitro growth under asparagine limiting conditions. Therefore, AS-A is not a suitable drug target against L. infantum parasites. Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease, is caused by several species of Leishmania and can present as self-healing cutaneous manifestations or fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL is mainly associated with L. donovani or L. infantum, and control relies on chemotherapy and vector control. However, traditional therapeutic options are associated with significant limitations, and between 20,000 and 30,000 people, mostly children, die from VL every year. Therefore, there is a need for novel chemotherapeutic options.
A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy. The study search produced 204 publications, of which 11 case-control studies were included. These studies were carried out in 13 countries and involved a total of 4740 subjects. The pooled odds ratio for the association between epilepsy and Toxocara spp. seropositivity was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42--2.01). The study found a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy, particularly in studies using Western Blot as a diagnostic test, studies including younger populations, and population-based studies. Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection caused by Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati, the common roundworms of dogs and cats. Humans become infected through direct contact with dogs or by ingesting contaminated food or soil. Ingested eggs develop into juvenile larvae that migrate to various organs, causing a multisystemic inflammatory tissue reaction. Soil contamination with Toxocara spp. eggs is a significant source of transmission to humans, and the prevalence of soil contamination varies between studies. Infection can also occur through the accidental ingestion of embryonated eggs from contaminated water, vegetables, fruit, raw or undercooked meat or organs from paratenic hosts, or through contact with dogs and cats contaminated with Toxocara spp. eggs. The clinical spectrum of toxocariasis in humans varies from asymptomatic infection to severe organ injury, including neurotoxocariasis, which can lead to neurological manifestations ranging from meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis to cerebral vasculitis.
The study describes a new ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA (miRNA) that plays a critical role in cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The pathway involves IR-induced DSBs activating ATM, leading to the downregulation of miR-335, which targets CtIP, an important trigger of DNA end resection in homologous recombination repair (HRR). CREB is responsible for a large portion of miR-335 expression, and its binding to the promoter region of miR-335 is reduced after IR. Overexpression of miR-335 in HeLa cells results in reduced CtIP levels and post-IR colony survival and BRCA1 foci formation. In two patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with decreased post-IR colony survival, elevated miR-335 expression, reduced CtIP levels, and reduced BRCA1 foci formation are observed, which are partially rescued by miRNA antisense AMO-miR-335 treatment. These findings suggest that an ATM-dependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis influences the selection of HRR for repair of certain DSB lesions. Overall, the study highlights the importance of miRNAs in the DNA damage response and their potential as targets for cancer therapy.
"This study investigates how interpreting others' behavior through mentalizing, or the attribution of mental states, influences learning in social contexts. The research shows that sophisticated recursive beliefs, as in ""I think that you think that I think..."", are critical to learning in social interactions. Participants played repeated games against artificial mentalizing agents with different sophistication levels, and results showed that participants won against artificial (sophisticated) mentalizing agents in the social framing of the task, and lost in the non-social framing. Furthermore, participants' choice sequences were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social framing. These findings suggest that mentalizing aids learning in social contexts and that intentionally deciphering behavior is not possible without attributing mental states to others. This study highlights the crucial role of mentalizing in social cognition and its importance in decision-making and learning."
The study discusses the use of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) for inferring interaction networks in biological systems, which can provide additional information for analyzing human diseases beyond traditional methods. However, existing approaches for GGM inference can be statistically inconsistent or inefficient for large-scale, high-dimensional data. The study proposes an efficient algorithm for GGM inference using a method by Ren et al. (2015), which provides p-values and confidence intervals for each edge in the graph. The algorithm is shown to be faster than the existing implementation without sacrificing accuracy. The algorithm is applied to transcriptomic data from a study of childhood asthma and proteomic data from a study of Alzheimer’s disease, resulting in the estimation of global gene or protein interaction networks for the disease and healthy samples. The networks reveal interesting interactions and the differential networks between cases and controls show functional relevance to the diseases. The study provides a computationally fast algorithm for constructing GGM and making inference with high-dimensional biological data, implemented in the R package “FastGGM.” This allows for the analysis of large-scale biological networks, which can help elucidate complex biological processes and diseases.
The striatum, the main input structure of the basal ganglia, is crucial for the learning and execution of movement sequences. Its main components, medium spiny neurons (MSNs), form cell assemblies with coherently varying firing rates on slow behaviorally relevant timescales. A model of a local MSN network shows that at realistic connectivities and with realistically sized inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs), MSN network-generated population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical driving activity. The model suggests that the local MSN network has optimal characteristics, allowing it to generate stimulus-dependent activity patterns for long periods after variations in cortical excitation, without being too stable or too unstable. This optimal responsiveness enables the striatum to effectively transmit relevant cortical inputs downstream in the basal ganglia while suppressing others. MSN network connectivity is sparse and weak, and in-vivo MSN firing patterns may reflect both cortical driving and intrinsically generated MSN network dynamics. Recent studies suggest that phasic in-vivo MSN activity can be partially generated internally within the striatum through the activation of distinct coherent MSN cell assemblies. These cell assemblies fire coherently in recurrent sequential episodes and generate complex spatio-temporal patterns, while network transition matrices display abrupt transitions between different active cell assemblies. In conclusion, the local MSN network can generate stimulus-dependent dynamical activity patterns for long time periods after variations in cortical excitation, optimizing its function in temporally delayed reinforcement learning tasks strongly recruiting the striatum.
Polarized exocytosis and endocytosis are two essential processes in cells that are functionally linked and generally considered separate events. However, recent studies show that the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p couples polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocytosis. After exocytosis, Sec4p binds to Las17/Bee1p, Sla1p, and Sla2p during actin patch assembly. Mutations in Sec4p and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, while the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization established that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation. These results support a model in which Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis. Activated Sec4p then promotes actin polymerization and triggers compensatory endocytosis, which controls surface expansion and kinetically refines cell polarization. In specific secretory cell types, endocytosis compensates for the expansion of cell surface area caused by vesicular transport to the plasma membrane. The coupling of endocytosis with exocytosis controls membrane expansion in Xenopus oocytes during cortical granule exocytosis and after vesicle transport to the PM in both neurons and non-neuronal cells. In polarized cell types, polarized exocytosis is also linked to a reciprocal endocytic event where membrane traffic to and from adherens junctions maintains epithelial apical-basal polarity by recycling junctional proteins. Cycles of exocytosis and endocytosis are directly coupled in all cell types, and the exocyst complex, which tethers post-Golgi vesicles to the PM during exocytosis, coordinates the two trafficking pathways at the cell surface.
A study simulated and summarized the mechanisms of acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice, which is a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. The study aimed to understand how and why key injury features emerge within hepatic lobules and why humans exhibit a wide diversity of responses. A characteristic early feature of this injury is that necrosis, proceeded by covalent adduct formation, begins perivenously, adjacent to the central vein (CV) of hepatic lobules, and then progresses outward. The study used a virtual mouse system, called Mouse Analog, to test the NAPQI zonation hypothesis, which assumes that zonation of NAPQI formation is a necessary and sufficient prerequisite to explain early perivenous necrosis. However, the study found that zonation of NAPQI formation alone is insufficient to explain early perivenous necrosis and that a parsimoniously more complex explanatory mechanism is needed, involving additional feature zonation.The study combined two equally plausible mechanism zonation features, but they too failed to meet stringent tests of sufficiency. When the two zonation features that had failed were combined into a unified mechanism, sufficiency was achieved, thus demonstrating the potential power of the virtual experiment approach. The merged mechanism provides a multilevel, multiscale causal explanation of key temporal features of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice. Additionally, the study discovered that variants of the merged mechanism provide plausible quantitative explanations for the considerable variation in 24-hour necrosis scores among 37 genetically diverse mouse strains following a single toxic acetaminophen dose.In summary, the study found that zonation of NAPQI formation alone is insufficient to explain early perivenous necrosis and that a more complex explanatory mechanism is needed, involving additional feature zonation. The study's use of a virtual mouse system, called Mouse Analog, proved to be a valuable tool in challenging and testing the NAPQI zonation hypothesis and in discovering new insights into the mechanisms of acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice. The study's findings have important implications for understanding and predicting drug-induced liver injury in humans.
The Chagas congenital transmission guidelines recommend diagnosing infants born to Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers through the detection of parasites by INP micromethod and/or the persistence of T. cruzi-specific antibody titers at 10-12 months of age. A study of 51 children congenitally infected with T. cruzi showed that parasitemia levels varied based on age and diagnosis method. Group A, diagnosed in the first month after delivery, had a median parasitemia of 1,700 Pe/mL. Group B, diagnosed at 6 months old, had a median parasitemia of 20 Pe/mL and 500 Pe/mL at 1 and 6 months old, respectively. Group C, diagnosed by serology at around 1 year old, had a parasitemia of around 5 Pe/mL, 800 Pe/mL, and 20 Pe/mL at 1, 6, and 12 months after delivery, respectively. These results highlight the need for more sensitive screening methods to ensure early diagnosis of T. cruzi congenital infection, as the current trypanocidal treatment is highly effective in curing infected children. T. cruzi congenital transmission is an increasing public health problem in non-endemic areas and migrant populations. The mother-to-child transmission rate varies in endemic areas, and the failure to detect parasites in infected newborns may be due to the low sensitivity of the assay. A more sensitive screening method is needed for T. cruzi-infected babies at birth in endemic areas.
The authors propose a biophysical model of E. coli that predicts growth rate and cellular composition based on an effective, coarse-grained representation of its genome. They assume the bacterium is in a state of balanced exponential steady-state growth in a resource-rich, constant environment. The model is used to reproduce measurements of growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio for seven E. coli strains with varying rRNA operon copy numbers. The model suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied, and predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven results in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins, which would not significantly increase the growth rate due to prolonged diffusion times and weakened binding affinities. The authors propose that the wild-type copy number of rRNA operons in E. coli, which is seven, has been selectively maintained and cannot be reduced or increased to substantially alter the growth rate. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between genome and growth rate, and the impact of global biophysical effects resulting from high volume fraction of macromolecules in E. coli. The model may help elucidate how E. coli works on a global scale and suggest experiments for further investigation.
RSM1, a MYB-related transcription factor, plays a role in plant development, stress responses, and plant hormone signaling, including ABA and abiotic stress responses. The expression of RSM1 is regulated by ABA, NaCl, and mannitol during seed germination and seedling development. RSM1 interacts with HY5/HYH to regulate responses of seed germination and seedling development to ABA and salinity in Arabidopsis. RSM1 expression is induced by ABA and high salinity in 7-day-old seedlings of Col-0 wild-type. RSM1-overexpressing seedlings are hypersensitive to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol regarding seed germination and cotyledon greening, while rsm1 rsm2 rsm3 triple mutant displayed reduced sensitivity to ABA and NaCl treatments. RSM1 is involved in ABA and salinity stress responses during seed germination and seedling development. Overexpression of RSM1 enhances the tolerance of seedlings to high salinity. RSM1 overexpression results in reduced relative electrolyte leakage in comparison with that of WT plants, indicating that RSM1 enhances the tolerance of plants to high salinity during seedling development. RSM1 mediates ABA signaling by regulating ABI5, ABF3, and ABF4 expression during seed germination with or without ABA treatment, while it does not seem to regulate major upstream ABA signaling components such as PP2Cs and SnRK2.2s. RSM1 may enhance the tolerance of plants to high salinity during seedling development by binding to the ABI5 promoter and regulating ABI5 expression. RSM1 may function as a transcription factor by binding to the ABI5 promoter to regulate ABI5 expression and thus influence the ABA signaling pathway. ABI5 is downstream of RSM1 in the processes of seed germination and seedling development.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most intricate proton pump in the respiratory chain, is responsible for transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone while pumping four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Its redox reactions occur in the hydrophilic peripheral arm, distant from the membrane domain, through long-range conformational coupling. A recent study investigated the proton pumping mechanism in the membrane arm by analyzing a subcomplex (nb8mΔ) of the complex I from Yarrowia. The nb8mΔ subcomplex lacks the distal part of the membrane domain and is missing two of the three subunits (ND4 and ND5) with homology to bacterial Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters, which are prime candidates for housing the proton pumps. However, nb8mΔ can still pump protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme, indicating the presence of two functionally distinct pump modules in the membrane arm. These modules are connected in series by a long helical transmission element, and their identification provides insight into the molecular mechanism of proton pumping in complex I. This research enhances our understanding of the proton pumping mechanism in complex I and offers valuable information for further studies in the field.
Fever, an initial and nonspecific response to infections, plays a key role in improving survival and shortening disease duration in mammals. It is known to play a role in modulating immune responses to infection, and new research suggests that febrile temperatures may regulate antigen binding affinity to antibodies. A study using isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA found that selected malarial and dengue antigens against specific monoclonal antibodies had a marked increase in the affinity of these antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C, compared to physiological or pathophysiological temperatures. Thermal priming of protein partners prior to measurements further increased their binding affinity. These results suggest a positive and adaptive role for fever in vivo and highlight the favorable role of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity for samples with limited availability. The study used antigens from dengue virus serotype 2 and Plasmodium vivax, and their corresponding monoclonal IgG antibodies. The results showed a peak in the affinity constant of the protein partners at 40°C, largely due to an entropic contribution to binding, followed by a notable decrease at 42°C, possibly due to protein unfolding. These results may be relevant for unravelling the physiological mechanisms that are activated during fever-inducing infections.
The actomyosin cortex, a layer of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors beneath the plasma membrane, is crucial for cellular morphogenesis and generates cortical flows. These flows are driven by gradients of active contractile stress and opposed by an effectively viscous resistance. A computational model was constructed to bridge the microscopic description of cross-linked actomyosin networks and the coarse-grained description of an active fluid, using actin filaments as simple springs with asymmetric compliance, molecular friction at filament crossover points for cross-link dynamics, and force coupling on a subset of filament cross-over points for motor activity. The study characterized the passive response of a cross-linked network to externally applied stress, the buildup and maintenance of active stress against an external resistance, and steady state flows produced by an asymmetric distribution of active motors in which active stress and passive resistance are dynamically balanced across the network. The results reveal how network remodeling can tune cortical flow through simultaneous effects on active force generation and passive resistance to network deformation. This understanding of the interplay between network architecture, motor activity, and filament turnover in force production, dissipation, and long-range cortical flow is crucial in understanding various cellular processes like cell polarization, cell division, cell crawling, and multicellular tissue morphogenesis.
A QTL analysis was conducted to study seedling sensitivity to high sugar in Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically examining a glucose and fructose-sensing QTL, GSQ11. GSQ11 was mapped and confirmed in both Col and C24 backgrounds, and was found to lie within the ANAC060 gene. The Col ANAC060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Col ANAC060 affects splicing patterns, resulting in a truncated ANAC060 protein lacking a transmembrane domain. This truncated protein is constitutively located in the nucleus and reduces ABA induction and ABA signaling, leading to sugar insensitivity. Glucose induces GSQ11/ANAC060 expression through abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, and ABI4 directly binds to the GSQ11/ANAC060 promoter to activate transcription. Col ANAC060 reduces ABA sensitivity and Glc-induced ABA accumulation, and ABI4 expression is also reduced in Col ANAC060 lines, demonstrating a negative feedback loop between nuclear ANAC060 and ABA signaling. This sugar-ABA signaling cascade and truncated Col ANAC060 protein attenuate ABA induction and ABA signaling, leading to sugar insensitivity.
"The second messenger signaling molecule, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), is crucial for regulating various behaviors in eubacteria, such as the transition from planktonic to biofilm communities. However, the signaling specificity of c-di-GMP control modules and regulated cellular functions is unclear. A study on Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that c-di-GMP signaling gains output specificity through interaction with the HptB pathway. The hsbD gene, located near the hptB and flagellar genes cluster, is involved in biofilm formation and motility through the HptB pathway, which controls behaviors like twitching, swimming, swarming motility, and chemotaxis. The HptB pathway's central component is the HsbA phosphorylation state, which determines partner binding and impacts P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. The RsmY small regulatory RNA levels are modulated by the HptB pathway, influencing the Gac/Rsm cascade, which controls the switch between ""planktonic/virulent"" and ""sessile/biofilm"" behaviors. A new DGC, HsbD, was discovered, which regulates twitching, swarming, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation. This DGC interacts with the HptB pathway and the Gac/Rsm pathway, providing insights into how c-di-GMP signaling can be orchestrated in bacteria to achieve output specificity."
In a series of experiments, participants performed a target-pointing task with manipulated visual feedback based on target shape, which was morphed between spiky and circular shapes. The research aimed to understand the associative learning between cue (target shape) and required visuomotor mapping and how learning generalizes to novel but similar conditions. Two hypotheses were tested: explicit extraction of a linear relationship between target shape and visuomotor mapping, and a Bayesian learning model predicting generalization consistent with categorization. The results showed that learning the associations required explicit awareness of the cues’ role, and participants applied the mapping corresponding to the trained shape most similar to the current one. The Bayesian learning model accurately predicted learning rates and generalization, indicating its potential as a mechanism for learning multiple visuomotor mappings. This research highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between contextual cues and sensorimotor mappings in adapting to changes in the environment.
The inferior olivary nucleus plays a crucial role in motor control by providing one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum, the climbing fibers, which are related to the timing of motor commands and/or motor learning. The climbing fiber leads to large all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells, overriding any other ongoing activity and silencing these cells for a brief period of time. The climbing fiber can transmit a short burst of spikes as a result of an olivary cell somatic spike, potentially increasing the information being transferred to the cerebellum per climbing fiber activation. The cerebellum, which ensures smooth and well-timed execution of ongoing motor tasks, receives input from two channels: mossy fibers carrying information from many brain regions, and climbing fibers carrying information about sensory events. The inferior olivary nucleus, located in the ventral brainstem, gives rise to the climbing fibers and plays a vital role in the functioning of the cerebellum. Its unique electrophysiological properties include a low firing rate of around 1 Hz under natural conditions, a slow sub-threshold oscillation of the membrane potential with a frequency that typically ranges from 2 to 10 Hz, and cells that are densely coupled by connexin36 gap junctions. Olivary spikes have a characteristic shape starting with a fast sodium spike followed by an after-depolarization due to dendritic P/Q calcium channels and a long after-hyperpolarization. Olivary cells, while firing at a very low frequency, can transmit a burst of spikes along the axon for each somatic action potential, the spikes of which correspond with small spikelets on top of the ADP of the somatic spike. These bursts can vary in size and may be related to the phase of the IO cell's STO at the time the cell fired. A computational modeling approach has been used to investigate the factors primarily determining the CF burst size and the information it potentially carries, revealing that charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst and phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can have a big effect on the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells.
Iron, essential for life, is involved in various processes such as oxygen transport, respiration, and biosynthesis. However, iron regulation is crucial because iron deficiency can lead to debilitating anemia, while iron excess can cause free radical generation and is involved in many diseases. The liver plays a central role in iron regulation through the secretion of the peptide hormone hepcidin. A mathematical model was constructed to analyze the hepatic biochemical network involved in iron sensing and regulation. The model was validated by comparison with experimental data from multiple physiological studies, showing quantitatively and qualitatively how an iron overload phenotype occurs in patients with a HFE mutation. The model integrated various data sources for parameterization, representing a clinical translational approach, improving our understanding of human iron metabolism. Examining the behavior of the model through simulation at different initial conditions or parameters is essential to establish the limits of utility of the model. Model validation was carried out by simulating haemochromatosis disease, where the model behavior matched clinical data. The model supports current understanding that the interaction of TfR2 and HFE form the signal transduction pathway that leads to the induction of hepcidin expression. The global metabolic control analysis results support the identification of the transferrin receptors, particularly TfR2, and HFE as potential therapeutic targets; however, it is essential to express with some reservation that stems from the fact that the global sensitivity analysis identified the hepcidin synthesis and degradation reactions in the group with the largest uncertainty.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a crucial structure in eukaryotic cells, controlling the material transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The NPC is highly conserved across different species, and its dysfunction can lead to various diseases, including cancers, influenza, and viral infections. Despite its significance, the NPC's transport mechanism remains elusive. However, recent studies have established a coarse-grained model of the NPC that mimics nucleocytoplasmic transport using a computational approach. The NPC is composed of about 30 distinct proteins, known as nucleoporins, and it acts as a freeway for passive diffusion of molecules smaller than ∼5 nm in diameter while actively controlling and facilitating the transport of larger cargos up to about 39–40 nm.The transport mechanism is based on the interaction of karyopherins (kaps) with FG-repeat domains inside the NPC. Kaps are soluble proteins that shuttle different cargos between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm via the NPC in a process known as nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT). A single NPC can accommodate a remarkable rate of transport on the order of ∼1000 translocations/sec, corresponding to a mass flow of ∼100 MDa/sec. The key feature in NCT is the interaction of kap with FG-repeats, which are natively unfolded domains of phenylalanine-glycine repeats within the NPC. The coarse-grained model of the NPC, therefore, considers all the structural groups of nups with their corresponding functions to investigate the NCT mechanism at a fine resolution both in time and space from a biophysical perspective. The simulations show that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is approximately 2.6±0.13 ms, which is statistically adequate, and the cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall where it interacts with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. The kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring an efficient translocation through the NPC. Furthermore, almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport. In contrast, cytoplasmic filaments-deficient NPCs show a high degree of permeability to inert cargos, implying the defining role of cytoplasmic filaments in the selectivity barrier. Overall, the coarse-grained model provides valuable insights into the NCT mechanism, which can be further utilized to examine different hypotheses about transport and examine different factors that alter transport.
The nonhuman primate (NHP) model is often used to test interventions designed to block infection by human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. A limiting dose of the infectious agent is used in a physiological model, and determining the challenge dose is critical to the success of the experiment. An optimized protocol for defining the dose of pathogen that infects 50% of the time (AID50) is presented, which minimizes the number of animals and resources while providing an estimate of the AID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value. NHPs are the preferred animal models for testing vaccines and therapeutics for various infectious diseases, but significant ethical and economic constraints accompany such models. A limiting infectious dose is often used to mimic the potential clinical impact of vaccination or therapeutic intervention, and careful titration of the infectious agent is required. A 2-fold error in the challenge dose can significantly impact the power of an experiment. The Reed and Muench method, published almost 80 years ago, is commonly used to estimate the AID50, but it is not optimized for parsimony. A more efficient protocol is proposed, which will, on average, only use 15 animals to estimate the AID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value. The proposed protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and any animal model.
"The study focuses on a first-order auditory interneuron (AN2) in crickets, examining how its response adapts to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli. The researchers found that adaptation shifts the stimulus-response curves towards higher stimulus intensities, reducing the spike responses to low-intensity sounds. They compared the experimental results with two competing hypotheses: infomax and selective coding. Infomax predicts that information conveyed about the entire signal range should be maximized, while selective coding predicts that ""foreground"" signals should be enhanced, and ""background"" signals should be suppressed. The findings indicate that adaptation reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals, contradicting the infomax principle. The response curve changes are also not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis.The authors highlight the importance of understanding the principles behind sensory adaptation, particularly in simple sensory networks of invertebrates, where feedback signals have minimal influence on representation. Two principles underlie adaptation: infomax and selective coding (or ""background suppression""). Infomax aims to maximize information transmission between the neural representation and the stimulus, while selective coding segregates a single, important signal from other signals or background noise.The study used crickets as an ideal model system to study object-background segregation due to their limited carrier frequency modulation and broadly tuned frequency channels. The goal was to determine how the neural response curve adapts to the statistics of the acoustic environment and if the system can be characterized as a communication channel optimized for coding inputs (infomax principle) or if it performs preprocessing for high fidelity representation of only the loudest part of the stimuli (selective coding).Experiments were conducted on AN2 neurons of two cricket species, T. oceanicus and T. leo. Acoustic stimuli were amplitude-modulated signals with varying durations and silent intervals. The intensity response curves were determined using spike count in a 200 ms time window after test stimulus onset. The researchers used Bayesian analysis to estimate the parameters accurately and quantify the confidence limits of the parameter estimation.The study found that adaptation reduces the amount of encoded information, which contradicts the infomax principle. The response curve changes are not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis either, as information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal remains nearly constant. Overall, the findings suggest that the AN2 neuron adaptation does not appear to optimize information transmission or segregate important signals from background noise based on the infomax or selective coding principles."
Prions, which are infectious proteinaceous particles that cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases, propagate by autocatalysis, binding the normal cellular protein PrPC to induce conversion into a new PrPSc molecule. However, the mechanisms of binding and conversion are unclear. Previous studies suggest that two polybasic regions of PrPC, the N-PBD and C-PBD, may serve as docking sites for PrPSc. To investigate the role of these domains in the context of full-length PrPC, a study using Chinese hamster ovary cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) reactions found that PrPSc molecules lacking the central polybasic domain (ΔC) were formed, and these ΔC-PrPSc prions could bind to and induce quantitative conversion of all polybasic domain mutant substrates into PrPSc molecules. However, ΔC-PrPSc and other polybasic domain deficient PrPSc molecules displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild-type PrPSc. These results suggest that the propagation of PrPSc molecules may not depend on a single stereotypic mechanism, but that normal PrPC/PrPSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required to generate prion infectivity. This study provides a unique opportunity to dissect the relationship between the ability to seed formation of wild type PrPSc molecules in vitro and prion infectivity in vivo.
The study discusses the development of an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework to identify behavioral strategies of animals using time-series data. The authors apply this framework to thermotactic behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) worms, which show different responses to temperature based on their feeding status. The IRL approach revealed that fed worms use both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative, while starved worms only use the absolute temperature for their behavior. The study also found that different neural mechanisms underlie these strategies, with the AFD neurons being fundamental for directed migration in fed worms. This IRL-based approach can reveal the optimal state for animals and how they reach that state, providing insights into the computational principles of the nervous system. The study highlights the potential of IRL in identifying behavioral strategies in various biological organisms and decision-making processes.
Haptophytes are crucial players in aquatic ecosystems, contributing significantly to global carbon sequestration, forming harmful blooms, and serving as a nutritive food source for various organisms. The mixotrophic nature of many haptophyte taxa supports their dominance in fresh and marine waters. Although the nuclear genome sequence of only one haptophyte, Emiliania huxleyi, is available, the genome sequence of Chrysochromulina tobin (Prymnesiales) has been recently reported, along with transcriptome data collected at seven time points over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. The C. tobin genome is small (59 Mb), compact (∼40% of the genome is protein-coding), and encodes approximately 16,777 genes. The genome harbors the first hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene complex reported for an algal species and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. Additionally, a new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin and two “red” RuBisCO activases were also identified. The C. tobin genome provides valuable information on the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes. Haptophytes are a diverse lineage of eukaryotes that have significantly impacted global ecology, including CO2 sequestration, the production of dimethyl sulfide, toxicity, foam and mucilage production, and trophic value, given their high levels of fatty acids. Recent metagenomic studies have revealed the true extent of haptophyte dominance in aquatic ecosystems, contributing 30% to 40% of the total photosynthetic standing stock in the world’s oceans and dominating freshwater lakes. Haptophytes’ fitness versatility, such as being mixotrophic, helps explain their prevalence in algal populations, making them important for commercial endeavors targeting aquaculture feed stocks, nutraceuticals, plastics, or biofuel production. Genomic information also supports efforts to understand the fundamental metabolic processes associated with the genesis of harmful algal bloom events.
"In this passage, the authors discuss the relationship between certain genetic factors and the development of aggressive breast cancers, specifically those that are ""triple-negative,"" meaning they do not express the estrogen receptor (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), or HER2. These triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are often characterized by the Basal-like molecular subtype and are associated with defects in the Rb, p53, and BRCA1 pathways. The authors' mouse genetic studies have shown that the combined inactivation of the Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution, and the concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency, leading to the development of highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors have histological features similar to those seen in human BRCA1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses suggest that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures. The authors note that mouse models that accurately mimic the complexity of TNBC will be essential for understanding the diverse cellular biology and behavior of these tumors and for rigorously testing new drug candidates. The study of TNBCs and Basal-like breast cancers has been driven by the need for more effective treatments for aggressive breast cancers. TNBCs are heterogeneous in their clinical behavior, morphology, and molecular biology, and are often insensitive to endocrine therapy and HER2 antagonists. While they are sensitive to chemotherapy, long-term patient outcomes are poor due to high rates of relapse and acquired chemoresistance. Basal-like breast cancers often simultaneously inactivate three tumor suppressors that are infamous for their roles in familial cancers: Rb (RB1), p53 (TP53), and BRCA1. The loss of these tumor suppressors is likely pleiotropic, with BRCA1 having important functions in orchestrating DNA double-strand break repair and as a transcription factor that appears to be required for the differentiation of stem/progenitor cells into mature luminal cells."
The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of dengue, the most important arboviral infection globally. Its control is essential until an effective vaccine is licensed and administered. Accurate predictions of vector populations are required to assess control methods and develop effective population reduction strategies. Aedes aegypti develops primarily in artificial water holding containers, and most adult mosquitoes do not disperse over long distances. Therefore, it is expected that containers in an area of high development site density are more likely to be oviposition sites and to be more frequently used as oviposition sites than containers that are relatively isolated from other development sites. Pupal surveys conducted in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, from 2004 to 2007, showed that the number of suitable larval development sites and their density in the environment were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti pupae. A hurdle model, which accounts for the large number of zeroes and overdispersion present in pupal population counts, was used to assess the effect of larval development site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. The results showed that containers more frequently used as oviposition sites are likely to produce adult mosquitoes consistently and at a higher rate. Therefore, an ecological approach that accounts for development site density is appropriate for predicting Ae. aegypti population levels and developing efficient vector control programs.
The bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans uses external cues and internal metabolic state to make behavioral and developmental decisions, particularly in response to food availability. The TORC2 complex controls multiple processes in response to stressors and growth factors, and is involved in regulating C. elegans' development and behavior in response to food availability. During development, pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate the expression of the daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide in sensory neurons to promote a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of both daf-7 and daf-28, providing a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in the regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. In adults, TORC2 similarly acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDFR-1 neuropeptide signaling-dependent pathway. Genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and TORC2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain. Nutritional experience regulates developmental trajectories and behavioral decisions, and modulates physiological state across phyla. The intestine plays a role in nutrient acquisition, and gut-to-brain signaling plays an important role in regulating both developmental and behavioral traits in C. elegans.
The transcriptional regulation of pluripotent cells is of significant interest and has implications for directing the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells and reprogramming somatic cells. To understand the mechanisms behind this regulation, researchers analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and primordial germ cells, identifying genes upregulated in pluripotent cells both in vitro and in vivo. These genes are enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A novel computational algorithm, CompMoby, was developed to predict short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression by combining analyses of sequences aligned and non-aligned between different genomes with a probabilistic segmentation model. CompMoby was used to identify conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, which were shown to be preferentially active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner and to act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter. The activity of the motifs is conserved in human ES cells. The transcription factor NF-Y specifically binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species.
The replication of non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses requires a continuous supply of the nucleoprotein (N) in a complex with the phosphoprotein (P). This study characterizes a soluble, heterodimeric complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (NΔ21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P60) encompassing the MoRE of P that binds RNA-free N (N0). The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form, solved at 3.0 Å resolution, reveals how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and NMR spectroscopy confirm the binding of the MoRE and indicate that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure also suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. This research has implications for understanding the replication of negative-sense RNA viruses, which include numerous major human pathogens such as influenza virus, rabies virus, measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus.
The study of the computational implications of specific synaptic connectivity patterns is crucial in neuroscience, particularly the role of ubiquitous electrical synapses operating via gap junctions. In the fly visual system, the vertical-system (VS) network, which plays a key role in visual processing, primarily connects to each other via axonal gap junctions. This network provides a unique opportunity to explore the functional role of gap junctions in sensory information processing. An information theoretical analysis of a realistic VS network model shows that within 10 ms following the onset of the visual input, the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation (θ) of the fly’s ego motion with near-optimal efficiency. The VS network is connected to downstream pathways via a subset of triplets of the vertical system cells, and it was found that the efficiency of this subpopulation in encoding θ is superior to that of the whole vertical system network and is robust to a wide range of signal to noise ratios. Efficient encoding of motion by this subpopulation is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. The gap junctions, being formed among the axons of the vertical system cells, only impact the system’s readout while maintaining the dendritic input intact, suggesting that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be much richer than previously assumed from point neuron models. Overall, the study provides new insights as to how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli and that the principles governing synaptic connectivity may hold the key to understanding the functional organization of the brain.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a significant cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children and has been associated with neurological diseases, including fatal cases, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. A recent study identified human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as a functional cellular receptor for EV71. PSGL-1 is a sialomucin membrane protein expressed on immune cells, and its N-terminal region is critical for PSGL-1 binding to P- , E- and L-selectins, as well as EV71. Post-translational modifications such as O-glycosylation and tyrosine sulfation in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 contribute to efficient binding to selectins and EV71.The study found that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 plays a critical role in EV71-PB binding to PSGL-1 and for virus entry and subsequent replication of EV71-PB in Jurkat T cells. Sodium chlorate, a sulfation inhibitor, significantly impairs EV71-PB binding to PSGL-1 in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits PSGL-1-dependent replication of EV71-PB strains in Jurkat T cells. These findings suggest that the virus-receptor interaction may be a promising target for potential antiviral agents and that tyrosine sulfation may regulate not only the migration of immune cells but also the infectivity of viruses. Therefore, tyrosine sulfation seems to be a common phenomenon in chemokine receptors expressed on immune cells and may be involved in EV71 entry into target cells, making it a potential target for antiviral agents.
Leishmaniasis is a significant global health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide and caused by the Leishmania parasite. While treatments are available, they are limited by drug toxicicity and the emergence of resistant strains. A study was conducted to test the therapeutic efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in controlling Leishmania major infection in mice. Rapamycin, GSK-2126458, and KU-0063794 were administered to mice infected with L. major, and footpad swelling, parasite burden, cytokine production, and T cell activation were evaluated. Results showed that treatment with rapamycin and GSK-2126458, but not KU-0063794, lowered both footpad swelling and parasite load. The employed dose of rapamycin did not kill the parasites in vitro, but reduced IL-4 production and increased IFN-γ:IL-4 production ratio, suggesting a Th1-skewed cytokine profile. Additionally, rapamycin enhanced the expression of CD69, an early activation marker, on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors, particularly rapamycin and GSK-2126458, may be useful in therapeutic settings for leishmaniasis, potentially through immunomodulatory properties. The adjuvanticity of mTOR inhibitors may also be considered in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.
Natural transformation is a widespread biological process in bacteria where they take up free DNA and incorporate it into their genomes, leading to genetic alterations. This process is crucial for evolution and generates genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer. In the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, natural transformation plays a vital role in gene reassortment and virulence. The uptake of DNA is facilitated by surface-exposed receptors, such as ComP in Neisseria species, which is a crucial component of type IV pili and has a marked preference for specific DNA uptake sequences (DUS). Recent findings have identified ComP as the long-sought DUS receptor, and variations in DUS have been found to impair transformation in N. meningitidis. The identification of ComP as the DUS receptor has opened new avenues for understanding the molecular events involved in the earliest step of natural transformation and reveals an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche.
In a study using fission yeast, it was found that the paxillin homolog Pxl1 and the enzyme Bgs1, responsible for linear β (1, 3) glucan synthesis and primary septum formation, are required for stable anchorage of the contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) to the plasma membrane before septation onset and for cleavage furrow formation. Pxl1 concentration at the CAR increases during cytokinesis, and this increase depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. Bgs1 depletion in cells carrying a cdc15ΔSH3 allele causes ring disassembly and septation blockage, as it does in cells lacking Pxl1. The absence of Pxl1 is lethal when Cdc15 function is affected, causing a large sliding of the CAR with deposition of septum wall material along the cell cortex, indicating additional functions for both Pxl1 and Cdc15 proteins. Therefore, CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane through Cdc15 and Pxl1, and concomitant Bgs1 activity, are necessary for CAR maintenance and septum formation in fission yeast.
Glanders, a deadly zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia mallei, has re-emerged in several countries including Asia, the Middle-East, Africa, and South America. Although eradicated in many Western countries, the disease has resurfaced in Bahrain, where an outbreak in 2010 and 2011 was caused by two different B. mallei strains, indicating two independent introductions. High-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing revealed that the Bahrain samples were more closely related to B. mallei isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004, suggesting repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations to each other may indicate a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains. Glanders, which can be transmitted by aerosol and is fatal to both animals and humans, is listed as a category B bio-threat agent by the CDC. Officially, Bahrain was free of glanders until the 2010 outbreak in the north (Jannusan, Shakhurah and Saar municipalities) that began in April 2010. Horses imported from Syria via Kuwait were suspected of introducing glanders and all equines in the area were quarantined and tested. By September 2010, the outbreak was considered to be resolved, but in January 2011, the disease reoccurred in the same region of the country. Isolates from both events in Bahrain and the 2004 UAE outbreak were analyzed using MLVA and next-generation whole genome sequencing, which revealed that the recent outbreak in Bahrain was caused by two different B. mallei strains, suggesting two independent introductions.
American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is a complex disease causing approximately 67,000 new cases per year. The severity of the disease depends on the parasite species, but species confirmation is not usually feasible. The WHO recommends pentavalent antimonial derivatives, such as Glucantime or Sodium Stibogluconate, as the first-line treatment for ACL caused by Leishmania braziliensis. However, the healing rate of these derivatives is around 75%, and the reasons for treatment failure are not well understood. A cross-sectional observational study of 43 patients with ACL who did not respond to Glucantime treatment found that 35% of the parasites isolated showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility after previous administration of the medication. Lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite were negatively correlated with a decline in Glucantime susceptibility. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between lesion size and parasite resistance. The main parasite species associated with treatment failure or relapse was L. braziliensis. Therefore, the indication of a second round of treatment in therapeutic failure of ACL, produced by L. braziliensis, with pentavalent antimonial derivatives is discussable. Overall, ACL is a complex disease, and treatment response is highly dependent on the parasite species and host immune background.
In Escherichia coli, the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores (enterobactin, salmochelins, and yersiniabactin) and a genotoxin (colibactin) require a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). Only two PPTases, EntD and ClbA, have been clearly identified. EntD is part of the core genome, while ClbA is encoded on the pks pathogenicity island, which is associated with the high pathogenicity island (HPI) in highly virulent E. coli strains. Inactivation of both entD and clbA abolished the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) in a mouse sepsis model. A potential interplay between the synthesis pathways leading to the production of siderophores and the colibactin genotoxin was demonstrated through the functional interchangeability between EntD and ClbA. ClbA can contribute to siderophores synthesis, and the presence of either functional EntD or ClbA is required for the survival of ExPEC in vivo. This suggests that the strict association of the pks island with HPI has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because ClbA is a promiscuous PPTase that can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores. The data highlight the complex regulatory interaction of various virulence features with different functions and the potential for anti-virulence therapy strategies.
A fundamental task in sequence analysis is calculating the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree relating the sequences and an evolutionary model describing how sequences change over time. However, while many phylogenetic models account for residue substitution events, they often ignore insertion and deletion events. A probabilistic model is described that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by the gap character. The model assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. This model was applied to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip, and it was shown to improve accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps while retaining computational efficiency. This is important because many sequence analysis problems, such as HMMs and SCFGs for homology search and genefinding, account for insertion and deletion events in their probabilistic framework, and it would be advantageous to integrate evolutionary modeling into these models.
In this study, the mechanism of initiating immunity to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is explored, specifically focusing on how HSV infects the mucosal epidermis and enters nerve endings, and how it interacts with dendritic cells (DCs) in human skin. The researchers used human foreskin explants topically infected with HSV-1 and compared them with biopsies of initial human genital herpes lesions. They found that Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epidermis are initially infected, then emigrate into the dermis, forming large clusters with BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ DCs/macrophages. These clusters are likely the site of viral antigen transfer and presentation to T cells, suggesting a potential target for mucosal or intradermal HSV immunization. Overall, this study furthers our understanding of HSV pathogenesis and may inform the development of vaccines and immunization strategies.
Intracellular parasitism by Leishmania species involves the customization of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) by the parasites, and this study compares PV biogenesis in primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to Leishmania major or L. amazonensis. The research reveals three dynamic features of Leishmania amastigote-housing PVs, including the entry of Lysotracker transients within tight-fitting, fission-prone L. major amastigote-housing PVs, the decrease in the number of macrophage acidic vesicles during L. major PV fission or L. amazonensis PV enlargement, and the L. amazonensis PV remodeling after homotypic fusion. The findings demonstrate Leishmania species-specific differences in PV biogenesis/remodeling and provide insights into the mechanisms of intracellular parasitism by Leishmania species. The study of PV biogenesis is essential for understanding the interactions between intracellular microorganisms and their host cells, and the results could be useful for the study of other intracellular microorganisms. Overall, this research contributes to the field of cell biology of intracellular parasitism by enhancing our understanding of PV biogenesis and remodeling in Leishmania species.
Homology-directed repair is a crucial mechanism for maintaining and altering genomic structure, and it plays a key role in immunoglobulin gene diversification in chicken B cells. A study using the chicken B cell line DT40 found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin, and that chromatin structure plays an important role in gene conversion. A regulatable experimental system was used to demonstrate that tethering the heterochromatin protein HP1 to the pseudo-Vλ donor array within the immunoglobulin Vλ locus diminished histone acetylation and altered the outcome of Vλ diversification, leading to an increase in nontemplated mutations. These results suggest that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences. Overall, this study highlights the importance of chromatin structure in regulating homology-directed repair and genomic stability.
The cerebellum plays a crucial role in rapidly adjusting motor behavior to fit the situation, and cerebellum-based motor learning is thought to be guided by the difference between desired and actual behavior, with error information used to modify parallel fiber synapses on Purkinje cells. However, new research challenges this concept by demonstrating that olivary climbing fibers, which transport error information needed for synaptic modification, also contribute to error memory. In a saccadic learning paradigm, complex spikes (CS) were observed not only at the time of error occurrence but also as a reverberation before a new behavior manifestation, suitable for improving it. These findings suggest that the climbing fiber system helps conserve information on error for future use, rather than being limited to conveying information on instant errors.
ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons and the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions rich in the TDP-43 protein. TDP-4
Chagas disease is a significant public health issue in many Latin American countries, with an estimated 6-7 million people infected worldwide. The disease has a diversity of clinical manifestations, from indeterminate to cardiac and/or digestive forms, which can be associated with the genetic diversity of the parasite, host factors, and environmental and epidemiological factors. The parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, is represented by a set of populations with different levels of pathogenicity, sensitivity to drugs, and disease prognosis, as well as eco-epidemiological complexity. In 2009, the scientific community classified T. cruzi isolates into six discrete typing units (DTUs) based on molecular markers and biological characteristics. TcI has been associated with the cardiac form of the disease in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela, while TcII, TcV, and TcVI have been reported to cause all clinical manifestations. TcIII and TcIV are commonly associated with sylvatic cycles and related to oral outbreaks in the Amazon region and Venezuela. However, recent studies have reported patients infected by TcIII in Brazil, which was previously uncommon. Quantitative PCR is used to monitor the parasite load during etiological treatment and could be valuable as an indicator of therapeutic failure in Chagas disease. A recent study evaluated the association between T. cruzi DTUs and the clinical manifestations of the disease using molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. The study found that patients infected by TcII had significantly higher parasite loads compared to patients infected by TcVI. The results contribute to updating the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the age of the patient and infection by TcII as important features that lead to the observation of higher parasitemia levels.
In a study conducted in Guatemala from 2009-2011, 672 bats of 31 species were tested for rabies virus (RABV) as part of a larger pathogen detection program. The prevalence of RABV detection among all collected bats was low (0.3%), but infectious virus was isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). RABV was also detected in oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, and viral RNA was detected in all of the tissues examined except for the liver of one bat. The two vampire bat RABV isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggestive of complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation. This study highlights the importance of bats as potential hosts and reservoirs for RABV and the need for continued surveillance and research to understand the transmission and epidemiology of this deadly virus.
The nuclear lamina, which is a structure located under the inner nuclear membrane and provides structural integrity to the nucleus, plays a role in maintaining heterochromatin and regulating gene silencing. It is also involved in the transcription and replication of the Herpes simplex virus (HSV). In HSV-infected cells, the replication compartments, where viral DNA replication and late gene transcription occur, form at the nuclear periphery. The nuclear lamina and lamin A/C, a major component of the nuclear lamina, are found to be associated with the HSV DNA replication protein ICP8. In HSV-infected A-type lamin-deficient (Lmna−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target to the nuclear periphery. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV DNA is associated with increased heterochromatin in Lmna−/− MEFs. These results suggest that A-type lamins are required for the targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The nuclear lamina may serve as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications.
Mitochondria, originating from proteobacterial endosymbionts, required protein import pathways as they evolved into organelles. The initial protein import is primarily mediated by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM). While TOM is common to all forms of mitochondria, its subunit composition varies unexpectedly across eukaryotic lineages. However, the basic structure of the TOM complex, specifically whether it is triplet-pore or twin-pore, remains unsettled. This study analyzed the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically specialized anaerobic form of mitochondria found in the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis. The research demonstrated that the highly divergent β-barrel T. vaginalis TOM (TvTom) 40-2 forms a translocation channel for hydrogenosomal protein import. TvTom40-2 is present in high molecular weight complexes, containing four tail-anchored (TA) proteins. Two of these, Tom36 and Tom46, function as receptors, binding hydrogenosomal preproteins. The third subunit, Tom22-like protein, lacks a trans domain but has a short cis domain and a conserved Tom22 transmembrane segment. The fourth protein, Homp19, has no known homology. The TvTOM complex is associated with sorting and assembly machinery (Sam) 50, involved in β-barrel assembly. The TvTOM complex has an unconventional skull-like shape and seems to lack Tom7, although phylogenetic profiling predicts Tom7 in free-living excavates. The findings suggest that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor, while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
The study of disease-associated genetic polymorphisms has highlighted the importance of biological context in understanding the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes. The research presented here focuses on the cell type-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with several autoimmune diseases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The results identify a common missense variant in IL27, associated with type 1 diabetes, that results in decreased functional activity of the protein and reduced expression levels of downstream IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells only. Additionally, a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13 containing the rs1131017 SNP in the RPS26 gene was identified. The power of studying expression-associated genetic variants in purified cells types has allowed for the identification of functional roles for several polymorphisms at autoimmune and even neurodegenerative disease loci. The analysis provides insights into the basic processes of the regulation of gene expression in T cells and advances understanding about the pathways involved with disease susceptibility in the adaptive immune system.
"Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), or African sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease that affects mainly poor populations living in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. It evolves in two stages, with the early stage characterized by non-specific clinical signs and the advanced stage characterized by an impairment of the central nervous system. HAT treatment options are limited and can cause severe side effects. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the new safer drug regimen, NECT (Nifurtimox-Eflornithine Combination Therapy), has replaced melarsoprol as first-line treatment for second-stage HAT. However, logistical and financial factors may interfere with its deployment. A study was conducted in the DRC to understand the origin and rationale of the beliefs towards HAT treatment and post-treatment follow-up in two provinces of the DRC: Kasaï Oriental and Bandundu. These provinces were chosen due to their high endemicity for HAT and lagging behind in the control efforts. The study used a bottom-up approach to identify the most knowledgeable interviewees, from former HAT patients to national coordinators of the PNLTHA. The study found that the non-participation of the community in HAT screening and treatment activities is due to multiple factors, including a number of community-enforced prohibitions associated with the treatment of HAT. These prohibitions include food restrictions, such as avoiding sour and ""hot"" foods, and activity restrictions, such as not engaging in heavy work, not walking in the sun, and abstaining from sexual intercourse. These restrictions have a negative impact on the participation rate of communities in HAT screening and the treatment adherence of confirmed patients. It is crucial to understand the origin and rationale of these taboos in order to improve HAT control strategies in DRC. The study found that these taboos originated from various sources and interactions between healthcare providers and the communities they serve. The study recommends addressing these barriers through informed strategies for the DRC’s HAT control program to further improve the coverage of ongoing screening and treatment activities."
Since December 2009, Médecins Sans Frontières has been diagnosing and treating visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients at Tabarak Allah Hospital in eastern Gedaref State, one of the main endemic foci of VL in Sudan. A survey was conducted to estimate the VL incidence in villages around Tabarak Allah. Between May and June 2011, a door-to-door survey was conducted in 45 villages, covering a population of about 85,000 inhabitants. The survey resulted in 16 new VL cases, with an incidence rate of 7.0/1000 persons per year. The overall incidence rate, including deaths possibly or probably due to VL, was 7.9/1000 per year. VL had been a possible or probable cause for 19% of all deaths, with a VL-specific mortality rate of 0.9/1000 persons per year. The overall incidence of VL was found to be high, indicating that VL remains a significant health burden in eastern Gedaref State. However, the yield of active VL case detection was very low, suggesting that it may not be the priority intervention to enhance control in similar contexts.
Gyrase, an enzyme composed of GyrA and GyrB proteins, is responsible for the negative supercoiling of DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction, which helps condense bacterial chromosomes into a compact interwound “nucleoid.” The supercoil density (σ) of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms: diffusible supercoil density (σD), which moves freely around the chromosome in 10 kb domains, and constrained supercoil density (σC), resulting from binding abundant proteins that bend, loop, or unwind DNA at many sites. The two forms contribute roughly equally to the total in vivo negative supercoil density of WT cells, with σ=σC+σD. Escherichia coli chromosomes have a 15% higher level of σ compared to Salmonella enterica. To understand the mechanisms that can change diffusible supercoil density of chromosomes, researchers analyzed strains of Salmonella using a 9 kb “supercoil sensor” inserted at ten positions around the genome. The sensor contains a complete Lac operon flanked by directly repeated resolvase binding sites and can monitor both supercoil density and transcription elongation rates in WT and mutant strains. RNA transcription causes (−) supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess upstream supercoiling was relaxed by Topo I, and gyrase replenished downstream supercoil losses to maintain an equilibrium state. Strains with TS gyrase mutations growing at permissive temperature exhibited significant supercoil losses varying from 30% of WT levels to a total loss of σD at most chromosome locations. Supercoil losses were influenced by transcription because addition of rifampicin (Rif) caused supercoil density to rebound throughout the chromosome. Gyrase mutants that caused dramatic supercoil losses also reduced the transcription elongation rates throughout the genome, suggesting that bacteria with fast growth rates may generate higher supercoil densities than slow growing species.
The protozoan Leishmania amazonensis, which causes a range of human diseases, infects and replicates within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in host cells. These PVs share features with late endosomes/lysosomes. During infection, host cells upregulate LYST/Beige, a gene known to regulate lysosome size. In cells infected with L. amazonensis, mutations in LYST/Beige led to further PV expansion and enhanced parasite replication, while LYST/Beige overexpression resulted in small PVs that did not support parasite growth. This suggests that PV size is crucial for parasite survival. The upregulation of LYST/Beige in infected cells functions as a host innate response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival. Fibroblasts, which play a role in latent Leishmania infections, also harbor parasites in PVs. The size of PVs in fibroblasts is more homogeneous compared to macrophages, allowing for a detailed examination of the impact of LYST/Beige expression on L. amazonensis intracellular growth. Overexpression of LYST/Beige in fibroblasts caused a significant reduction in PV size and inhibited parasite growth, providing evidence for its role in restricting the intracellular survival of L. amazonensis. L. amazonensis infection triggers an innate response in host cells, upregulating LYST/Beige expression, which blocks parasite replication if the expressed protein is functional. Reducing PV size in bgJ/bgJ fibroblasts led to a reduction in intracellular amastigotes, while enlarging PVs in YAC-bgJ/bgJ fibroblasts resulted in enhanced parasite numbers. This suggests that PV size directly modulates early intracellular survival of Leishmania.
The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a genetic neurological disorder characterized by psychomotor retardation, which is caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene. The MCT8 protein is responsible for the neuronal entry of thyroid hormone (TH), and its dysfunction leads to impaired neurological development. AHDS is also associated with endocrine alterations, including decreased plasma concentration of prohormone T4 and increased concentration of the active form T3. However, the specific neurological circuits affected and the nature of the deficiencies remain unclear, and adequate treatment is not available. To study the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHDS, an MCT8 knockout (KO) mouse model was generated, but it did not exhibit neurological or behavioral phenotypes due to the compensation by the anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) at the blood-brain barrier.To overcome these limitations, a zebrafish model of AHDS was established using the zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) genome editing system to introduce a 7 bp deletion mutation in the zebrafish mct8 gene, resulting in a truncated protein. The mutated zebrafish larvae were viable and fertile, and the morphology of the larvae and adult appeared normal. However, transient expression studies and western blot confirmed that the mutation efficiently eliminates the MCT8 protein.At 3 dpf, the expression levels of TH-induced genes, such as Kruppel-like factor 9 (klf9) and neurogranin (RC3/nrgn), were increased by 49% and 46%, respectively, under T3 administration. However, in mct8−/− embryos, the expression levels of klf9 and nrnga did not change in response to T3 administration, indicating that MCT8 does not affect the expression of key TH-induced genes at 3 dpf. Moreover, MCT8 elimination did not affect the expression of alternative TH transporters or HPT-axis-related genes.These findings suggest that other TH transporters can compensate for the lack of MCT8 and balance TH transport in zebrafish larvae. However, the mRNA levels of thraa and thrab were reduced by 23% and 16%, respectively, in mct8−/− compared with their WT siblings, indicating that the loss of MCT8 affects the levels of thraa and thrab at 3 dpf.Overall, the zebrafish AHDS model provides a valuable tool to study the neurological mechanisms and treatment of AHDS and related psychomotor retardation disorders. The findings suggest that TH analogs can restore a portion of the neurological phenotypes in mct8−/− zebrafish, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents for AHDS patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major pathogen in newborns and immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, with gB and gH/gL being the core fusion machinery required for entry into cells. These two proteins form a stable complex early after synthesis and in the absence of other viral proteins. The gB-gH/gL complexes account for 16-50% of the total gH/gL in HCMV virus particles. HCMV, like other herpesviruses, requires gB and gH/gL for entry into cells, with gH/gL being activated by receptor binding or by gD for HSV-1, which then interacts with gB to trigger membrane fusion. Our study provides evidence for stable, preformed HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes in the virion envelope, which might initiate membrane fusion between the virion envelope and cellular membranes. These findings have major implications for models of herpesvirus entry and provide the best support to date for the proposal that gH/gL interacts with gB.
The paper discusses the role of mtDNA sequence variants in the onset and severity of disease and the importance of leukocyte survival in modulating human mitochondrial diseases. The study uses a heteroplasmic mouse model segregating two neutral mtDNA haplotypes to demonstrate that Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, is a critical regulator of mtDNA sequence variants in leukocytes. Gimap3 is important for T cell development and survival, and its regulation of mtDNA sequence variants suggests that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants. The study also highlights the importance of nuclear-encoded genes in regulating this selection process, as seen in the elimination of selection for the BALB mtDNA haplotype in hematopoietic tissues on the CAST/Ei nuclear background. Overall, the study suggests that Gimap3 plays an important role in mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues, and its expression has no role in regulating mtDNA copy number.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin and soft tissue infection caused by the toxin-producing environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions including Australia, where it is known as 'Bairnsdale ulcer' or 'Daintree ulcer.' In Victoria, Australia, BU is notifiable, diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is rapid and centralised, and endemic areas are mapped systematically. Previous estimates of BU's incubation period (IP) have varied; however, precise IP determination is challenging due to the mode of transmission being incompletely understood and most cases occurring in permanent residents of endemic areas. A study in Victoria estimated a mean IP of 135 days (4.5 months). Recently, BU cases in Victoria have significantly risen, and the geographic distribution has shifted. This study aimed to refine the IP estimate, assess any trend in IP over time, increase the power of statistical analyses, and consider public health implications. Of 443 patients notified between 2013 and 2016, 20 non-residents had only visited endemic regions once or multiple times within a month. These patients were the source for IP estimation, with a mean IP of 143 days (4.8 months). Univariate analysis did not identify any statistically significant relationships between IP and demographic or clinical factors. Understanding the IP of BU has been challenging; however, Victoria's unique epidemiology and comprehensive surveillance provided the opportunity to accurately define the IP for a portion of patients, contributing to knowledge of BU's epidemiology and public health interventions.
The proteins involved in cholesterol synthesis, regulation, trafficking, and signaling in various organisms share a conserved ‘sterol-sensing domain’ (SSD). Toxoplasma, an intracellular parasite, has at least one gene coding for an SSD-containing protein, TgNCR1, which is a close relative of human NPC1. TgNCR1 has many residues implicated in human NPC disease and localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane, unlike human NPC1, which localizes to endo-lysosomes. When expressed in mammalian NPC1 mutant cells, TgNCR1 restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from these organelles. Genetic disruption of NCR1 in Toxoplasma results in mutants with normal cholesterol levels but an overaccumulation of several species of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides, and abundant storage lipid bodies and long membranous tubules derived from their parasitophorous vacuoles. These mutants have a faster replication rate and are more virulent in mice than the parental strain. Therefore, TgNCR1 is ascribed a role in lipid homeostasis in Toxoplasma. Toxoplasma obtains cholesterol from host LDL after processing in host endocytic compartments, and TgNCR1 is involved in monitoring the status of various lipids, which is likely important for proper parasite growth. However, the molecular mechanism of NPC interaction to transfer cholesterol remains elusive.
Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by eye malformations, such as bilateral anophthalmia, and post-axial oligosyndactyly in the limbs. A locus for OAS was identified on 14q24.2, and homozygous predicted loss-of-function mutations in the SMOC1 gene were found in eight out of fourteen families with OAS. SMOC-1 and SMOC-2 are mammalian paralogs of Drosophila protein Pentagone, and they function as antagonists of BMP signaling during eye and limb development. Loss-of-function mutations in SMOC1 cause a significant subset of OAS cases, and inhibition of a developmentally expressed peptidase, possibly a cysteine cathepsin, may be the non-redundant developmental function of SMOC-1. The eye malformations seen in the mouse model of OAS are less severe than those seen in human OAS cases, possibly due to the difference in mutation type and the presence of 10% of normal Smoc1 transcript levels in the mouse model. The phenotype associated with a null allele in mice and the screening of a cohort of human patients will provide further insights into the role of SMOC1 in ocular phenotype and coloboma. SMOC-1 and its close homolog SMOC-2 are mammalian paralogs of Drosophila Pentagone, and they function as antagonists of BMP signaling during eye and limb development. The control of digit number and organ size is critically dependent on correct dosage of sonic hedgehog (Shh), BMP4 & BMP7 signaling proteins. The phenotype associated with a null allele in mice and the screening of a cohort of human patients will provide further insights into the role of SMOC1 in ocular phenotype and coloboma.
Type 1 interferons (IFNs) are a crucial part of the innate immune system's response to viruses. They induce an antiviral state in cells that prevents further viral spread. IFNs have been shown to block both early and late stages of the HIV-1 lifecycle. A study by Schneider et al. focused on the effect of IFNs on HIV replication and identified TRIM22 as a key mediator. TRIM22 is one of the most strongly up-regulated genes when human cells are treated with IFN. Over-expression of TRIM22 inhibits HIV replication and when expressed under natural inducing conditions, it acts as a natural antiviral effector. Further studies showed that TRIM22 inhibits budding of virus-like particles containing HIV Gag only and disrupts proper trafficking of HIV Gag leading to diffuse cytoplasmic staining rather than accumulation at the plasma membrane. Mutational analyses of TRIM22 showed that the catalytic amino acids Cys15 and Cys18 of the RING domain are required for TRIM22 antiviral activity. These data reveal a pathway by which Type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication through TRIM22.
Mutualisms, or interspecific interactions where both players benefit, are difficult to explain because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. A study of monoecious figs (Ficus) and their host-specific wasps (Agaonidae) provides insight into the mechanism preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules, thereby maintaining mutualism stability. Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium, but wasps avoid or are prevented from ovipositing into outer ovules, resulting in a segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. In Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. The risk of parasitism decreases towards the center of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. The resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules and reduces their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defenses against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules. These findings provide a new perspective on the mechanisms maintaining mutualism stability and highlight the complexity of interspecific interactions.
A study was conducted using an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to understand the genetic architecture of plant height and its interaction with developmental queues, water availability, and planting density. Plant height was found to be affected by water limitation, high density planting, and growth environment, with a heritability of 62.4%. The study identified 37 QTL associated with plant height throughout development, which accounted for 62.4% of the total variance in plant height. The analysis of ortholog positions suggested that known height affecting genes from the Poaceae account for only a fraction of the loci identified. The study suggests a strategy for the fine scale manipulation of plant height in the Poaceae and provides insights into the dynamic genetic architecture of this complex trait.
The Brazilian Pantanal, a wetland area of approximately 140,000 km2, is home to a diverse range of wildlife species and hematophagous arthropods, making it a breeding ground for zoonotic arboviruses. A recent study from the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal reported serological evidence of various flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Ilheus virus (ILHV), in horses. To further investigate, a study was conducted to collect mosquitoes in the same sub-region during 2009 and 2010. A total of 3,234 adult mosquitoes of 16 species were collected and tested for infectious virus and flavivirus RNA detection. One pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes scapularis tested positive for ILHV by culture and for ILHV RNA by real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full-length genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to the only full genome sequence available for ILHV. This confirms the circulation of ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal.Ilheus virus, first described in 1944, is a flavivirus primarily transmitted between birds and mosquitoes and has been isolated in Central and South America. It causes mainly asymptomatic infections in humans with rare reports of encephalitis. Human infection has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil. In the 1990s, a serological investigation conducted among equines from the Pantanal region of west-central Brazil found neutralizing antibodies to ILHV, suggesting its circulation in the region. A serosurvey conducted in the same area among equines from the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Pantanal in 2009 detected evidence of past infection with ILHV, in increasing order of seroprevalence, among other flaviviruses.The recent discovery of ILHV in mosquitoes in the Pantanal region highlights the potential public health concerns associated with this virus. Further investigation is needed to better understand the prevalence and transmission dynamics of ILHV in the region. It is crucial to monitor the spread of ILHV and the potential impact on human health. The Brazilian arbovirus surveillance program and local physicians should take necessary actions to investigate and control the spread of ILHV in the region.
Scabies is a common, neglected global health burden, with an estimated 100-130 million cases per year and a growing prevalence. Current treatments, including topical agents and oral ivermectin (IVM), are insufficient and drug resistance is emerging. A study in a porcine scabies model compared the efficacy of moxidectin (MOX) and IVM. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive either MOX (0.3 mg/kg once), IVM (0.2 mg/kg twice), or no treatment. Treatment efficacies were evaluated by assessing mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies reductions. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. At day 14 post-treatment, all four MOX-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IVM-treated pigs were mite-free. MOX was 100% effective, and remained unchanged until study-end, compared to 62% (range 26--100%) for IVM. MOX persisted ~9 times longer than IVM in plasma and skin, covering the mite’s entire life cycle. The study demonstrates that oral single-dose MOX may be a more effective alternative than two consecutive IVM-doses for scabies treatment. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy and dose selection of MOX in humans.
The bacterial cell wall is mainly composed of peptidoglycan (PG), whose synthesis is carried out by a molecular machine consisting of multiple proteins, including penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs catalyze the synthesis of glycan strands and their cross-linking via peptides. In Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen with a low number of PG synthesis proteins, seven of the nine genes encoding PG synthesis enzymes were deleted without affecting normal growth or cell morphology, resulting in a strain capable of PG biosynthesis catalyzed only by PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. However, multiple PBPs are important in clinically relevant environments as bacteria with a minimal PG synthesis machinery became highly susceptible to cell wall-targeting antibiotics, host lytic enzymes, and displayed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model. The fact that S. aureus can grow and divide with only two active PG synthesizing enzymes shows that most of these enzymes are redundant in vitro. However, the expendable PG synthesis enzymes play an important role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus in environments other than in vitro growth.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterial pathogen that typically resides in soil and water, can infect most mammals and cause melioidosis, a serious disease with high fatality rates even with rapid diagnosis and aggressive treatment. The bacterium's pathogenesis and iron-acquisition systems are not well understood, but it's known that iron is essential for its growth and that it produces a hydroxamate-type siderophore, malleobactin, for iron acquisition. A clinical isolate (708a) lacking the malleobactin biosynthetic gene cluster still caused human melioidosis, which suggested other iron acquisition systems may contribute to its virulence. Researchers deleted major siderophore and hemin uptake loci in B. pseudomallei strain 1710b and discovered a residual siderophore activity, Hmu-dependent hemin and hemoglobin utilization, and a ferritin-iron acquisition pathway. These findings suggest B. pseudomallei may employ novel iron-acquisition strategies to sustain in vivo growth, which could be potential targets for melioidosis treatment.
COMMGEN is a tool for generating consensus metabolic models for organisms by integrating distinct GSMs (Genome-scale Metabolic Models). It automatically identifies inconsistencies between concurrent models and semi-automatically resolves them, increasing the coherence of knowledge representation and the predictive capabilities of the generated consensus models. This tool is particularly useful for complex scenarios such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions, where manual curation is not feasible. COMMGEN uses a software architecture that operates on GSMs in SBML format, converting IGSMs into a common chemical naming system and combining all reactions into a Basic Consensus Model (BCM) for identifying and resolving inconsistencies. COMMGEN's methods resolve inconsistencies by reconciling metabolites, reactions, and compartments, resulting in a Refined Consensus Model (RCM) that retains or improves on the initial GSMs' predictive capabilities. COMMGEN differs from existing methods by addressing a larger subset of problems in consensus model generation, identifying and curating cases where two initial GSMs represent the same metabolic process at different levels of granularity, and providing a more comprehensive representation of the organisms' metabolic networks.
In this study, researchers used zebrafish as a model organism to investigate the role of proteoglycans (PGs) in the regulation of interactions between chondrocytes and the perichondrium during skeletal development. PGs are important components of the extracellular matrix that play a role in the developmental transition of chondrocytes, known as maturation, during which they express the gene ihh to induce bone in the overlying tissue, the perichondrium. The researchers isolated a class of mutants with decreased cartilage matrix and increased perichondral bone, and found that these mutants had lesions in two genes, fam20b and xylosyltransferase1 (xylt1), which are involved in PG synthesis. Mutants failed to produce wild-type levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs and initiated perichondral bone formation earlier than their wild-type siblings. These findings suggest that PGs play a critical role in regulating the timing of skeletal development by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation, and that mutations in PG synthesis can lead to skeletal abnormalities. Additionally, the study found that mutations in HSPG synthesis delay endochondral ossification, while mutations in chondroitin sulfate PG (CSPG) synthesis may accelerate this bone-forming process, indicating that the class of PG may affect the timing of skeletal development differently. The researchers also discovered that the mutations within fam20b caused the b1125 and b1127 phenotypes and that mutations in xylt1 caused the b1128 and b1189 phenotypes. Overall, this study highlights the importance of PGs in regulating skeletal development and the potential consequences of mutations in PG synthesis.
The Top2 RNAi-expressing line, which decreases Top2 levels in the female germline of Drosophila melanogaster, was used to examine the effect of decreased Top2 levels starting at approximately stage 3 of the ovary during mid-prophase. Results showed that achiasmate chromosomes fail to separate from the main chromosome mass, and abnormal DNA projections emanating from that mass toward the pole are often observed. Centromere-led movements of the chromosomes towards the spindles poles are the cause of the DNA projections, and these movements suggest that centromeres of chiasmate chromosomes are also moving toward the poles in some Top2 RNAi/matαGAL oocytes. These results demonstrate that decreased Top2 levels generally affect the movement and organization of centromeres within the chromosome mass. The DNA protrusions are caused by the centromeres of both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes being pulled or pushed towards the spindle poles while other parts of the chromosomes are still anchored at the center of the spindle. Despite the abnormal DNA projections, chromosomes in Top2 RNAi/matαGAL oocytes are able to organize a bipolar spindle, though tapering of both ends of the spindle is only seen in 57.7% of oocytes. The ability of Top2 RNAi/matαGAL oocytes to organize a bipolar spindle is further illustrated by live imaging. The data suggest that the projections are composed of heterochromatic sequences and that the failure of heterochromatic regions to properly orient is the likely cause of the projections. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of chromosome separation and the role of Top2 in meiosis.
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars in dogs as a public health measure to control and prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in two endemic areas in Brazil. The intervention area involved the use of collars on seronegative dogs, while the control area only employed conventional CVL control measures. The study found that the seroprevalence of CVL decreased in both areas, but the reduction was significantly greater in the intervention area (6.0%) compared to the control area (11.0%). This indicated protection against CVL in the intervention area. However, the incidence of CVL did not differ significantly between the areas, although there was an increased tendency in the control area. The use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars likely provides protection over time, but the strategy presents operational challenges for local zoonosis control authorities, indicating the need for improved collar design. CVL is a serious public health problem caused by Leishmania infantum and transmitted to humans and other mammals by sand flies. Dogs are the main urban reservoir of L. infantum, making them a crucial target in VL control strategies. Current control measures have limitations, and studies have shown that they are insufficient to control human and canine VL, highlighting the need to implement new intervention strategies. The use of collars impregnated with 4% deltamethrin has been found to be a promising strategy for individual protection of dogs against phlebotomine bites. However, few field studies have evaluated the efficacy of these collars in controlling the disease transmission cycle. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of community-wide implementation of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in a highly endemic area of CVL and compare the results with those obtained in a control area where only the euthanasia of seropositive dogs was performed.
The X chromosome is unusual in many ways, including its nonrandom gene content. This bias is thought to be caused by sexual antagonism, the avoidance of activity in the male germline, and limits imposed on gene expression due to haploid expression of the X chromosome. If the X is transcribed at rates comparable to the ancestral rate per promoter prior to X chromosome formation, then the X is not a tolerable environment for genes with very high maximal net levels of expression due to transcriptional traffic jams. This is because the X chromosome has a lower maximal expression of human X-linked genes compared to autosomes, with an average of three times lower maximal expression on the X chromosome. Additionally, autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal ones if highly expressed but not if lowly expressed. The traffic jam model also explains the known lower breadth of expression for genes on the X and the Z of birds, as genes with broad expression are, on average, those with high maximal expression. Overall, the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed due to transcriptional traffic jams provides a simple and robust explanation for many peculiar features of X’s gene content, gene expression, and evolution.
Anatomically modern humans and the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori both originated in Africa and have been associated for at least 100,000 years. There are seven geographically distinct H. pylori populations, three of which are indigenous to Africa: hpAfrica1, hpAfrica2, and hpNEAfrica. The oldest and most divergent population, hpAfrica2, evolved within San hunter-gatherers. Researchers investigated the prevalence and population structure of H. pylori within Baka Pygmies in Cameroon and found a significantly lower infection rate (20.8%) compared to non-Baka (80.2%). Most isolates were assigned to hpNEAfrica or hpAfrica1. The low H. pylori prevalence among Baka Pygmies is achievable within a few hundred years due to demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy. The Baka probably acquired their extant H. pylori through secondary contact with their agriculturalist neighbors. H. pylori is a major gastric pathogen that infects more than half the world's human population and can result in gastric inflammation, ulcers, gastric cancer, and MALT lymphoma. Transmission within families plays a dominant role in areas with better sanitary conditions, but extra-familial horizontal transmission is typical in rural areas of the developing world. The association of H. pylori with humans is ancient, dating back at least 100,000 years. Africa is the ancestral home of humans and H. pylori, and three distinct African populations have been identified within this bacterial species. Infected anatomically modern humans carried H. pylori with them when they left Africa about 60,000 years ago, and diverse demographic and selective pressures subsequently resulted in four additional, geographically-associated populations in Eurasia, Sahul, and the Americas.
Dengue virus (DENV) NS5, the most conserved among the viral non-structural proteins, plays a crucial role in capping, methylation, and replication of the flavivirus RNA genome. It also interacts with host proteins to modify host immune responses. While replication typically occurs in the cytoplasm, DENV2 NS5 localizes to the nucleus during infection without a clear role in replication or pathogenesis. A study examining NS5 of DENV1 and 2, which show the most prominent difference in nuclear localization, found that the C-terminal 18 residues (Cter18) alone are sufficient to direct the protein to the cytoplasm or nucleus. The low micromolar binding affinity between NS5 Cter18 and the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha allows for the formation of a molecular complex critical for NS5 subcellular localization. Specifically, the trans conformation adopted by Pro-884 allows proper presentation for binding Impα, and mutating this proline to Thr, as present in DENV1 NS5, results in mislocalization of NS5 to the cytoplasm. A single mutation to alanine at NS5 position R888, a residue conserved in all flaviviruses, results in a completely non-viable virus, while the R888K mutation leads to a severely attenuated phenotype. This suggests an evolutionarily conserved function for NS5 Cter18, possibly in RNA interactions that are critical for replication, that is independent of its role in subcellular localization. DENV is a prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease, affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite the existence of a partially effective tetravalent vaccine, there are no antiviral drugs to prevent or treat dengue infection. Classical vector control strategies and molecular vector control approaches remain the cornerstone in preventing transmission. The DENV single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome contains a single open reading frame that encodes three structural and seven nonstructural proteins, among which NS5 is the largest and most conserved. It contains methyltransferase and putative guanylyltransferase activities at its N-terminal region and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity at its C-terminal region. In infected cells, NS5 works in concert with NS3 to participate in type 1 cap formation and viral RNA replication. NS5 has also been shown to modulate the host immune response and induce the expression and secretion of DHF-associated immunomediators, IL-6 and IL-8.
The Innovative Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM) methodology is an integrated mapping protocol developed for four neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) - lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths. The ITM protocol aims to determine whether a threshold for public health intervention has been attained in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner. It is designed to be an alternative to the current WHO mapping methodologies for each of the targeted diseases, and it has been tested and compared in one district each in Mali and Senegal. The ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminths, but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM methodology was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-effective, demonstrating an overall cost saving compared with the standard, non-integrated, WHO methodologies. This integrated mapping tool could facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries.NTDs are a group of parasitic and bacterial diseases affecting over 2.7 billion people, causing significant physical debilitation, lowered economic productivity, and social ostracism. Five NTDs with available preventive chemotherapy have been targeted for control or elimination, but resource constraints in endemic countries have impeded progress towards these goals. Integration of program components has the potential to cut the costs of NTD programs. Before an MDA can be launched, a country must demonstrate that the disease threshold for public health intervention has been surpassed, which requires reviewing available data and collecting missing data by conducting prevalence surveys. The ITM methodology aims to balance epidemiologic rigor and field practicality in determining whether a disease has attained the threshold for public health intervention.In the study, the ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminths but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM methodology was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-effective, demonstrating an overall cost saving compared with the standard, non-integrated, WHO methodologies. The integrated mapping tool could facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc14, a conserved phosphatase, is necessary for exiting mitosis and is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by the Cfi1/Net1 protein until early anaphase. Two redundant pathways, FEAR (Cdc fourteen early release) and MEN (mitotic exit network), promote Cdc14 release. A study found that histone H2B ubiquitination by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase plays a novel role in the cell cycle-dependent release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin when the MEN is inactive. This function is mediated by activating histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 but does not depend on the Sir2 HDAC associated with Cdc14 on nucleolar chromatin. Additionally, cells lacking H3 lysine 36 methylation and an HDAC recruited by this modification have a defect in Cdc14 release. These histone modifications represent previously unappreciated factors required for the accessibility to and/or action on nucleolar chromatin of FEAR network components, contrasting with the notion of a highly combinatorial code by which histone marks act to control biological processes. The FEAR network, in conjunction with the MEN, controls the release of Cdc14. Work in S. cerevisiae has elucidated the two pathways that control the release of Cdc14, the FEAR network and the MEN. The MEN is a signaling cascade controlled by the GTPase Tem1 and its upstream regulators, while the FEAR network is a set of genes that, when mutated in combination with mutations in the MEN, are unable to release Cdc14 from the nucleolus. Genetic epistasis experiments separate FEAR network components into two pathways, one regulated by a non-proteolytic function of Esp1 and the other by the nucleolar protein Spo12. The Polo-like kinase Cdc5 regulates both pathways by inhibiting the Bub2/Bfa1 complex and being required for FEAR network-mediated Cdc14 release. Cdc14 is sequestered on rDNA chromatin specifically at the RFB along with the other members of the RENT complex and Fob1, leading to speculation on whether the regulation for these other activities at rDNA overlaps with the regulation of Cdc14 release. Recent studies have revealed a role for histone modifications in regulating rDNA functions, including the methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 4 and 79 by the methyltransferases Set1 and Dot1 for robust rDNA silencing. These modifications require the presence of monoubiquitination on Lysine 123 of histone H2B and are dependent on the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Rad6 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Bre1.
"GeneProgram is a new unsupervised computational framework that addresses the challenges of identifying expression programs in human gene expression data compendia. These challenges include cellular inhomogeneity within samples, genetic and environmental variation across samples, uncertainty in the numbers of programs and sample populations, and temporal behavior. GeneProgram uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior, and it produces maps of expression programs sorted by generality scores that exploit the automatically learned groupings. It outperformed several popular expression analysis methods in synthetic and real gene expression data. When applied to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules, GeneProgram produced a map of 104 expression programs, a substantial number of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors in genome-wide experiments. The method is multipurpose and can be applied to novel compendia of biological data. The discovered map of expression programs involved in the response to infection will be useful for guiding future biological experiments, and the genes from programs with low generality scores may serve as new drug targets that exhibit minimal ""cross-talk,"" while genes from high generality programs may maintain common physiological responses that go awry in disease states."
The study focuses on the role of Memory Type 1 T Helper (TH1) cells and NK cells in expressing interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in response to infections caused by intracellular pathogens. TH1 cells express IFN-γ after undergoing a differentiation process and epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus, while NK cells express IFN-γ at early maturation stages. NK cells with memory-like properties have been observed during cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Human CMV (HCMV) infection shapes the human NK cell repertoire, leading to higher frequencies of CD94/NKG2C+ NK cells in HCMV seropositive individuals. These cells can be expanded in vitro in the presence of HCMV-infected fibroblasts and undergo extensive proliferation in vivo during HCMV reactivation after solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation. NKG2C recognizes the non-classical HLA class I molecule HLA-E, whose surface expression is stabilized by peptides derived from the leader sequence of other HLA class I molecules. HCMV exploits strategies to induce down-regulation of MHC class I molecules in infected cells, including blocking TAP and inducing surface expression of HLA-E. The study shows that only HCMV-specific NKG2Chi expansions and cytokine-primed NK cells share the ability to undergo remodeling of the CNS1 with TH1 cells. The open configuration of the CNS1 in NKG2Chi NK cell expansions is stably imprinted and occurs exclusively in donors displaying a distinctive expansion of NKG2Chi sKIR+ NK cells. The study suggests that CNS1 demethylation in NKG2Chi expansions from HCMV+ individuals is part of a broader epigenetic remodeling, which is partially shared by TH1 and memory CD8+ T cells. NKG2Chi NK cells are potent IFN-γ producers, but they respond less efficiently to IL-12+IL-18 stimulation and several activating receptors due to the lower expression of IL12RB2 and IL-18R and down-regulation of several actR. NKG2C engagement alone or in combination with 2B4 represents a major trigger of IFN-γ production in NKG2Chi NK cells. Overall, the study provides insights into the molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells and shows that epigenetic remodeling of the CNS1 region in the IFNG locus is a hallmark of NKG2Chi NK cells expanded in HCMV+ individuals and cytokine-primed NK cells.
Legionella pneumophila, a gram-negative bacterium found in freshwater environments, causes a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease in humans. Upon phagocytosis by eukaryotic cells, L. pneumophila remodels the Legionella-containing phagosome to form a compartment that allows its intracellular replication. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system, an essential virulence determinant, translocates L. pneumophila effector proteins into host cells during infection. These effector proteins control host cell functions to initiate trafficking of the L. pneumophila vacuole, promote host cell survival, modulate innate immune responses, and promote bacterial egress. Ubiquitin is a small peptide present in all eukaryotes and plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination of substrate proteins, leading to their degradation by the proteasome. L. pneumophila encodes one U-box protein (LubX) and several F-box-containing proteins. LubX functions as a U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase and mediates polyubiquitination of a host kinase Clk1, but its consequence remains unknown. The expression and translocation of LubX is induced upon infection and the levels of LubX within host cells come to maximum at later stages of infection. Surprisingly, analyses of these effector proteins led to the identification of SidH as a target of LubX. LubX acts as a negative temporal regulator of SidH within host cells. This is the first example of the bacterial effector that targets and regulates a cognate effector within the host cells, and we propose the designation “metaeffector” for this class of bacterial effectors. In summary, L. pneumophila uses sophisticated mechanisms such as ubiquitination and effector-regulating mechanisms to coordinate the function of a large array of effector proteins with diverse activities during infection.
The study investigates the diversification of HIV-1 env coding sequences in 81 early B subtype infections, which resulted from transmission or expansion of single viruses or two closely related viruses. The analysis found evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and identified a subset of codon sites that diversified more rapidly than can be explained by a model of neutral evolution. Of these rapidly diversifying sites, 14 were either in CTL epitopes or in a nucleotide context indicative of APOBEC-mediated G-to-A substitutions. The study also found that the length variation seen in hypervariable loop regions of the envelope glycoprotein is a consequence of selection and not of mutational hotspots. These results provide a detailed view of the process of diversification of HIV-1 following transmission and highlight the role of CTL escape and hypermutation in shaping viral evolution during the establishment of new infections. The adaptation of HIV-1 to new hosts, in particular to the initial immune response, is likely to influence the establishment and progression of HIV infection. The early evolution of the HIV-1 envelope gene is of particular interest because Env plays a vital role in transmission, is an early target of immune responses, and a key determinant of target cell tropism. The development of vaccines capable of eliciting antibodies against Env that can block viral entry is complicated by the vast sequence variability between viruses, escape variants, and the large number of N-linked glycans in gp120 that provide the virus with a protective coat.
The authors present a minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast, focusing on the roles of H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation. They find that having both modifications is important for the robustness of epigenetic silencing, and that certain perturbations can lead to a novel bivalent state with both active and silencing marks. The model is used to investigate the design principles of the silencing system and to assess diverse experimental observations within a single theoretical framework. The authors also discuss the behavior of Sir protein recruitment, spreading, and stability of silenced regions in commonly-studied mutants, providing a comprehensive review of the molecular biology of yeast silencing and its central puzzles. The model considers five possible nucleosome-states, including Sir-complex-bound, acetylated histone, methylated state, unmodified state, and transcriptionally active state. The model exhibits bistability between the silenced state and the intermediate state, and the bivalent state is monostable. The study of the four dimensional phase space reveals that only four distinct stable epigenetic fates emerge in all of phase space, and that the supply of Sir proteins plays a crucial role in determining the silencing fate of the chromatin loci. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of various chromatin modifications and their roles in regulating transcriptional activity in budding yeast.
Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) among children remains a significant health issue in many developing countries, with moderate and severe acute malnutrition accounting for 12.6% of total deaths of children under 5 years of age. SAM can manifest as oedematous or non-oedematous malnutrition, with oedematous malnutrition being the most severe form, also known as kwashiorkor. Although the pathogenesis of both types of malnutrition in children is largely unknown, recent studies suggest a link between gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis and oedematous malnutrition. In this study, the researchers aimed to assess whether GM composition differed between Ugandan children suffering from either oedematous or non-oedematous malnutrition.The study included 87 SAM children aged 6-24 months, with 62% suffering from oedematous malnutrition, 66% were boys, and the mean age was 16.1 months. The results showed that GM composition differed between the two groups of children as determined by DGGE (p = 0.0317) and by high-throughput sequencing, with non-oedematous children having lower GM alpha diversity (p = 0.036). However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal larger differences between the GM of children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. Therefore, the study indicates that non-oedematous SAM children have lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children, but no clear compositional differences were identified. This suggests that low diversity per se, rather than the presence or absence of specific GM members, is associated with non-oedematous SAM. Further research is required to establish a causal relationship between gut microbiota and SAM and to explore better therapeutic strategies.
In this study, the variability in telomere length was examined in Saccharomyces isolates, primarily focusing on S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. The research found that S. paradoxus isolates displayed extensive variation in telomere length, which correlated with their geographic origin. European strains had extremely short telomeres, while American isolates had significantly longer telomeres. This variation was attributed to many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in length maintenance. Furthermore, variation in telomere position effect (TPE) was similarly quantitative but weakly correlated with telomere length. Genotyping F1 segregants indicated several QTLs associated with telomere length and silencing variation, including likely candidate genes and regions with no known genes involved in telomeric properties. The study also found transgressive segregation for both phenotypes and validated YKU80 and TLC1 as telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. These findings suggest that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis, resulting in very short telomeres in certain allelic combinations. Overall, this research provides insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying telomere length variation in yeast, which could have implications for understanding telomere biology in other organisms, including humans.
Sequential sampling models (SSMs) have been successful in predicting decision-making and response times (RTs) in various scenarios. However, SSMs typically assume that decisions are triggered by a single event, without considering the possibility of delaying or postponing the choice. In a study using EEG and fMRI, participants performed a stock-buying task where they could freely sample information before making a decision. Standard SSMs failed to accurately predict RT distributions in this task, while an extended model including a decision not to decide significantly improved the fit. The decision not to decide was associated with increased oscillatory power in the beta band, indicative of motor response inhibition. These findings highlight the importance of considering decision postponement in sequential decision-making and the potential of computational modeling to deepen our understanding of cognitive processes.
Hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK) is a monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder found in Labrador Retrievers, characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) and whole genome re-sequencing approach were used to identify the genetic lesion responsible for HNPK. The GWAS revealed a single strong association signal on chromosome 2, and the analysis of shared haplotypes among cases defined a critical interval of 1.6 Mb with 25 predicted genes. Whole genome re-sequencing of an affected dog identified 3 non-synonymous variants in the critical interval. One of these variants, a missense variant (c.972T>G) in the SUV39H2 gene, was perfectly associated with the HNPK phenotype in a cohort of over 500 dogs. This gene encodes a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase, which mediates chromatin silencing. The variant is predicted to change an evolutionary conserved asparagine into a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme. Further studies revealed that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Therefore, SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis.
"In a study, pigs co-housed in groups included influenza-seronegative pigs, those infected with avian H1N1 IAV, and those infected with swine H3N2 IAV. Genomic analysis of 571 isolates from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants. Viruses recovered from lower respiratory tract tissues had the largest genomic diversity and variations in growth kinetics, while those from turbinates and nasal wash fluids had the least. One reassortant in nasal wash samples was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tract tissues and confirmed to be transmitted efficiently between pigs. The findings suggest that during mixed infections of avian and swine IAVs, genetic reassortments are likely to occur in the lower respiratory track, and tissue tropism is an essential factor selecting for a transmissible reassortant. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are negative-strand RNA viruses with eight gene segments of various lengths and can cause infections in various animals, including birds and mammals. Wild birds, particularly those living in wetlands and aquatic environments, serve as the major natural IAV reservoir. Pigs have both avian-like and human-like receptors on the epithelial cells of their respiratory tissues, making them an intermediate host ""mixing vessel"" for generating pandemic IAV strains through genetic reassortment between avian and swine or human IAVs. However, emergence of these pandemic viruses is complicated and could require multiple reassortment events, mutations, and compatibility between the co-circulating avian and swine or human IAVs. Tissue tropism is an essential factor in selecting transmissible reassortants from various reassortants generated in pigs co-infected with avian and swine IAVs."
In a study of children in Uganda, praziquantel treatment of Schistosoma mansoni during pregnancy had no effect on the prevalence or immune responses of the children to S. mansoni at age five, with the exception of IL-10 responses to SWA, which were higher in offspring of women treated with praziquantel during pregnancy. This suggests that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. In communities where schistosomiasis is endemic, an age-dependent build-up of immune response and resistance to S. mansoni infection is observed, and in-utero sensitisation to schistosome antigens might influence early childhood responses and resistance to infection. Additionally, children who are exposed in-utero, but do not become sensitised, may have acquired tolerance to schistosome antigens, which might render them more susceptible to infection. In-utero sensitisation to schistosome antigens might also influence schistosomiasis morbidity, as early or in-utero sensitisation can modulate the immune response and subsequent pathology associated with S. mansoni infection. A balanced type one/type two immune response is needed to limit morbidity in schistosomiasis, and responses established in-utero could influence this balance. The study followed offspring of women in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of praziquantel versus matching placebo and albendazole versus matching placebo during pregnancy. The women provided stool samples that were examined for intestinal helminths including S. mansoni infection. Children were followed up annually and stool and blood samples were collected at each visit. For the current study, the researchers focused on offspring of the study women at age five years. The stool samples were examined for helminth infections including S. mansoni by the Kato Katz method for all children, and blood samples were processed for immune responses, plasma was separated and stored at −80°C, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen. Whole blood culture for responses to schistosome antigens, and anti-schistosome antibody assays, were performed in a subgroup of 436 children. The levels of endotoxin in the antigen preparations were negligible and unlikely to influence cytokine responses in whole blood culture. Cytokine levels in unstimulated cultures were generally low and cytokine concentrations in unstimulated wells were subtracted from the measured concentrations in antigen-stimulated wells. Plasma levels of IgG1, IgG4 and IgE to SWA and SEA were measured in duplicate by ELISA with a high through-put semi-automated system. The study found that children of women treated with praziquantel during pregnancy had higher IL-10 responses to SWA than those who did not, suggesting that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis.
Following an infectious challenge, macrophages are key players in clearance of pathogens, mainly through receptor-mediated phagocytosis. However, certain conditions such as mycobacterial infections can evade this process, leading to survival within macrophages. As an alternative to receptor-mediated phagocytosis, macrophages can internalize material via macropinocytosis, which allows the internalization of large amounts of cargo independent of any receptor usage. A study described inflammatory stimuli as a switch for the macrophage endocytic pathway from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis. This switch occurs through protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which relocates from the cell cortex to cytoplasmic puncta and activates phosphoinositol-3-kinase activity, essential for macropinocytic uptake. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that activated coronin 1 was sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli, suggesting a novel mechanism to regulate the internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of macropinocytosis in inflammation-induced clearance of pathogens, a process that could be targeted in therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases.
In West Nile, Uganda, there are renewed efforts to eliminate neglected tropical diseases, including sleeping sickness, through more cost-effective tsetse control methods. A study was conducted in Arua District to assess community knowledge, perceptions, and acceptance of tsetse baits in villages with and without previous exposure to tsetse control programs. The study found that community perceptions of deployed baits varied significantly between neighboring villages, depending on their duration of experience with tsetse control programs. In villages new to such interventions, negative perceptions, fear, and anxiety related to witchcraft and ghosts were reported. Conversely, in villages with previous exposure, community members had positive attitudes and understood the benefits of tsetse control interventions. To ensure the success of community-based interventions against tsetse, early engagement and carefully designed sensitization campaigns are crucial, especially in communities new to these interventions.Tsetse control plays a significant role in the global effort to eliminate sleeping sickness by 2020. With the advancement in tsetse control technology, making it more cost-effective, easier to deploy, and maintain, large-scale HAT control operations become increasingly attractive. However, community participation is essential for the success of such programs. Lack of sustained government funding, collaboration between provider and beneficiary, and adequate sensitization of communities can hinder the implementation of large-scale vector control operations. Factors like community acceptance of traps, involvement in construction, deployment, and maintenance are vital for the success of tsetse control programs. Negative attitudes and associations with indigenous beliefs might lead to resistance, theft, and vandalism of traps, ultimately causing operational failure.In summary, understanding community perceptions and participation is crucial for the success of large-scale tsetse control programs aimed at eliminating neglected tropical diseases like sleeping sickness. Addressing concerns, involving communities in the process, and designing sensitization campaigns tailored to specific communities can significantly improve the acceptance and success of such interventions.
Recombination is a fundamental biological process with significant evolutionary implications, as it increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations. However, quantifying its impact has been challenging due to a lack of detailed characterization of recombination rate variation across genomes and within species. This study reports the first high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination for Drosophila melanogaster, differentiating between the two outcomes of meiotic recombination: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). Researchers characterized the products of 5,860 female meioses by genotyping a total of 139 million informative SNPs and mapped 106,964 recombination events at a resolution down to 2 kilobases. This analysis allowed for the generation of whole-genome CO and GC maps as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species.The study identified extreme variation and punctuated patterns in CO rates along chromosomes, with hot and coldspots, and extensive intra-specific variation in CO landscapes associated with hotspots at low frequency in the sample. GC rates were more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. Recombination events were found to be associated with numerous sequence motifs and primarily occurred within transcript regions, suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. This detailed characterization of recombination rate variation and its multi-layered variation across genomes and among individuals will improve estimates of recombination rates and inform a new generation of population genetic models of the interaction between selection and linkage.
IDN2, a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana, interacts with two paralogs IDP1 and IDP2. The XH domain of IDN2 is required for this interaction and is critical for IDN2 function in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing. IDP1 and IDP2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting they have distinct roles in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex. This complex likely facilitates the recruitment of double-stranded RNA-containing effector complexes to specific chromatin regions at a downstream step of the RdDM pathway. IDN2 is capable of interacting with its paralogs IDP1 and IDP2 in vivo and forms a 400-KDa protein complex. IDN2 is most similar to At3g12550 and At4g01780, while IDP1 (AT1G15910) and IDP2 (AT4g00380) are highly similar to each other and exist in another clade of the family. However, IDP1 and IDP2 but not At3g12550 or At4g01780 were co-purified by affinity purification of IDN2. IDP1 is required for siRNA accumulation, de novo DNA methylation, and transcriptional gene silencing, whereas IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1.
Neutrophils are crucial in the body's defense against various pathogens, including Leishmania braziliensis. They are the first line of defense and are rapidly recruited to the site of Leishmania inoculation. Depletion of inflammatory cells during Leishmania braziliensis infection increases the parasite load, while co-inoculation of neutrophils with L. braziliensis has the opposite effect. In vitro, exposure of neutrophils to L. braziliensis modulates the expression of surface molecules, induces the oxidative burst, and releases inflammatory mediators. This response is mainly observed in infected and not bystander cells. In vivo inoculation of serum-opsonized L. braziliensis promastigotes in mice induces neutrophil accumulation, peaking at 24 hours. These findings suggest that L. braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment and activates them, which may impact parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection. Neutrophils are essential components of the early inflammatory response and play distinct roles during Leishmania infection depending on the combination of mouse strain and parasite species. They can contribute to parasite killing or enhance disease in resistant or susceptible mice. Following phagocytosis, some Leishmania spp can be found within non-lytic compartments, exploiting neutrophils as to gain access to macrophages where infection is established. In vivo, neutrophils readily arrive at the site of L. major and L. infantum-chagasi inoculation within minutes and capture L. major parasites at the site of sand fly bite. The absence of neutrophils is unfavorable to infection. Therefore, understanding the interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis is crucial in developing effective strategies for the treatment and prevention of Leishmaniasis.
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a significant problem for farmers, with costs associated with testing and restrictions on animal movements. Current diagnostic tests for bTB, such as the tuberculin skin test, cannot differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals, which has been a barrier to the use of vaccination as part of control programs. However, new diagnostic tests called DIVA (Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals) have the potential to allow for the use of vaccination in existing eradication programs.Using within-herd transmission models estimated from historical data from Great Britain, researchers explored the feasibility of supplemental use of vaccination within existing bTB eradication programs. The economic impact of bTB for farmers is largely due to the costs associated with testing and restrictions on animal movements. Farmers' willingness to adopt vaccination will require vaccination to not only reduce the burden of infection but also the risk of restrictions being imposed. The research found that, under the intensive sequence of testing in GB, it is the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than the sensitivity, that is the greatest barrier to seeing a herd level benefit of vaccination. The potential negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated through relaxation of testing, but this could potentially increase the hidden burden of infection within Officially TB Free herds.The study estimates that a DIVA specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective benefit of vaccination with no increase in the risk of missed infection. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest that this target specificity could be achieved in vaccinates using a cocktail of three DIVA antigens while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% (95%CI: 61.9, 82.9%) relative to post-mortem detection. Human vaccine Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been shown to induce significant levels of protection in cattle. However, vaccination is not currently used as part of a national bTB control program due to the interference of BCG with the specificity of the tuberculin skin test. A new generation of diagnostic DIVA tests that can differentiate vaccinated from infected animals has the potential to allow for the use of BCG within current control programs.In summary, the use of vaccination in conjunction with new DIVA diagnostic tests has the potential to improve the control of bTB in cattle, but the specificity of the DIVA test is a key factor in realizing the benefits of vaccination. Further research is needed to optimize the use of these new tools in bTB control programs.
Trichuris trichiura, a human whipworm, infects around 500 million people globally, leading to physical growth and educational performance issues, particularly in children. Current drug treatment options are limited and lack efficacy against the worm, making the development of new treatments crucial. Using Trichuris muris as a model for T. trichiura, researchers screened a library of 480 novel drug-like small molecules and identified a class of dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-one compounds with anthelmintic activity against T. muris. Further screening and resynthesis of the most potent molecules led to the identification of 20 active dihydrobenzoxazepinones, a class of molecule not previously implicated in nematode control. These compounds immobilize adult T. muris with EC50 values around 25–50μM, comparable to the existing anthelmintic levamisole. The best compounds from this chemotype show low cytotoxicity against murine gut epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. Developing a novel oral pharmaceutical treatment for a neglected disease like trichuriasis and deploying it via mass drug administration is challenging. However, the dihydrobenzoxazepinones also reduce the ability of embryonated T. muris eggs to establish infection in the mouse host in vivo, supporting an alternative strategy of developing a therapeutic that acts in the environment, perhaps via a spray, to interrupt the parasite lifecycle. These results highlight the potential of dihydrobenzoxazepinones as a new class of anthelmintic, active against both egg and adult stages of Trichuris parasites, with encouraging selectivity for the parasite and potential for further optimization to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties for developing a clinical agent.
"The idea of ""date"" and ""party"" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks has been influential in the study of network connectivity, with date hubs displaying low co-expression with partners and party hubs showing high co-expression. However, it has been shown that the importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of them, and these hubs do not display particularly low expression correlation. The distribution of hubs is not always bimodal, as previously thought, and topological properties of hubs do not correlate with co-expression. Despite this, interaction centrality has been found to correlate with the functional similarity of interacting proteins. Protein interaction networks do not capture the fact that actual interactions depend on physiological conditions, and the use of mRNA expression data can help incorporate this information. The date/party hub distinction has been debated and the hypothesis has been prominent in the literature, but the validity of the distinction remains unclear. It is suggested that thinking in terms of a date/party dichotomy for hubs in protein interaction networks is not meaningful, and it might be more useful to conceive of roles for protein-protein interactions rather than for individual proteins. Further research is needed to understand the organization of the interactome."
The development of methodologies for reconstructing transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks from densely sampled whole genome sequence data has been ongoing in recent years. However, a key limitation of these approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales, meaning that the position of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have occurred between the sampled pathogen genomes. The authors of this study introduce the concept of ‘transmission divergence’ to quantify and compare the useful genetic diversity expected from genetic data in different pathogen outbreaks. Transmission divergence is defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. The study simulates outbreak scenarios and sequence evolution for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens using two models of sequence evolution to describe transmission divergence. They find that while the mean transmission divergence varies significantly between the pathogens considered, it is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. The authors demonstrate that genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, while sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence provide little to no information about individual transmission events. The study highlights the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios and the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.
X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences most genes on one X chromosome in female mammals, but some genes escape XCI. A study analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI and distinguishable alleles. The study found that few genes (3-7%) escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, while an in vitro system showed a higher density of escape genes (21%). Allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase I hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on the Xi correlated well with levels of escape, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes. The study also found that allele-specific CTCF binding on the Xi clustered at escape genes and was denser in brain compared to the Patski cell line, possibly contributing to a more compartmentalized structure of the Xi and fewer escape genes in brain compared to the cell line. Overall, the study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate XCI and the identification of escape genes in vivo.
Plasmodium vivax, a significant human malaria species, causes hundreds of millions of illnesses each year, leading to severe morbility and mortality, particularly in children. The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant vivax malaria are a growing concern, associated with fatal disease. Cysteine proteases of malaria parasites play vital roles in various physiological processes necessary for the parasite's survival. Two cysteine proteases, vivapain (VX) -2 and VX-3, have been identified in P. vivax, but comprehensive studies are hindered by the inability to culture P. vivax. This study describes the biochemical properties of a novel cysteine protease of P. vivax, vivapain-4 (VX-4), exhibiting unusual pH-dependent substrate specificity. Molecular modeling and mutation analysis revealed that Glu180 is involved in the pH-dependent substrate specificity of VX-4. The protease effectively hydrolyzed hemoglobin at acidic pH, actin at neutral pH, and plasmepsin 4 at neutral and acidic pHs, supporting its role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and architectural remodeling of the parasite during growth and development. Further investigation of P. vivax cysteine proteases is essential to understand their biological roles and to characterize targets for antimalarial drugs.
A novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) for the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii has been reconstructed, representing the first ME-model for a Gram-positive bacterium. This model includes all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways as well as pathways for RNA and protein synthesis necessary for catalyzing these reactions. The ME-model significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology, and enables prediction of fermentation profiles, including overflow metabolism products, gene expression, and usage of cofactors and metals. The model accurately predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycerol during changing carbon and metal availability, and revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in this model acetogen. The model was able to predict both batch and nutrient-limited growth conditions, and identified unique growth rate and yield functions for growth with CO, CO2+H2, or fructose. The ME-model was able to recapitulate overflow metabolism by accounting for redox balancing and concurrent proteome limitations, and was able to predict substrate-specific growth rates with high accuracy. The ME-model predicted previously unknown secretion of glycerol following acetate and ethanol production during growth on xylose or glucose. In silico maximum growth rates for individual substrates can be obtained through the ME-model, which predicted slower growth on glucose than for fructose, in contrast to the M-model. Overall, the iJL965-ME model provides a robust, genome-wide approach to define how transition metals affect an organism’s functional network, particularly for acetogens where metals are crucial for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.
Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are using large cohorts of primary cell lines to study a disease of interest and assign biological relevance to genetic signals. This approach is demonstrated using a panel of human osteoblasts (HObs) to perform a transcriptomic survey, similar to previous studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The distinct nature of HObs and LCLs is reflected by the grouping of cell type-specific genes within biologically and functionally relevant pathways unique to each tissue type. A cis-association analysis identified genetic variations of transcript isoforms, with differential expression controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants in both a tissue-specific and tissue-independent fashion. Examination of the top SNPs from a GWAS of bone mineral density revealed overlap with probeset associations observed in this study, with a novel transcript isoform variant identified for the top hit corresponding to the FAM118A gene. This study suggests that multiple transcript isoforms are often present in both tissues, with genetic control affecting the relative expression of one isoform to another. This approach is useful for detecting the proportion of genetic variation common to different cell types and for the identification of cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant.
Saccharomyces eubayanus, a non-S. cerevisiae parent of S. pastorianus lager-brewing hybrid, cannot utilize the maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort. However, S. eubayanus strain CBS 12357T has four SeMALT genes that enable uptake of the alpha-di-glucoside maltose. A study aimed to examine the evolvability of maltotriose utilization in S. eubayanus CBS 123
The variants of human influenza virus have caused and continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality. Current approaches to assess the impact of influenza on human death rely mostly on intensive and unbiased influenza surveillance, but this presents a substantial challenge. A study proposes a novel host-virus interaction model and establishes a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by viral strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each (sub) type of seasonal influenza viruses. Based on this relationship, the study further develops a method to rapidly assess the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between A (H1N1) strains. Rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden for new seasonal strains should help formulate a cost-effective response for influenza control and prevention. Seasonal influenza viruses have been and will continue to be a significant threat to public health. There are three types of seasonal influenza – A, B and C. Among them, influenza H1N1 and H3N2 of type A and type B are currently circulating frequently in the human population. During evolution, many variants of influenza virus with distinct antigenic properties have emerged either by mutation or reassortment of the gene encoding the viral coat protein hemagglutinin (HA). These antigenic variants have caused morbidity and mortality with varying magnitude. If the mortality burden of a newly emerged virus can be estimated accurately and in time, this knowledge will be extremely valuable not only for public preparedness for an impending epidemic/pandemic but also for the health authorities to develop cost-effective control and intervention strategies.
The Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is a significant threat to soybean production, causing severe disease epidemics. The genomes of rust fungi encode many small, secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SSCRP) that are thought to function within the host, but their roles are unknown. This study characterizes PpEC23, a SSCRP of P. pachyrhizi, and shows that it suppresses plant immunity and interacts with a soybean transcription factor, GmSPL12l. Plants with silenced GmSPL12l have constitutively active immunity, identifying it as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. These findings suggest that PpEC23 is able to suppress soybean immune responses and physically interact with a soybean transcription factor that negatively regulates the immune system, providing insights into the mechanisms by which rust pathogens manipulate host immune systems.
Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, invades host cells and replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called inclusion. The bacterium induces a long-lasting activation of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which is required for its efficient replication. The EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) is identified as a chlamydial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3K activation, promoting chlamydial replication. Interfering with the binding of C. trachomatis to EphA2, downregulation of EphA2 expression, or inhibition of EphA2 activity significantly reduces C. trachomatis infection. C. trachomatis interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface, resulting in Ctr and receptor internalization. During chlamydial replication, EphA2 remains active, accumulating around the inclusion and interacting with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway necessary for normal chlamydial development. Overexpression of full-length EphA2, but not the mutant form lacking the intracellular cytoplasmic domain, enhances PI3K activation and Ctr infection. Despite the depletion of EphA2 from the cell surface, Ctr infection induces upregulation of EphA2 through the activation of the ERK pathway, which keeps the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. These findings suggest that EphA2 is exploited by C. trachomatis as an entry and intracellular signaling receptor to facilitate chlamydial replication, representing a new mechanism by which Chlamydia subverts the host cell and induces apoptosis resistance.
"Neurons have active dendrites to enhance their dynamic range due to the enormous number of afferent synapses and large variability of input rates. The presence of extensive dendritic trees and active ion channels allows for non-linear summation and dendritic spikes, leading to ""dendritic computation."" This ability to perform computations and enhance dynamic range is not fully accounted for by passive cable theory or biophysical neuron models with few compartments. The collective behavior of interacting branchlets within a dendritic tree provides a theoretical background for understanding the cooperative behavior of these excitable media. This behavior includes the creation and annihilation of non-linear pulses, leading to a highly non-linear input-output transfer function and a very large dynamic range. This dynamic range is largely dependent on dimensionality, network topology, symmetries, parameter randomness, noise, and boundary conditions, rather than the detailed modeling of the basic compartmental unit."
The use of time-series transcriptomics data to infer regulatory interactions and create quantitative models of gene regulation has been extensively studied in various fields such as drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. However, these methods are based on assumptions regarding biological processes that may not always be valid. These assumptions include the use of mRNA abundance as a proxy for protein concentrations, and the assumption that changes in gene expression are solely due to transcription factors and specific regulators, neglecting global physiological effects. A study was conducted using models and experiments in vivo to investigate the importance of these assumptions and develop possible corrections. The study used time-series data of the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network to measure gene activity and estimate protein concentrations and global physiological effects. The findings suggest that correcting for the bias of the assumptions improves the quality of the models. The study shows that incorporating these corrections greatly improves inference results in the FliA-FlgM module, demonstrating the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives in the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters. Overall, the study's approach is applicable to various problems in network inference when using time-series transcriptome data.
A study on the rodent species Oligoryzomys fulvescens (O. fulvescens) was conducted in the community of Agua Buena, Tonosí County, Panama, between April 2006 and December 2009. The study aimed to characterize the landscape distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of O. fulvescens, an important mammalian reservoir in Central America. The research used a mark-recapture longitudinal study and spatial statistical analyses to examine the spatial association patterns among local populations of O. fulvescens. The study found that the local spatial abundance of O. fulvescens was spatially aggregated over relatively short distances and showed a shift in hot spots that changed over multiple years. The distribution and abundance of the O. fulvescens populations fluctuated widely both among the seasons and across years. The repeated absence of O. fulvescens at trapping sites during the transitional months of the season followed by its re-establishment suggests that the population is being maintained by repeated recolonization from somewhere off the study site. The research highlights the challenges in monitoring or predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks at the level of reservoir populations, which are subject to fluctuations over time and have geographically restricted populations. The study provides an important characterization of the challenges in understanding the environmental factors and seasonal cues that may be crucial to habitat shifts by zoonotic hosts.
"The inability to distinguish mutations that determine an organism's phenotype from ""hitchhiker"" mutations is a significant challenge in genome research, with important implications for medical and biotechnological applications. For human influenza viruses, recognizing changes in the antigenic phenotype and a strain's ability to evade pre-existing host immunity is crucial for producing efficient vaccines. A new method for inferring ""antigenic trees"" for the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin has been developed, which assigns antigenic weights to all tree branches and allows for the resolution of the antigenic impact of associated amino acid changes. This technique predicted antigenic distances with comparable accuracy to antigenic cartography and identified both known and novel sites and amino acid changes with antigenic impact in the evolution of influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2003. Influenza viruses cause approximately 500,000 deaths annually and are a significant threat to human health. The antigenic impact of individual amino acid exchanges is not yet fully understood, and computational methods for determining this impact do not exist, requiring time- and cost-intensive experimental characterization of mutant viruses. The method described in this study allows for a more fine-grained resolution of the antigenic impact of individual changes without the need for experimental characterization. This technique has significant implications for understanding the evolution and antigenic impact of mutations in influenza and other pathogens."
A high-throughput RNAi silencing screen identified a cluster of mitotic genes required for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection, revealing a new mechanism for import of the viral DNA into the nucleus. In interphase cells, viruses are endocytosed and routed to the perinuclear area, but the viral DNA (vDNA) fails to be imported into the nucleus. During mitosis, the vDNA and L2 associate with host cell chromatin on the metaphase plate, suggesting that HPV16 requires nuclear envelope breakdown for access of the vDNA to the nucleoplasm. This study highlights the value of genes found by RNAi screens for understanding viral infections and provides a resource for future virus-host cell interaction studies.
Black Sigatoka, caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis, is the most destructive foliar disease of bananas worldwide, requiring frequent fungicide applications that increase costs and lead to fungicide-resistant strains. The P. fijiensis genome, sequenced in two strains, is the largest among Dothideomycetes due to LTR retrotransposons, with genetic differentiation and high diversity in field populations. A homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector was identified, potentially aiding in fungicide treatment and breeding programs. The disease's impacts are significant, with enormous environmental costs and potential crop losses, particularly affecting the global banana trade and smallholder farmers who rely on bananas as a staple food. The P. fijiensis genome sequence offers insights into Dothideomycete genome structures and the potential for improved disease management.
A novel method to infer lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and trace their evolutionary origin was developed and applied to analyze the evolution of binding sites for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, ETS1) in the human lineage after the human-mouse common ancestor. The method utilizes a birth-death model to estimate the birth and death rates of TFBS, and infers the ancestral states of a given motif without relying on base-by-base alignment details in cross-species sequence alignments. The results show that a substantial fraction of binding sites (∼58-79% for each factor) in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse, and over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. These lineage-specific regulatory elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. This method helps understand the role of regulatory element evolution in shaping variation in gene regulation across species, and paves the way for further studies on the functional consequences of these lineage-specific regulatory elements.
The zebrafish is a valuable model for studying the process of circadian clock entrainment as its tissues directly respond to light, leading to local clock entrainment and gene expression, including clock genes. A Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter of the zebrafish period2 (per2) gene, which is proximal to the transcription start site, is both necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and clock regulation. The LRM is strongly conserved in other vertebrate per2 genes and contains E- and D-box elements that are critical for its function. The E-box directs circadian clock regulation, while the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression, with tef mRNA levels being light inducible. Knock-down of tef expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. These findings suggest a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression, extending the understanding of the mechanism of clock entrainment by light and the regulation of clock gene expression by light in vertebrates.
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which need to migrate at various stages of their complex life cycle. The sporozoite stage, which infects the liver, has the most impressive motility. It moves through the skin and other tissues using a gliding motion driven by actin filaments and myosin underneath the plasma membrane. Actin filaments are regulated by actin-binding proteins, including coronin, which is the only bona-fide actin filament-binding protein in Plasmodium. Coronin is conserved in Plasmodium species and has one or two WD40 repeat-containing β-propellers that mediate actin filament-binding. It can also bind membranes and interact with other proteins. In P. berghei, coronin localizes to the sporozoite periphery in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and contributes to parasite motility through actin filament-binding. It is required for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice. Coronin (−) parasites and parasites expressing mutated coronin show defects in salivary gland invasion and migration. Coronin might be involved in a switch in signaling pathways linking calcium- and cAMP-mediated signaling during migration and invasion.
Leishmania mexicana is a significant burden to global health, with few treatment options available. Amphotericin B (AmB) is an important drug for treating leishmaniasis, but resistance is a concern. Four novel AmB-resistant L. mexicana lines were studied, all with altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole genome sequencing revealed resistance-associated mutation of the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase in one line, while three out of four lines had loss of expression of sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT), responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. This loss of SMT expression was due to structural variations at the locus, possibly promoted by local regions of sequence homology and retrotransposon elements. This repeat sequence-mediated instability is concerning, as it provides an important example of how copy number instability in Leishmania genomes contributes to resistance to an antileishmanial drug of growing importance, with no evidence of associated fitness costs.
In this study, researchers aimed to understand the interaction between attention and prediction in the human brain, and how they modulate information processing. The researchers had participants perform a visual task while recording their neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were asked to attend or ignore a periodic stream of gratings, the orientations of which could be predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. The study applied forward encoding models to the EEG data to investigate the effects of attention on two distinct types of information: feature and mismatch information.The findings suggest that surprising stimuli evoke neural responses related to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features (mismatch information), and attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. Moreover, attention increased the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. These results support the theory that attention optimizes precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.The study also aimed to compare the 'mismatch information model' and the 'feature information model' in explaining the neural coding of surprising stimuli in the human brain and the influence of selective attention on each of these two neural codes. The results support the 'mismatch information model,' indicating that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli relative to unsurprising stimuli. It also suggests that top-down prediction signals cancel out bottom-up sensory signals that match the predicted content, leaving only the remaining prediction error to propagate forward and update a model of the sensory environment.In sum, this study employed forward encoding models on EEG data to understand the interaction between attention and prediction in information processing in the human brain. The findings support the theory that attention optimizes precision expectations during hierarchical inference and that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. The study provides new insights into the role of attention and prediction in information processing in the human brain.
Trypanosoma brucei, an important parasite in sub-Saharan Africa, has three sub-species with different geographical distributions, hosts, and diseases. T. b. brucei cannot infect humans because it is sensitive to trypanosome lytic factors (TLF) in human serum. However, T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense can infect humans as they are resistant to lysis by human serum. T. b. gambiense, the West African trypanosome, is responsible for over 90% of African sleeping sickness cases. A critical aspect of African trypanosome biology is that the adaptive immune response of vertebrates is ineffective due to the parasite's ability to evade the immune response by changing the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) antigens on its cell surface. Primates, including humans, rely on innate immunity to prevent infection in the form of TLFs in serum. There are two distinct forms of TLF particles, TLF-1 and TLF-2, in human serum. TLF-1 is a member of the HDL family, while TLF-2 is a related high molecular weight serum protein complex. HPR and APOL1 are two primate-specific proteins found in TLF, necessary for optimal lysis, and have complementary roles. HPR facilitates uptake of TLF-1 via the HpHbR receptor, while APOL1 has lytic activity against trypanosomes, disrupting their lysosome membrane and causing osmotic lysis. The two human-infective trypanosome sub-species have evolved counter-measures to overcome the innate defense factors. T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense have distinct mechanisms of human serum resistance. T. b. gambiense has two distinct groups that differ in genotype and phenotype. Group 1 T. b. gambiense has a stable human serum resistance trait that may, in part, be due to a reduced uptake of TLF-1, possibly due to reduced expression of the HpHbR receptor. Group 2 T. b. gambiense exhibits a variable human serum resistance phenotype superficially similar to T. b. rhodesiense. Research has shown that isogenic resistant and sensitive group 2 T. b. gambiense parasites expressed the HpHbR gene at similar levels and internalized TLF-1 similarly to T. b. brucei. However, unlike group 1 T. b. gambiense, group 2 parasites are resistant to the main lytic component APOL1, and the expression does not appear to correlate with a change in expression site or expression of HpHbR, suggesting differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between T. b. gambiense groups 1 and 2.
HIV-1 latency, the main obstacle to eradicating HIV-1 from infected patients, is established in a reservoir of resting memory CD4+ T cells that escapes host immune responses and antiretroviral therapy. Transcriptional shutdown and multistep formation of restrictive chromatin at long terminal repeats (LTR) lead to the latent state of HIV-1 provirus. CpG methylation of retroviral promoter sequences is another transcriptional silencing mechanism that contributes to difficulties in accessing transcription factors to target DNA. However, the role of proviral DNA methylation in HIV-1 latency is not clear. In an in vitro model of reactivable latency and in a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients, CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an additional epigenetic restriction mechanism that controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals and determines the stability of HIV-1 latency. Transcriptional reactivation is accompanied by changes in local chromatin structure and the recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors. Tight but incomplete control of HIV-1 latency by CpG methylation might have important implications for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1 infection.
The Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) is a population resource consisting of 192 sequenced wild-derived inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines, which is useful for understanding genome function due to the availability of powerful genetic tools and resources. A nucleotide-resolution catalog of variants, including SNPs, insertions, deletions, complex substitutions, and structural variants in 39 DGRP lines, was generated using an integrative approach for variant discovery. This allowed for the identification of over 3.6 million unique sequence variants across all 39 DGRP lines, including 2.8 million SNPs, 0.6 million indels, and 0.2 million complex sequence variants. The majority of these variants are a substantial source of genomic variation in Drosophila, with a SNP every 43 bp and an indel or complex variant every 144 bp. The accuracy of the variant catalogue is of similar quality as variant data produced for other organisms using high-throughput sequencing. This high-resolution variant data was then used to investigate the impact of naturally occurring genetic variation on adult gene expression, revealing novel insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in Drosophila.
The article discusses the use of rectified surface EMG signals as an estimator of neural drive to muscles, and how amplitude cancellation can distort this correlation. An ideal rectified EMG signal (EMGnc) without amplitude cancellation is shown to be a better estimator of the neural drive than the actual rectified EMG signal. The correlation between the neural drive and EMGnc is strong, but this correlation decreases linearly with amplitude cancellation. A stronger neural drive implies a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive, but amplitude cancellation distorts this correlation, particularly for low-frequency components of the neural drive. The study concludes that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons. The pool of motor neurons innervating a muscle receives a large relative proportion of common synaptic input, which is transmitted to the motor neuron output generating the neural drive to the muscle. The neural drive to muscles can be measured directly from motor unit recordings or indirectly inferred from surface EMG signals. However, the amplitude of the EMG signal can be influenced by the waveforms of the motor unit action potentials, and rectification of the EMG signal is typically recommended to reduce the influence of these waveforms. Amplitude cancellation can reduce the EMG amplitude and limit the possibility of accurately inferring individual frequency components of the neural drive to muscle from the rectified EMG.
Auxin, a phytohormone involved in various plant processes, is necessary for aluminum (Al) stress-induced root growth inhibition, but the molecular mechanism is largely unknown. The YUCCA (YUC) genes, which encode flavin monooxygenase-like proteins, regulate local auxin biosynthesis in the root apex transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. Al stress up-regulates YUC3/5/7/8/9 in the root-apex TZ, leading to auxin accumulation and root-growth inhibition. This process depends on ethylene signaling, as increasing or disrupting ethylene signaling enhances or reduces YUC up-regulation, respectively. Ethylene-insensitive3 (EIN3) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) function as transcriptional activators for YUC5/8/9 in this process. PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating local YUCs and auxin signal in the root-apex TZ. The Al-induced expression of PIF4 in root TZ acts downstream of ethylene signaling. YUCs play a role in the auxin response in the root-apex TZ during Al stress. Al stress up-regulates YUCs, driving up auxin accumulation in the root-apex TZ and inhibiting root growth. The Al stress-regulated up-regulation of YUCs is modulated by an ethylene-dependent process. EIN3 and EIL1 may play an important role in the Al-regulated local up-regulation of YUCs, as Al stress induces a clear local up-regulation of EIN3p:GFP and EIL1p:GFP in the root-apex TZ. EIN3 can physically bind to the YUC9 promoter, and EIN3 overexpression can increase YUC9 promoter activity. PIF4 is involved in Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating YUC5, YUC8, and YUC9 expression. YUCs are locally induced in the root-apex TZ in the presence of Al stress, and PIF4 regulates Al stress-induced local up-regulation of YUCs in root-apex TZ. The Al-induced local expression of PIF4 is regulated by ethylene signaling. The up-regulation of PIF4 in the root-apex TZ under Al stress is regulated by ethylene signaling, as Al stress-induced up-regulation of PIF4p:GFP in the root-apex TZ is intensified by the ACC co-treatment, but repressed by the AVG co-treatment.
Natural killer (NK) cells in primates are regulated in part by interactions between two highly polymorphic molecules, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on NK cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands on target cells. A common MHC class I molecule in the rhesus macaque, Mamu-A1*002, binds to the inhibitory receptor Mamu-KIR3DL05, and this interaction is stabilized by certain simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides. These SIV peptides, when bound by Mamu-A1*002, suppress the cytolytic activity of primary Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells. Changes in C-terminal positions of the peptide can convert inhibitory peptides into disinhibitory peptides, and vice versa. Viral peptides can differentially affect NK cell responses by modulating MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs, providing a mechanism by which immunodeficiency viruses may evade NK cell responses. NK cells play an important role in innate defense against viral pathogens, differentiating virus-infected cells from healthy cells through the integration of complex signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. Polymorphic differences in KIR and HLA class I genes can influence the course of HIV-1 infection, as well as the outcome of infection with other viral pathogens. Immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-1 and SIV, may acquire changes in epitopes that increase the binding of MHC class I ligands to inhibitory KIRs to impair NK cell killing of virus-infected cells.
Bacterial pathogens, including nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), must sense, respond, and adapt to various microenvironmental stressors to survive and cause chronic infections. A study examining NTHI-induced otitis media (OM) found that strains adapted to survive nutrient deprivation may be more adept at colonization and chronic infection. In a preclinical model of NTHI-induced OM, transient nutrient limitation resulted in microevolution of NTHI, with a mutation in the icc gene leading to decreased 3' , 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity. This mutation resulted in decreased recovery of middle ear fluid, indicative of disease resolution, but bacterial burdens in the middle ear remained similar to the parental strain. Additionally, the icc mutant formed significantly more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the parental strain. These findings suggest that NTHI microevolution during nutritional limitation may contribute to both chronic and recurrent disease associated with OM. Bacteria, including NTHI, can adapt to stresses such as nutrient limitation through transcriptional, epigenetic, and genetic mechanisms. Identification of genes subject to microevolution provides insight into new therapeutic targets to quell infection.
Iron plays a critical role in host-pathogen interactions, being a crucial nutrient for both microbial pathogens and their mammalian hosts. Macrophages are essential for immune function and also contribute to iron homeostasis maintenance by obtaining heme iron from phagocytosed senescent or damaged erythrocytes and utilizing transferrin-bound iron or non-transferrin-bound iron via specific transporters. The natural resistance macrophage protein 1 can pump iron from late endosomes and phagolysosomes into the cytoplasm, while the lipocalin 2 receptor allows macrophages to acquire both iron-laden and iron-free complexes of siderophores and lipocalin 2. Excess intracellular iron is stored in ferritin, or exported by the transmembrane protein ferroportin, whose expression is increased by heme and iron. The expression of ferroportin is controlled systemically by hepcidin, an acute-phase peptide secreted by hepatocytes and macrophages, leading to intracellular iron accumulation and hypoferremia when bound to ferroportin. Limiting iron availability from invading pathogens represents a key pathway in host defense, and successful pathogens must employ mechanisms to evade nutritional immunity to cause disease.Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a gram-negative bacterium found in tropical and subtropical areas, with its major endemic regions in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The bacterium can enter, survive, and replicate within mammalian host cells by using a type three secretion system. Previous work has pointed toward a link between high iron levels and the occurrence of B. pseudomallei in soil or water samples. Iron supplementation in soil can affect the growth of B. pseudomallei, increase biofilm formation, and change the pathogen's morphology, which may be advantageous for its persistence in the environment and transmission to humans. B. pseudomallei produces a hydroxamate-type siderophore, malleobactin, able to capture iron from host proteins transferrin and lactoferrin, and several genes encoding iron acquisition systems, including for the siderophore pyochelin and the uptake of heme or plasma membrane iron transporters.Recent studies revealed that conditions with enhanced iron stores, such as thalassemia or idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, are risk factors for melioidosis. However, the contribution of the HO-1 metabolite iron during B. pseudomallei infection is not well understood. Therefore, a study was conducted to define the changes of macrophage iron homeostasis upon infection and to elucidate the importance of such modifications for host susceptibility or resistance to infection. The study found that B. pseudomallei has developed strategies to circumvent iron restriction mechanisms of the host and that alterations in iron homeostasis can influence the course of murine melioidosis.
"The authors propose a novel technique called ""functional mode analysis"" to identify collective motions directly related to a specific protein function. This technique requires an ensemble of protein structures and a ""functional quantity"" that quantifies the functional state of the protein. The functional quantity could be a geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observable, or any other variable relevant to the protein's function. The technique detects the collective motion that is maximally correlated to the functional quantity and estimates the motion that is most likely to induce a substantial change in the functional quantity. The paper applies this approach to several biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein.Protein function is often the result of collective atomic motions. Identifying these motions and relating them to the protein's function is essential for understanding its functional mechanisms. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and single-molecule fluorescence or electron-transfer measurements have been used to elucidate collective motions in proteins. However, established methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and normal mode analysis (NMA) may not necessarily yield collective motions directly related to protein function.The proposed functional mode analysis (FMA) technique seeks to address this challenge by elucidating collective motions directly related to a specific protein function. FMA requires a set of protein structures and a ""functional quantity"" expressed as a single number for each input structure. The functional quantity can be a geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observable relevant to the protein's function. FMA seeks the collective protein motion that is maximally related to the functional quantity, aiming to explain variations in the functional quantity in terms of collective motions.The paper provides four examples of FMA applied to a polyalanine helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein. The examples demonstrate FMA's ability to detect functionally relevant collective motions. The proposed method could help better understand the complex interplay between protein motion and function, ultimately contributing to a more profound understanding of protein function and behavior."
Nuclear genes of certain eukaryotes, particularly euglenids and marine diplonemids, contain unique, nonconventional introns that differ from typical spliceosomal introns found in other eukaryotic genomes. These nonconventional introns have no conserved borders, and they form a stable secondary structure bringing together both exon/intron junctions. The removal of nonconventional introns occurs rapidly but later than spliceosomal introns. An analysis of the tubA and gapC genes in Euglena gracilis, which contain both types of introns, revealed that conventional introns are removed before nonconventional introns. Additionally, the order of intron removal is not always consistent with their arrangement in the gene or transcript. The splicing of adjacent introns generally follows a 'first-come-first-served' model, but several factors, such as intron length, exon length, and the composition of intronic and exonic splicing enhancers and silencers, can influence the directing of intron removal. Non-collinear removal of introns from pre-mRNA is observed in transcripts undergoing alternative splicing, wherein constitutive introns are mainly co-transcriptionally removed, whereas alternative introns are removed post-transcriptionally.
Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is a common enterovirus that typically causes a self-limited febrile illness in infants but can occasionally lead to severe infection and manifest as acute myocarditis. The chronic consequences of mild CVB infection are unknown, but there is an epidemiologic association between early subclinical infections and late heart failure. A mouse model of juvenile CVB3 infection demonstrated that subclinical doses of CVB3 caused no evident symptoms in mice, but following physiological or pharmacologically-induced cardiac stress, juvenile-infected adult mice underwent cardiac hypertrophy and dilation, indicating progression to heart failure. Evaluation of the vasculature in the hearts of adult mice subjected to cardiac stress showed a compensatory increase in CD31+ blood vessel formation, although this effect was suppressed in juvenile-infected mice. Furthermore, CVB3 efficiently infected juvenile c-kit+ cells, and cardiac progenitor cell numbers were reduced in the hearts of juvenile-infected adult mice. These results suggest that the exhausted cardiac progenitor cell pool following juvenile CVB3 infection may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density to adapt to increased load.CV are human pathogens that typically cause a self-limited infection with mild symptoms, but can also cause severe inflammatory diseases including myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Although the manifestation of a cardiac disease phenotype is rare, it has been documented that subclinical CV infection can cause subtle but lasting injury, although it is unclear whether such enduring damage is immune-mediated or due to virus-mediated cytopathic effects. Previous studies suggest that CVB3 may exhibit unique tropism for undifferentiated cells such as neural and hematopoietic progenitor cells, thereby altering cell lineage commitment or diminishing their restorative capacity.Based on these observations, researchers investigated the effect of CVB3 on CPCs in the developing heart. They established a mouse model of juvenile CVB3 infection and observed that not only did CVB3 productively infect CPCs but infection caused a sustained reduction in the CPC pool into adulthood. These results suggest that a mild CVB3 infection may predispose the heart to pathologic remodeling later in adult life, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. Immunostaining confirmed that in infected mice, viral protein expression colocalized with c-kit and Sca-1, indicating infection of CPCs in the juvenile heart. Viral protein expression was not observed in the surrounding myocardium, suggesting that CPCs were preferentially targeted for infection in the juvenile heart.Overall, these findings suggest that juvenile CVB3 infection may cause long-term consequences for heart development and function through the infection and depletion of cardiac progenitor cells, leading to an increased susceptibility to stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular dilation, and fibrosis, which are early stages of dilated cardiomyopathy.
The bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, regulates IL-1β and IL-18 production through NOD-like receptors NLRP3 and NLRC4, and pyroptosis. A recent study has investigated the downstream signalling pathways of these receptors and the role of B. pseudomallei factors in inflammasome activation. The study found that caspase-1 processing and pyroptosis is dependent on NLRC4, but not on NLRP3 in the early phase of macrophage infection. During the early phase, an activation pathway involving caspases-9, -7 and PARP downstream of NLRC4 and caspase-1 was identified. In contrast, at later time points, caspase-1 activation and cell death was NLRC4-independent. Infection with B. pseudomallei resulted in an early, dose-dependent cell death in wild-type macrophages but a delayed cell death in caspase-1/11 KO macrophages. The B. pseudomallei flagellin FliC, T3SS3 effector protein BopE and the inner rod protein BsaK were found to play a role in caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis induction, and IL-1β secretion, and their function in primary macrophages and murine melioidosis was also characterized. This information is crucial in understanding the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and the host immune response towards it.
The KINβγ protein, a subunit of the SNF1-related protein kinase 1 complex, plays crucial roles in the regulation of plant development and is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the vegetative cells of pollen grains in Arabidopsis. In pollen, the kinβγ mutant is unable to germinate on the stigma, but germinates normally in vitro. This is due to the compromised hydration of the mutant pollen on the stigma, which can be promoted by adding water to the stigma, indicating that the compromised hydration of the mutant pollen leads to its defective germination. The mutant pollen exhibits destroyed mitochondria and peroxisome structures, reduced numbers, and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensates for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen, and reducing ROS levels in pollen by overexpressing Arabidopsis CATALASE 3 results in compromised hydration of pollen on the stigma. These results suggest that Arabidopsis KINβγ is critical for the regulation of ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is required for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination.
RNase III is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in double-stranded RNA processing in both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. It is involved in various cellular functions such as ribosomal RNA maturation, bacterial gene silencing, and the regulation of small RNAs. However, the function of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis is unique, as it is essential for the survival of the organism, unlike in other bacteria. This essential role of RNase III in B. subtilis is due to the protection it provides against the expression of toxin genes borne by two prophages, Skin and SPβ, through antisense RNA.Specifically, RNase III is responsible for the degradation of two type I toxin-encoding mRNAs, txpA from Skin and yonT from SPβ, and its absence leads to an increase in the steady-state levels of these toxin mRNAs. Inactivation of RNase III results in the overexpression of these toxin mRNAs, leading to cell toxicity. Moreover, the antitoxin for the txpA toxin is the RatA RNA, which has a 3′ end that overlaps with the toxin mRNA, and overexpression of RatA leads to the degradation of the txpA toxin RNA.These findings suggest that RNase III has a specific function in B. subtilis that cannot be removed, unlike in other bacteria where the rnc gene can be deleted. This specific function is related to its role in toxin mRNA turnover, particularly in the degradation of type I toxin-encoding mRNAs. The Skin prophage is more detrimental than the SPβ prophage in strains lacking RNase III, suggesting that the presence of Skin is the most detrimental in an RNase III mutant strain.In summary, RNase III plays a critical role in double-stranded RNA processing and has various cellular functions in both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. However, its function in B. subtilis is unique and essential for the survival of the organism. It plays a specific role in toxin mRNA turnover, specifically in the degradation of type I toxin-encoding mRNAs, and its absence leads to cell toxicity due to the overexpression of these toxin mRNAs.
The filarial nematode Brugia malayi, which causes the disease lymphatic filariasis, can modify the biology of its host, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. One theory is that parasite-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) release bioactive proteins and small RNA species, allowing for the secretion of parasite effector molecules and their potential trafficking to host tissues. Research has shown that EVs are released by all life stages of B. malayi, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult males, and adult females, and these EVs are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, indicating a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs has revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome, helping to define the biogenesis of Brugia EVs and revealing sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo. Ivermectin, a drug used to treat lymphatic filariasis, has been found to rapidly inhibit EV release by all Brugia life stages, highlighting a potential mechanism of action for this drug and suggesting new screening platforms for anti-filarial drug development. This research has important implications for our understanding of the interactions between parasitic nematodes and their hosts and for the development of new treatments for lymphatic filariasis.
In the Solomon Islands, a Pacific island nation, a study was conducted to determine the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in ten rural villages in the Western Province. Of the 1908 participants, 19.2% had scabies and 26.7% had active impetigo, with the highest prevalence in children aged 1-4 years. Scabies infestation was significantly associated with active impetigo, with 41.1% of active impetigo cases also having scabies. Multiple studies have shown increased scabies prevalence associated with poverty and overcrowding. The World Health Organization has recognized scabies as a neglected tropical disease, and controlling scabies could potentially reduce the burden of impetigo and its complications. Mass drug administration of topical scabicides and oral ivermectin has shown promising results in reducing scabies and impetigo prevalence. Further investigation into the effect of single-dose azithromycin against staphylococcal and streptococcal skin disease is warranted.
The study of the relationship between T-cells and hippocampal neurogenesis has been motivated by the observation that rates of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differ between inbred strains of mice, indicating that quantitative trait loci (QTL) contribute to this variation. A genetic approach was adopted to address the question of whether QTLs influencing neurogenesis could be found that influenced other phenotypes, which might cast light on the function of neurogenesis. The study used heterogeneous stock (HS) mice, which are descended from eight inbred progenitor strains and maintained for over 50 generations, and mapped QTLs to an average region of 3 Mb. The HS is unique for its high resolution and the number of QTLs that have been mapped, as well as for the diversity of traits analyzed. The phenotypes include those previously suggested to be related to neurogenesis: novelty suppressed feeding, measures of anxiety taken in an elevated plus maze and open field, and contextual fear conditioning. The study assessed cellular proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus by counting the absolute number of KI67-positive cells in 719 HS animals and found a correlation with four behavioral measures assessed in the same HS animals, as well as a correlation with changes in the relative proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells among blood CD3+ lymphocytes. Higher levels of hippoc influencing cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and variation in the distribution of T cell lineages suggests that one phenotype influences the other. Mapping QTLs contributing to variation in cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and comparing their location to QTLs previously mapped for %CD8+ among CD3+ T cells found QTLs with the same location for both phenotypes on five chromosomes. To test whether variation in T cell lineages and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus have a common genetic origin, the study included %CD8+ in CD3+ as a covariate in a linear model for KI67 and mapped the residuals. The results indicate that common genetic loci contribute to variation in the two phenotypes. Comparison between QTLs influencing behavioral measures putatively related to hippocampal neurogenesis and KI67 showed little overlap in location. The genetic data are consistent with a model in which adult neurogenesis influences T cells and also with one in which T cells influence neurogenesis. The study tested the first model by ablating adult neurogenesis and then looking for changes in T cells and found no significant difference in T cell subsets after ablation of neurogenesis. The second hypothesis, an effect of T cell function on neurogenesis, was examined by studying a series of mouse mutants with alterations in T cell differentiation. The results implicate cells expressing the αβT cell receptor and excluding B and γδT lymphocytes, and suggest that the presence of CD4+ cells mediates the effect of lymphocytes on neurogenesis.
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major health problem in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US. A previously conducted computational/bioinformatics study identified antigens in the T. cruzi sequence database with vaccine candidate characteristics. A subsequent study investigated the protective efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine (TcVac2) consisting of these candidates and cytokine (IL-12 and GM-CSF) expression plasmids in a murine model. The results showed that TcVac2 induced a strong antigen-specific antibody response and a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines, resulting in control of acute parasite burden. During the chronic phase, the antibody response persisted, and tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart and skeletal muscle of TcVac2-vaccinated chronic mice were undetectable by histological techniques. In contrast, mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded to T. cruzi by elicitation of a mixed (type 1/type 2) antibody, T cell and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. Therefore, TcVac2-induced activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T. cruzi infection and prevented the evolution of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying disease susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases. However, the ability to quantify individual disease risk based on genotype data for personalized prevention and treatment remains an open question. Previous studies have primarily failed due to the use of only a limited number of confirmed susceptibility loci. A new study suggests that sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers may improve disease risk assessment performance. The study used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and applied it to a GWAS dataset generated on the Affymetrix genotyping platform for type 1 diabetes (T1D). The SVM model was optimized using hundreds of markers and tested on two independent datasets. The results showed an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of approximately 0.84 in both datasets. The study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers. Genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays. Genome-wide association studies have enabled human geneticists to examine a wide range of complex phenotypes and have allowed the confirmation and replication of previously unsuspected susceptibility loci for various diseases such as T2D, T1D, CD, height, and dyslipidemia. However, these variants still explain only a small proportion of individual differences in disease predisposition or phenotypic diversity. The remaining genetic variance still represents a challenge for the foreseeable future. Besides identifying genes influencing disease susceptibility or phenotypic variation, another often suggested utility of GWAS is that these discoveries will facilitate implementation of personalized medicine. However, for common and complex diseases, the application of personalized medicine may not be as straightforward. Previous studies have shown limited predictive value, and the performance of these studies is far below what would be considered clinically feasible or practical. Therefore, the failure of previous studies to predict individual disease risk is not unexpected due to the omission of the vast majority of genuine susceptibility loci that are yet to be validated from GWAS. The study suggests that using an entire list of markers reaching a pre-defined statistical threshold for association with a disease and utilizing machine-learning techniques such as SVM can optimize prediction modeling and take advantage of potential interactions between markers to achieve the optimal binary predictive power.
Memory CD8+ T cells are a crucial component of the immune system, providing protective immunity against re-infection by viruses and other intracellular pathogens. They exhibit a variety of functional characteristics, such as the production of cytokines and cytolytic activity, and are able to infiltrate and/or be retained in non-lymphoid tissues. Memory CD8+ T cells can be classified as circulating or tissue-resident (TRM). TRM CD8+ T cells are often located at environmental barriers and are responsible for immediate protection against re-infections prior to the trafficking of additional circulating memory CD8+ T cells into the site of infection. The tissue microenvironment plays a critical role in regulating the differentiation of TRM CD8+ T cells, with local inflammation promoting the acquisition of the TRM phenotype. CD69 and CD103 are commonly used to identify TRM CD8+ T cells in the skin, and TGF-β signaling may be an important retention signal for TRM differentiation in the skin. The ultimate fate of activated CD8+ T cells is highly dependent on the integration of conflicting signals that either promote or inhibit non-lymphoid tissue recruitment and retention. In a study, it was found that circulating memory CD8+ T cells rapidly traffic into the skin following vaccinia virus (VacV) infection independent of their ability to survey peripheral lymph nodes and provide significant protective immunity. In contrast to naïve CD8+ T cells, most circulating TCM CD8+ T cells do not express CD103 in the skin microenvironment during the resolution of viral infection and only a subset ultimately become functional CD69+/CD103- TRM. Following entry into VacV-infected skin, circulating memory CD8+ T cells expressed granzyme B and required cytolytic function to provide protection against VacV infection. Altogether, this study demonstrates that TCM CD8+ T cells rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues in response to local inflammatory cues, accelerate viral clearance, and become secondary CD69+ TRM that form following the resolution of viral skin infection, an important consideration for tissue-specific vaccine development. Acute systemic infection with LCMV-Armstrong causes antigen-specific TRM CD8+ T cells to be seeded in a variety of non-lymphoid tissues, but it does not generate TRM CD8+ T cells in the skin. However, infection of the skin with VacV generates both circulating memory CD8+ T cells as well as TRM in the previously infected skin. Following TCR engagement, TRM CD8+ T cells rapidly produce IFNγ that initiates a local inflammatory response and also promotes a general “anti-viral” state in the tissue microenvironment. Circulating memory CD8+ T cells rapidly enter non-lymphoid tissues and also provide significant protective immunity against viral skin infection.
Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons, while myosin motors contribute to the enrichment of both axonal and dendritic proteins at the plasma membranes of the appropriate polar compartments. After synthesis in the secretory pathway, axonal and dendritic transmembrane proteins follow distinct transport pathways to the plasma membrane. Axonal and dendritic proteins are transported by kinesin motors, but targeting of dendritic proteins cannot be explained by the intrinsic properties of dendritic kinesins. Recent work indicates that vesicles are targeted to dendrites through the actions of plus-end-directed myosin motors, suggesting that a minus-end-directed motor might participate in the localization of axonal proteins. Myosin VI, which moves towards the pointed (or minus) end of actin filament, is a good candidate for this role due to its involvement in endocytosis and association with clathrin-coated vesicles and proteins that mediate endocytosis. A version of Channelrhodopsin 2 that was engineered to bind to Myosin VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, suggesting its potential as a useful tool for probing circuit structure and function.
Daphnia magna, a freshwater crustacean, determines its sex through environmental cues, which triggers alternative genetic signals and regulates male or female sex-determining genes. Two categories of sex-determining systems are genetic and environmental, with the former being more prevalent in animals. Environmental sex determination (ESD) is found in various taxa, including rotifers, nematodes, crustaceans, insects, fishes, and reptiles. ESD has arisen repeatedly during evolution, implying its adaptive significance. Genes involved in ESD share similar genetic components with genetic sex determination (GSD), and both may have the same origin. The water flea Daphnia magna uses ESD, with juvenile hormone being a key molecule for understanding this process. A Doublesex (Dsx) gene, initially identified in D. melanogaster, plays a critical role in sex determination cascades in GSD by targeting genes that confer sexually dimorphic traits. Dsx has two conserved domains: a Dsx/Mab-3 domain at the N-terminus and an oligomerization domain at the C-terminus. Genes encoding DM-domain have been discovered in various species, including vertebrates. However, other genetic sex-determining genes are widely diverse among species. In D. magna, two Dsx genes were found, with DapmaDsx1 playing an essential role in directing the major sexually dimorphic development of D. magna. The function of Dsx is significantly conserved between Daphnia and genetic sex-determining insect species, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the factors that regulate Dsx gene expression are independently co-opted in each lineage. This functional demonstration that Dsx controls sexual dimorphism in an environmental sex-determining organism supports the hypothesis that genetic and environmental sex determination are similar at their most fundamental level.
A trivalent vaccine containing HSV-2 glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC2, gD2, gE2) along with CpG and alum has been found to be highly effective in preventing genital herpes in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs. The vaccine works by inducing plasma and mucosa neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that block gC2 and gE2 immune evasion activities, and stimulating CD4 T cell responses. In guinea pigs, the trivalent vaccine was 97% efficacious in preventing genital lesions and significantly reduced HSV-2 DNA shedding and shedding of replication competent virus compared to gD2 alone. The trivalent vaccine has the potential to prevent genital herpes in humans and reduce the incidence of neonatal herpes and the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. Currently, no vaccine for genital herpes is available and the prevalence of genital herpes is high, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. A vaccine for genital herpes is urgently needed to prevent the pain and suffering associated with the disease and to reduce the transmission and acquisition of HIV.
The development of next generation sequencing has enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by ChIP-seq, but interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have been difficult to map due to short read lengths mapping to multiple locations. Standard analytical methods discard these multi-mapping reads, leading to a loss of valuable data. Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, has been developed to accurately allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genome. Perm-seq significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over methods that do not utilize additional data types and can be supervised with a variety of data sources, including histone ChIP-seq. The application of Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Although these interactions are evolutionarily less conserved, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions. Current state-of-the-art approaches for allocating multi-mapping reads rely on utilizing read counts of the local neighborhoods of the mapping positions, but these approaches have critical limitations when the local neighborhood read counts of the mapping positions are highly similar. Perm-seq utilizes data from DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing (DNase-seq) experiments to inform read allocation in ChIP-seq and has significant power for discriminating between the mapping locations of multi-reads with similar local ChIP-seq read counts. A probabilistic model utilizing DNase-seq derived priors maps reads originating from highly repetitive regions with high accuracy, and the Perm-seq framework is versatile enough to enable incorporation of multiple sources of data such as histone ChIP-seq for read allocation. The reanalysis of a large collection of ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets with Perm-seq identifies many novel protein-DNA interaction targets in highly repetitive regions of the genome, especially in segmental duplications, and these novel targets share similar chromatin signatures with repetitive and non-repetitive modes of protein-DNA interactions. H2a . z ChIP-seq data performs as well as DNase-seq data for supervising allocation of multi-reads in highly repetitive regions.
Schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm infection affecting over 218 million people worldwide, has been associated with increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and impaired immune control of HIV-1 in infected individuals. A nested case-control study within a large population-based survey of HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania revealed that women with schistosome infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without (adjusted OR = 2.8 [1.2--6.6], p = 0.019). Schistosome-infected men did not have increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition. Additionally, HIV-1 seroconverters with schistosome infection had significantly higher median whole blood HIV-1 RNA levels (4.4 [3.9--4.6] log10 copies/mL) compared to those without schistosomiasis (3.7 [3.2--4.3], p = 0.017). This study suggests that pre-existing schistosome infection increases odds of HIV-1 acquisition in women and raises HIV-1 viral load at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. Further validation studies are needed to confirm these findings.
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a highly variable region in the human genome with respect to copy number and is vital for cellular function. However, the factors governing its copy number, stability, and sequence in the mammalian genome are largely unknown due to challenges in mapping and analysis. A study using computational and droplet digital PCR approaches measured rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes and found that copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Human cancer genomes show a loss of copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation, and cancer genomes with lower copies have mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. This loss of copies is a recurrent feature in cancers associated with mTOR activation and rDNA copy number may be a simple and useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA damaging treatments. Furthermore, recent technological developments enable accurate and high throughput measurements of the copy number of the rDNA, which can be estimated from whole-genome sequence and droplet digital PCR. The plethora of cancer genome sequencing projects allows comparison between the copy number in the tumor genome versus the normal genome from a single individual and has shown that rDNA copy number is reduced in cancer genomes with mTOR activation.
A study was conducted to understand the bacterial population dynamics in a whole-animal infection model, specifically focusing on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infections in mice. The researchers used an integrated approach that relied on tracing tagged subpopulations of otherwise identical bacteria through infected animals and their organs. Eight wild-type isogenic tagged strains (WITS) were generated, each carrying a different 40-bp DNA signature tag in the same noncoding region of the chromosome. Using inoculations consisting of mixtures of low numbers of each tagged strain, the dynamics of each subpopulation were monitored at different body sites throughout the course of a systemic infection. The researchers addressed three specific questions about the dynamics of infection: how an acute bacterial infection replicates and grows in infected organs, whether the spread of infection within and between organs results from homogeneous bacterial growth or from expansion of subpopulations, and how components of the immune response affect spatiotemporal bacterial population dynamics. By using depletion of tagged diversity as a proxy for bacterial death and spatiotemporal heterogeneity as a proxy for bacterial transfer between organs as a function of time postinoculation, the researchers were able to develop mathematical models to dissect the determinants of net growth at different infection stages and map local (intraorgan) versus systemic spread of each bacterial subpopulation. The findings of this study illustrate that to understand the basic idiosyncrasies of infection requires a disaggregation of the global disease dynamics and awareness of the separate infection dynamics of subpopulations within the same host.
The inverse optics problem of local binocular 3D motion perception has yet to be fully solved by existing processing schemes such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity. A more flexible framework for solving this problem is proposed, using local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues. This approach suggests that motion and disparity input is processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy. Three main processing models have emerged in the literature for 3D motion perception: Interocular velocity difference (IOVD), changing disparity over time (CDOT), and joint encoding of motion and disparity (JEMD). However, psychophysical results have been inconclusive and the nature of 3D motion processing remains an unresolved issue. The aperture problem, which features prominently in 2D motion perception, has been neglected in the study of 3D motion perception. Large and persistent perceptual bias has been found for dot stimuli with unambiguous motion direction, suggesting processing strategies that are different from the three main processing models. It seems promising to investigate local motion stimuli with ambiguous motion direction such as a line or contour moving inside a circular aperture, because they relate to local encoding and may reveal principles of 3D motion processing. The aim of this paper is to evaluate existing models of 3D motion perception and to gain a better understanding of binocular 3D motion perception.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative pathogen, causes acute and chronic infections, and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. It forms biofilms, composed primarily of secreted extracellular polysaccharides, making it more resistant to antibiotics and host defense mechanisms. Alginate is an exopolysaccharide synthesized in the cytoplasm and modified in the periplasm through O-acetylation and epimerization during chronic lung infections in CF patients. Modification of polysaccharides through the addition or removal of acetate is an essential biological process for survival and virulence in many bacterial species. The O-acetylation of alginate in P. aeruginosa is an important modification as acetylated alginate is less susceptible to recognition and clearance by the host immune system than its non-O-acetylated counterpart. AlgJ and AlgX are required for alginate acetylation, both annotated as O-acetyltransferases. However, recent studies suggest that they have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation, with AlgX as the terminal acetyltransferase. The anionic, O-acetylated exopolysaccharide alginate, secreted by P. aeruginosa, is a major constituent of a protective biofilm matrix during chronic lung infections in CF patients. Four proteins, AlgIJF and AlgX, have been implicated in alginate O-acetylation. AlgJ, a SGNH hydrolase-like protein, exhibits a distinct electrostatic surface potential and acetylesterase activity in vitro. However, it exhibits weak or no detectable polymer binding in vitro, in contrast to AlgX, which binds polymannuronic acid specifically in a length-dependent manner. AlgX can utilize a surrogate acetyl-donor to catalyze the O-acetylation of polymannuronic acid. These results suggest that AlgX is the terminal acetyltransferase in alginate acetylation, while AlgJ has a different role. This refined model provides a rationale for the variability in the number of proteins required for polysaccharide O-acetylation in different bacterial species and their distinct roles in the process.
Candida albicans, a commensal human fungal pathogen, causes a range of infections from superficial mucosal surfaces to severe systemic bloodstream infections, with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. Current antifungal agents have limitations due to drug resistance or toxicity. The fungal cell wall is a potential drug target due to its role in pathogenicity, presenting virulence factors, antigenic cell wall proteins and polysaccharides, and serving as the intermediate for fungal-host interactions. One approach to improve anti-fungal strategies is to enhance the detection of fungal cell wall antigens by host immune cells. Dectin-1, a C-type signaling lectin receptor in innate immune cells, recognizes β (1, 3) -glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls. C. albicans masks β (1, 3) -glucan from Dectin-1 detection via the outer layer of mannosylated proteins. However, unmasking of β (1, 3) -glucan can be induced through treatments with drugs such as echinocandins or by certain genetic mutations that disrupt cell wall integrity. The PS synthase enzyme (Cho1) controls cell wall β (1, 3) -glucan exposure. The homozygous CHO1 mutant, cho1Δ/Δ, exhibits greater β (1, 3) -glucan exposure compared to wild-type. The Cek1 MAPK cascade, composed of a conserved module of three kinases, controls β (1, 3) -glucan masking in C. albicans. CEK1 null mutants display unmasking of β (1, 3) -glucan and hyper-sensitivity to agents that disturb the cell wall such as Congo red. Activation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway causes unmasking of β (1, 3) -glucan and increases pro-inflammatory responses from macrophages, which is distinct from that seen at bud scars. In the cho1Δ/Δ mutant, there is upregulation of the activity of both Cek1 and Mkc1 MAPKs, and a higher concentration of active Cdc42 than wild-type. Cells overexpressing CDC42G12V, a hyperactive allele of CDC42, exhibited decreased proliferation and increased β (1, 3) -glucan exposure. The Cek1 pathway can cause β (1, 3) -glucan exposure when hyper-activated, and this may help explain the increased β (1, 3) -glucan exposure seen in the cho1Δ/Δ mutant. However, the Mkc1 pathway is also upregulated in cho1Δ/Δ, and both pathways play a role in β (1, 3) -glucan exposure.
A genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia were performed using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. The neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD, and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes. Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and Lewy body disease with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene. GalNAc transferase 7, ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G, Member 1, and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with neuritic plaque score, and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 was strongly associated with hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for neurofibrillary tangles or neuritic plaques showed positive correlation, while those for risk of vascular brain injury showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. This study discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.
"Urea is a denaturant commonly used in studying protein folding/unfolding, but its ultimate reasons for its denaturing properties remain elusive. The dominant paradigm suggests that urea interacts with exposed protein residues more strongly than water, but the nature of this preferential interaction is unclear. Some claim it is electrostatic and related to direct hydrogen bonds, while others suggest it is due to preferential dispersion. There is also discussion regarding whether the major destabilizing effect of urea is related to interaction with the backbone or side chains, and if so, which side chains: polar and charged or apolar. A recent study combined multi-replica molecular dynamics simulations and direct NMR measures of ubiquitin to characterize the ""urea unfolded ensemble"" of this model protein. The results suggest that urea stabilizes flexible over-extended conformations of the protein, which are unlikely to be sampled in the ""unfolded"" state of aqueous proteins. However, this study did not provide information on the kinetic role of urea in the unfolding process. To analyze this point, a study of the effect of urea in the first stages of thermochemical unfolding is needed. This study performed microsecond-long atomistic simulations using 30 proteins covering all major protein folds and several of the most popular force-fields to investigate the first stages of urea-driven protein unfolding. The results revealed robust trends that illustrate the effect of urea during the early stages of protein unfolding, providing a complete picture of the role of urea in destabilizing folded states of proteins and on the molecular mechanisms by means of which urea contributes to accelerating protein unfolding."
A systematic literature review was conducted to study the epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia between 2000 and 2012. The review identified 30 relevant studies out of 225 citations, which showed a stable number of dengue fever cases and major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2
Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is a skin and mucosal tissue disease caused by Leishmania parasites, which can co-exist with other pathogens in human populations, impacting TL's clinical outcome. This review focused on the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and implications for clinical practice. The search resulted in 73 records, including 21 experimental studies and 52 human studies. Co-infection frequencies vary, with approximately 41% of TL patients in Argentina carrying Trypanosoma cruzi and 15%-88% of TL patients in Brazil carrying helminths. Interactions between pathogens may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting acquired immune responses. Diagnostic problems, reduced effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment, and cumulative adverse effects of drug combinations can occur in TL coinfections. More research is needed to understand how coinfections interfere with TL pathogenesis and clinical management.
The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a gene-dense region affecting MHC expression and T cell selection, but the specific genes responsible have not been identified. This study aimed to assess the impact of natural genetic variation on MHC expression and CD4:CD8 lineage commitment using two genetic models in rats. The first model, Heterogeneous Stock rats, identified 10 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) across the genome, with QTLs for individual traits colocalizing in the MHC region. A large panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains refined the QTLs to two 0.25 Mb intervals in the MHC-I and II regions, with an interaction between these intervals affecting MHC class I expression and negative selection/lineage commitment of CD8 single-positive thymocytes. The interaction was mapped to the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 (Tap2) in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene (s) in the MHC-I region. Variants of Tap2 have been previously shown to influence the antigenicity of MHC class I molecules by altering the MHC class I ligandome, and this study shows a restricted peptide repertoire on MHC class I molecules leads to reduced negative selection of CD8SP cells. Overall, this study shows how a recombination between natural alleles of genes in the MHC influences lineage commitment of T cells, providing new insights into the relationship between MHC genes and T cell selection and maintenance.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a potentially life-threatening illness that can lead to cardiac disorders, digestive issues, and death if left untreated. While it is mostly endemic in 21 Latin American countries, it has been spreading to non-endemic countries, including Europe, due to population mobility and migration from endemic countries. Spain, in particular, has seen a significant increase in Chagas cases due to its high immigration rates from Latin America. From 1997 to 2011, Spain recorded 1729 hospitalizations related to Chagas disease, with a hospitalization rate of 242.8 per 100,000 population in 2011. Being male, aged 45 and 64 years, and having a median hospitalization cost above 3,065 euros were associated with hospitalizations with organ complications. However, Spain currently lacks a nationwide systematic approach towards early detection of T. cruzi, particularly among fertile aged women and relatives from endemic Latin American countries. This increases the risk of underdiagnosing asymptomatic infections and exacerbating health inequalities among immigrants. Therefore, a nationwide systematic approach, including a national surveillance system and screening programs, is necessary to gain extended disease knowledge and evaluate control actions in Spain.
"BlocBuster is a systems-level approach that efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks to accurately segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors and test their associations with given phenotypes. It employs a custom correlation measure for single nucleotide polymorphisms that returns a multi-faceted collection of values that captures genetic heterogeneity. The method was applied to analyze psoriasis and discovered a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5.01x10−16. This pattern was replicated in independent data, demonstrating its robustness. Psoriasis is a complex disease characterized by hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of the epidermis, coupled with marked cutaneous inflammation. Its heritability is estimated at 80%, and it has been linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6. However, less than 20% of genetic heritability can be accounted for by previous discoveries, and many of these loci have not been replicated using independent data, suggesting the existence of genetic heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of this disease. BlocBuster has the potential to discover combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data, thereby transcending the limiting ""small effects"" produced by individual markers examined in isolation."
A large-scale study was conducted to analyze chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) in patients with congenital brain malformations, including agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG), and compare them to controls. The results showed that ACC patients had a higher prevalence of large gene-rich CNVs than CBLH and PMG. Specifically, ACC patients had significantly more rare CNVs over 1 Mb and over 20 genes compared to controls. In contrast, CBLH and PMG patients did not show a significant enrichment of rare CNVs. Exome sequencing revealed a recessive maternally inherited nonsense mutation in the non-deleted allele of NDE1 in an ACC patient with microcephaly and a paternally inherited deletion of 16p13.11 that included NDE1. Six novel CNVs were identified, each in a single patient, that are likely deleterious. This study provides a systematic assessment of CNVs in congenital brain malformations and reveals a much higher prevalence of large gene-rich CNVs in ACC than in CBLH and PMG.
The freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, has a high capacity for regeneration, making it an ideal model to study stereotyped proliferative and transcriptional responses to injury. The Hippo signaling cascade effector, yorkie (yki), plays a key role in restricting early injury responses during planarian regeneration. In yki (RNAi) regenerating animals, wound responses are hyper-activated, leading to increased stem cell proliferation and a prolonged transcriptional wound response program. This results in the de-repression of novel wound-induced genes and an expansion of epidermal and muscle cell populations. Additionally, yki (RNAi) animals have alterations in the sensing of injury size, leading to failures in brain, gut, and midline remodeling and scaling during morphallaxis. These findings suggest that yki functions as a critical regulator of multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning during planarian regeneration.
Exosomes, membrane-encapsulated vesicles that transfer genetic materials between cells, play significant roles in viral infections. In EV71-infected cells, exosomes containing replication-competent EV71 RNA and miR-146a facilitate viral transmission independent of virus-specific receptors. Exosomal viral RNA can be transferred to and replicate in new target cells, while exosomal miR-146a suppresses type I interferon response in the target cell, facilitating viral replication. EV71 infection upregulates exosome secretion, with a 2.4-fold increase in THP-1 and 2.2-fold increase in HT-29 cells. IFN-stimulated gene factors, such as BST-2/tetherin, regulate EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. In vivo studies show that exosomal viral RNA exhibits differential tissue accumulation compared to free virus particles. Exosomes can protect their contents from immune recognition, playing crucial roles in the viral life cycle. Exosomal RNAs, including miRNAs, are implicated in many exosome-mediated biological functions, with a diverse collection of exosomal RNA species, among which miRNAs are the most abundant. Exosomal miRNAs can be taken up by distal tissues or cells, allowing viruses to modulate immune defense of the neighboring cells and facilitate the spread of the virus.
PINK1, a serine/threonine kinase required for mitochondrial homeostasis, is a gene product associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin, another early-onset PD gene product, is thought to function downstream of the PINK1 signaling pathway. A mitochondrial protein, PGAM5, has been identified as a PINK1-binding protein that modulates the PINK1 pathway. Loss of PGAM5 suppresses muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan caused by PINK1 inactivation in Drosophila, but does not affect phenotypes in parkin mutant flies. Ectopic expression of PGAM5 exacerbates PINK1 and parkin phenotypes, suggesting that PGAM5 negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway and acts between PINK1 and Parkin or independently of Parkin downstream of PINK1. PGAM5 is a mitochondrial protein localized at the outer mitochondrial membrane and lacks phosphoglycerate mutase activity. In Drosophila, the PGAM5 gene has two orthologs, dPGAM5 and dPGAM5-2, with dPGAM5 being more similar to hPGAM5. A dPGAM5 null allele, PGAM51, results in longer lifespan, while transgenic expression of dPGAM5 or dPGAM5-2 leads to shorter longevity. Inactivation of the dPGAM5 gene does not cause mitochondrial degeneration but alters mitochondrial morphology, leading to fragmented mitochondria with cristae well-preserved. DPGAM5 is likely to promote the mitochondrial fission process in Drosophila.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, which produces the cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin mycolactone. The immune response to M. ulcerans infection is not yet fully understood, but it is believed that interferon-γ (IFNγ) plays a crucial role in host defense during the early stages of infection. In an experimental BU mouse model, IFNγ knockout mice displayed faster progression of the infection compared to wild-type mice, including faster tissue necrosis and oedema formation, and a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that mice lacking IFNγ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. These findings suggest that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU, and that IFNγ-dependent activation of the bactericidal activity of macrophages helps to contain the infection during its intracellular early stages. Overall, the outcome of an infection with M. ulcerans may depend strongly on cellular immune defense mechanisms, and IFNγ is likely to play an important role both as an element of innate immunity in the early phase of host-pathogen interaction and in the development of protective adaptive cellular immune responses.
A recent study investigates the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria, particularly during hypoxia and reoxygenation, which is associated with major diseases such as heart disease, age-related degenerative conditions, and ischemic syndrome in reperfusion. The study aims to understand the causes of elevated ROS production during anoxia/reoxygenation and develop novel strategies addressing primary events of this clinical phenomenon. The authors propose a new methodology for modeling the mechanism of ROS generation, taking into account all possible redox states formed in the process of electron transport, even for respiratory complex III, by constructing a system of hundreds of differential equations.The study finds that respiratory complex III can persist in two different steady states at the same microenvironmental conditions, characterized by low and high ROS producing modes. Various perturbations, such as temporal anoxia, can induce the transition of the respiratory chain from one steady state to another. Specifically, during temporal anoxia, the respiratory chain switches to a high ROS producing state, which persists after the return to normal oxygen supply, resulting in oxidative stress and cell damage.The researchers validate this prediction experimentally, demonstrating that the methodology could be widely used in systems biology studies. These findings suggest that the recognition of the bistability of complex III operation may enable novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. More importantly, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying elevated ROS production during anoxia/reoxygenation could help develop targeted therapies for various diseases associated with ROS production.
The early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster has been established as a powerful model system for studying the role of genes in pattern formation, with the gap gene network being the first zygotic regulatory tier involved in specifying the position of body segments. This study uses a systems-level approach to investigate the regulatory effect of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) on gap gene expression. Quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein is presented and used to include hkb in gap gene circuit models, which are mathematical models of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from spatial expression data. These models are shown to be consistent with earlier results, and are able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, capturing the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system. This is a significant step towards a better, quantitative understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network. Traditional genetic and molecular approaches have limitations, such as difficulty in studying expression features not specifically affected by a particular mutation, ambiguity in determining whether an interaction is direct or not, and uncertainty in establishing whether known regulatory interactions are sufficient to account for patterning in the wild-type system. This study demonstrates a complementary approach for investigating the patterning function of a particular gene in its wild-type context in a rigorous and quantitative manner. Gap genes, such as hunchback (hb), Krüppel (Kr), giant (gt), and knirps (kni), are involved in the regulation of pair-rule and segment-polarity genes, establishing a segmental pre-pattern of gene expression by gastrulation time. Gap gene expression is regulated by spatial gradients of maternal co-ordinate proteins Bicoid (Bcd), Hb, and Caudal (Cad), and maintained and refined through gap-gap cross-regulation and regulation by the terminal maternal system acting through the terminal gap genes tailless (tll) and huckebein (hkb). This study focuses on hkb and its role in gap gene regulation.
Brucellosis is a significant zoonotic disease that affects animals and humans worldwide, causing major economic losses and health issues. Current therapies for brucellosis are ineffective, and no immunotherapy or biomarker to monitor therapy efficacy is available. The disease is caused by Brucella abortus, which can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals or consumption of contaminated dairy products. Vaccines such as S19 and RB51 have been used to control bovine brucellosis; however, they have limitations, such as antibody interference in serological diagnosis and Rifampicin resistance in RB51.Phage lysates, which are bacteriophages that specifically infect and lyse bacteria, have been explored as an alternative immunotherapeutic agent for brucellosis. Phage lysates have been shown to induce effective immunization and exhibit a protective effect stronger than vaccines produced by heat or chemical inactivation of bacteria. In this study, phage lysates of S19 and RB51 were used to immunize adult cattle affected by brucellosis. The results showed that a single subcutaneous dose of a cocktail lysate (both RL and SL) eliminated live virulent Brucella from brucellosis-affected cattle with plasma level of Brucella-specific 223 bp amplicon undetectable by RT-PCR and blood negative for live Brucella by culture in 3 months post-immunization. This is the first report on minimally invasive monitoring of the efficacy of antibacterial therapy employing plasma RNA specific for live bacteria as a biomarker.In conclusion, phage lysates have shown promising results as an alternative immunotherapeutic agent for brucellosis in cattle. The use of phage lysates as a cocktail of S19 and RB51 has shown to be effective in eliminating live virulent Brucella in brucellosis-affected cattle. Additionally, the use of plasma RNA specific for live bacteria as a biomarker has shown to be a useful tool in monitoring the efficacy of antibacterial therapy in a non-destructive and minimally invasive manner. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the safety and efficacy of phage lysates in larger populations.
In this passage, the authors discuss the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the DNA damage response and cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells. CDKs are important for regulating the cell cycle, but their specific functions in the DNA damage response are not well understood. In mammals, Cdk2 is active throughout S and G2 phases, but is dispensable for survival due to compensation by other CDKs. However, the authors found that replacing wild-type Cdk2 with a mutant version sensitized to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs revealed a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in the DNA damage response. Specifically, transient, selective inhibition of analog-sensitive (AS) Cdk2 after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) enhances cell-killing. In vitro experiments using an ATP analog preferentially used by AS kinases showed that Cdk2as phosphorylated the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome gene product Nbs1, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex required for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling. In vivo, selective inhibition of Cdk2 delayed and diminished Nbs1-Ser432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity. Therefore, the authors identified a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery and uncovered a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage. These findings highlight the importance of CDKs in the DNA damage response and provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by genomic instability.
Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified many genetic loci associated with various traits and diseases, but determining the functional variants and their mechanisms is a challenge. Many GWA signals are located outside exons, suggesting they may lie within regulatory regions. This summary discusses a study that applied the FAIRE method in megakaryocytic and erythroblastoid cell lines to map active regulatory elements at known loci associated with hematological quantitative traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. The study found distinct patterns of open chromatin between the two cell types and identified an open chromatin region at chromosome 7q22.3 in megakaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors the common non-coding sequence variant rs342293 associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing provided evidence that rs342293 is the only putative causative variant in this region. The C- and G-alleles differentially bind the transcription factor EVI1, affecting PIK3CG gene expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein-protein interaction network indicated that PIK3CG is associated with pathways with an established role in platelet membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation. Therefore, rs342293 is the functional common variant at this locus, providing a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding GWA index SNP modulates platelet phenotype.
The mechanisms of action of most pharmacological blockers of voltage-gated ion channels are well understood, but this knowledge is rarely considered when interpreting experimental data. It is often assumed that the effects of blockade are equivalent, regardless of the mechanism of the blocker involved. However, using computer simulations, it has been demonstrated that this assumption may not always be correct. In this study, the blockade of a persistent sodium current (INaP) in respiratory neurons was simulated via two distinct pharmacological mechanisms: pore obstruction mediated by tetrodotoxin and altered inactivation dynamics mediated by riluzole. The reported effects of experimental application of tetrodotoxin and riluzole in respiratory circuits are diverse and seemingly contradictory, leading to considerable debate within the field. The results of the simulations match a wide array of experimental data spanning from the level of isolated pre-BötC neurons to the level of the intact respiratory network and also generate a series of experimentally testable predictions. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block, shows that the effects of INaP block in in vitro preparations are not necessarily equivalent to those in more intact preparations, demonstrates and explains why riluzole application may fail to effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network, and derives the prediction that effective block of INaP by low concentration tetrodotoxin will stop respiratory rhythm generation in the intact respiratory network. These simulations support a critical role for INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and illustrate the importance of considering mechanism when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in tumor metastasis, including in gastric cancer (GC). This piece of writing discusses the regulation and function of miR-218 in GC metastasis. The expression of miR-218 is reduced in metastatic GC, along with the expression of one of its host genes, Slit3. Robo1, one of the Slit receptors, is negatively regulated by miR-218, creating a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR-218 levels eliminate Robo1 repression, activating the Slit-Robo1 pathway and promoting tumor metastasis. The restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest that targeting miR-218 may provide a strategy for blocking tumor metastasis. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for GC, the prognosis for advanced GC with extensive invasion and metastasis remains poor. The metastatic cascade includes various steps such as detachment, migration, local invasion, angiogenesis, intravasation, survival in the circulatory system, extravasation, and regrowth in different organs. In the metastatic cascade, invasion of GC into the surrounding tissue is a crucial early step. However, the mechanisms of invasion have not been fully elucidated. A large number of miRNAs have been implicated in cancer metastasis, including miR-218 in GC. Emerging evidence has revealed that miRNAs play key roles in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, stress resistance, fat metabolism, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. A better understanding of the changes in miRNA expression during GC invasion may lead to a better understanding of GC development, as well as possible improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of advanced GC.
A study on atherosclerosis-prone mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia found that lowering plasma lipoproteins slowed the initial progression of atherosclerotic lesions, then rapidly expanded, and eventually plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Genetic lowering of plasma cholesterol at a critical point in lesion progression prevented the formation of advanced plaques and activated a network of 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. These genes regulate cholesterol-ester accumulation, and a subset of eight genes, including CD36 and PPARA, were found to belong to a regulatory gene network influencing foam-cell formation. Inhibiting PVRL2 and HSDL2 showed promising results in preventing foam-cell formation, suggesting their potential for therapies to prevent advanced plaque formation. The findings emphasize the need for further research into cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes and regulators of foam-cell formation as potential targets for atherosclerosis therapy.
A new high-throughput assay was developed to identify genes affecting the biogenesis of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope, using Escherichia coli as a model. The screen, based on β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity, allowed for the identification of 102 genes of unknown function likely impacting envelope biogenesis. One of these, ElyC (YcbC), was found to play a critical role in the metabolism of the essential lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides. The screening assay should be adaptable to other organisms to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures. This research highlights the importance of understanding envelope assembly in developing new therapies against Gram-negative bacteria, whose envelope's complexity and multilayered structure presents challenges for antimicrobial drug penetration and resistance. The rise of new resistance mechanisms among these organisms further necessitates the discovery of new vulnerabilities in the Gram-negative envelope for antibacterial drug targeting.
A new approach to studying dynamical processes in biology using an integrated view of multivariable dynamics has been developed. The approach uses a semi-supervised learning framework to fuse heterogeneous datasets, as demonstrated using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. This method can be used with other imaging modalities and is a starting point for further data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics. This is important because the need to synthesize data from different observations into coherent multivariable trajectories is a challenge in various fields, and systematic approaches for accomplishing this task have yet to be established. The fusion of heterogeneous datasets from imaging of live and fixed tissues is a non-trivial task, and the problem can be addressed by casting the task of data fusion as a matrix completion problem. This allows for the completion of an image of a fixed embryo or a frame from a live imaging movie by filling in the missing components by estimates informed by the rest of the data. This approach assumes that the multivariable dynamics of the patterning process are both low-dimensional and smooth with respect to the underlying parameters, an assumption that is supported by studies with mathematical models of specific biological systems and by computational analysis of datasets from imaging studies of development. The accuracy of the estimated multivariable dynamics can be assessed using a K-fold validation strategy on the labeled samples. The proposed approach successfully recovers multivariable dynamics from heterogeneous datasets that combine continuous views for part of the state variables and snapshots that report several states without direct temporal information.
Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are important components of snake venoms, particularly in the Viperidae family. They have undergone complex molecular evolution, resulting in a diverse range of SVMPs with various biological activities. These enzymes are classified into three main classes (PI, PII, and PIII) based on their domain constitution. PI SVMPs contain only the metalloproteinase domain, PII SVMPs have an additional disintegrin domain, and PIII SVMPs have a disintegrin-like and a cysteine-rich domain. The non-metalloproteinase domains in PII and PIII SVMPs contain exosites that determine binding to specific targets in the extracellular matrix or plasma membrane of cells. Immunohistochemical observations revealed distinct patterns of distribution of PI and PIII SVMPs in the tissue. PII and PIII SVMPs show a close association with the microvasculature, while PI SVMP has a more widespread distribution in the tissue. In terms of function, SVMPs can induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage. A study compared PI, PII, and PIII SVMPs in terms of tissue localization, their ability to hydrolyze basement membrane components in vivo, and by proteomics analysis of exudates collected in tissue injected with these enzymes. The results showed that PII and PIII enzymes co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules to a higher extent than PI SVMP. The three SVMPs showed a similar pattern of degradation of type IV collagen, supporting the concept that hydrolysis of this component is critical for the destabilization of microvessel structure leading to hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of wound exudate revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs. Higher extent of proteolysis was observed for the PI enzyme regarding several extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, whereas exudates from mice injected with PII and PIII SVMPs had higher amounts of some intracellular proteins. In conclusion, SVMPs have a complex evolutionary history, leading to a diverse range of enzymes with various biological activities. They are classified into three main classes based on their domain constitution, and the non-metalloproteinase domains in PII and PIII SVMPs contain exosites that determine binding to specific targets in the extracellular matrix or plasma membrane of cells. Immunohistochemical observations revealed distinct patterns of distribution of PI and PIII SVMPs in the tissue, and PII and PIII SVMPs show a close association with the microvasculature, while PI SVMP has a more widespread distribution in the tissue. The three SVMPs showed a similar pattern of degradation of type IV collagen, supporting the concept that hydrolysis of this component is critical for the destabilization of microvessel structure leading to hemorrhage. The proteomic analysis revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs, providing novel clues for understanding the mechanisms by which SVMPs induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage.
The homeotic genes in Drosophila melanogaster are aligned on the chromosome in the order of the body segments they affect, with posterior genes repressing anterior ones. This is particularly evident in the case of the abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) genes. Animals lacking Abd-B show ectopic expression of abd-A in the epidermis of the eighth abdominal segment, but not in the central nervous system (CNS), due to repression by a 92 kb noncoding RNA (iab-8 RNA). This RNA produces a microRNA to repress abd-A, but also has a second, redundant repression mechanism acting in cis, likely through transcriptional interference with the abd-A promoter. This iab-8 ncRNA is part of a 90 kb long transcription unit with a likely start site within the iab-8 regulatory region. In the CNS, the iab-8 RNA represses abd-A expression through both the miR-iab-8 microRNA and transcriptional interference. Any genotype lacking both the iab-8 RNA and miR-iab-8 miRNA shows strong ABD-A misexpression in the CNS of PS13. The iab-8 RNA can only repress the copy of abd-A on the chromosome from which it is transcribed, and this repression is termed transcriptional interference.
"Focal seizures, which are instances of disruptive brain activity arising from localized abnormalities, are a major focus in epilepsy management. The identification of the precise origin of a given patient's focal seizures is crucial for effective clinical management. While various clinical evidence can point to the nature and site of the origin, data recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) or the invasive alternative of electrocorticography (ECoG) are particularly critical. Previous clinical studies suggest that focal seizures could have different onset mechanisms. Relatedly, there is a clear heterogeneity in clinical outcomes: only a subset of patients responds to medications, or surgical removal of the presumed epileptic focus. In terms of the appearance and morphology of focal seizure activity, generally two types of common onset patterns are reported: The low amplitude fast (LAF) activity, characterized by oscillations in the beta to gamma range of initially low amplitude that slowly increases as the seizure progresses; and the high amplitude slow (HAS) activity, which is generally described as a slower oscillation below the alpha range with a high amplitude at onset. Depending on the study and subtype of epilepsy, finer distinctions in the onset pattern have been characterized, and different quantitative measures have been used to categorize the onset patterns. Importantly, the LAF pattern is associated with a good surgical outcome when removed, while the HAS pattern may be associated with a worse surgural outcome.A recent computational study used a previously established model of neocortical tissue to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns. The researchers validated the model using clinical recordings of focal seizures and reproduced the two onset patterns in their most defining properties in the model. They found that the two patterns are associated with different mechanisms at the spatial scale of a single ECoG electrode. The LAF onset is initiated by independent patches of localized activity, which slowly invade the surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, the HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. Such a global transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of the ""healthy"" surrounding tissue, which by itself does not generate seizures but can support seizure activity when incited. The model also demonstrates how changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated using active stimulation, suggesting that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the seizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern as well as in the surgical outcome."
Flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, have a unique reproductive system that evolved around 180-140 million years ago to adapt to various ecological environments. These plants have a haploid male gametophyte that is reduced to a three-cellular pollen grain and pollen tube, which can be transported over long distances and grow inside female reproductive tissues. The sperm cells of flowering plants are non-motile and are transported to the female gametes via the pollen tube. Upon arrival at the female gametes, two sperm cells are discharged into the receptive synergid cell to execute double fertilization.Recent studies have identified the first molecular players involved in inter-gametophyte signaling to attract pollen tubes and to arrest their growth. However, the physiological mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and thus sperm discharge remained elusive. A study published in the journal Science identified polymorphic defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins ZmES1-4 from maize that are exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte. These proteins accumulate in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells and are released during the fertilization process. ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner. Pollen tube plasma membrane depolarization, which occurs immediately after ZmES4 application, as well as channel blocker experiments, suggest a role of K+-influx in the pollen tube rupture mechanism. The intrinsic rectifying K+ channel KZM1 was discovered as a direct target of ZmES4. Following ZmES4 application, KZM1 opens at physiological membrane potentials and closes after wash-out. Vesicles containing ZmES4 are released from the synergid cells upon male-female gametophyte signaling. Subsequent interaction between ZmES4 and KZM1 results in channel opening and K+ influx, leading to water uptake and culminating in osmotic tube burst. The species-preferential activity of polymorphic ZmES4 indicates that the mechanism described represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants.
Oncolytic viruses that specifically target and kill tumor cells are a promising approach in cancer therapy. A significant challenge is effectively targeting disseminated tumors in the body. A study led by De Giovanni et al. retargeted the herpes simplex virus (HSV) to the HER-2 oncoprotein, which is overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers. The modified HSV, R-LM249, exclusively infects and kills tumor cells expressing high levels of human HER-2, leaving healthy cells unharmed.The researchers tested the efficacy of systemically injected R-LM249 against disseminated tumors in mouse models that mimic tumor spread to the peritoneum in women. The results showed that intraperitoneal administration of R-LM249 strongly inhibited carcinomatosis, resulting in 60% of mice free from peritoneal diffusion and a 95% reduction in the total weight of neoplastic nodules. Intraperitoneal metastases of HER-2+ breast cells were also reduced. Furthermore, brain metastases were also reduced upon i.p. administration of R-LM249.Overall, the study demonstrated that the HER-2-redirected oncolytic HSV effectively reduced the growth of ovarian and breast carcinoma disseminated to the peritoneal cavity. This novel therapy has the potential to improve the treatment of disseminated tumors in women with ovarian and breast cancers. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in clinical trials and to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of this approach.
Centrosome duplication occurs once per cell cycle and is crucial for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance. This process is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), and a study has identified Sfi1, a conserved centrosome component, as the first Cdk substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. Reducing Cdk1 phosphorylation by changing Sfi1 phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separating duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and premature SPB reduplication during mitosis. These cells also display defects in bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. Additionally, the protein phosphatase Cdc14 has the opposite role of activating licensing, likely via dephosphorylation of Sfi1. Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 promotes SPB separation for spindle formation and prevents premature SPB duplication.
The study conducted by Sato and colleagues investigates the role of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr during HIV-1 infection in vivo. The researchers used a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model infected with wild-type and vpr-deficient HIV-1. The findings suggest that Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating CCR5-tropic HIV-1 propagation during acute infection by utilizing CCR5+ proliferating CD4+ T cells including Tregs.Vpr is known to induce G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and previous in vitro studies have reported that vpr-deficient HIV-1 is less replicative. However, the significance and the precise role of Vpr in vivo remain unclear. The study aimed to characterize the profile of human CD4+ T cell subsets, including Tns, Tms, and Tregs, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from HIV-1-negative healthy donors and in the spleen of humanized mice. The results showed that Tregs are more actively cycling in vivo than the other T cell subsets and have a higher expression level of CCR5, the HIV-1 coreceptor, making them more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr during acute HIV-1 infection.Furthermore, the study found that HIV-1 infection decreases Tregs in humanized mice, resulting in immune activation. Additionally, Vpr enhances virus dissemination and induces Treg depletion leading to immune activation in humanized mice. The distribution of HIV-1-infected cells during acute infection showed that Tregs were more positive for p24, the HIV-1 antigen, than Tm and Tn in both WT HIV-1-infected and HIV-1Δvpr-infected mice, and the percentage of p24+ Tregs in WT HIV-1-infected mice was significantly higher than that in HIV-1Δvpr-infected mice. These findings suggest that Tregs were highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection, produced large amounts of the virus with Vpr responsible for augmenting this production.In conclusion, the study demonstrates the crucial role of Vpr in accelerating CCR5-tropic HIV-1 propagation during acute infection by utilizing CCR5+ proliferating CD4+ T cells including Tregs in vivo. The findings suggest that Vpr-mediated Treg depletion leads to immune activation, thereby augmenting viral propagation in vivo.
Vivax malaria, caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite, is the second most prevalent form of human malaria, affecting around 390 million people annually. Although it was eliminated in South Korea in the 1970s, it re-emerged in 1993. To understand and control the transmission of P. vivax in South Korea, it is important to analyze the genetic structure of the parasite population. In this study, microsatellite DNA markers of P. vivax from 163 South Korean isolates collected from 1994 to 2008 were analyzed. The analysis of linkage disequilibrium, genetic differentiation, and population structure showed a gradual decrease in linkage disequilibrium levels, while the levels of genetic differentiation between successive years and analysis of the population structure based on the Bayesian approach suggested that a drastic genetic change occurred in the South Korean population during 2002 and 2003. The results suggest the continual introduction of P. vivax into South Korea through other parasite population sources, potentially from North Korea. Molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA of the P. vivax population is effective for assessing the population structure and temporal dynamics of parasite transmission, which can assist in the elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas.
The enhancement of transcription by a splicing-competent intron is a conserved feature in eukaryotes, but the molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully understood. A study using strand-specific transcription run-on (TRO) analysis found that the transcription of mRNA is favored over upstream anti-sense transcripts (uaRNA) initiating from the promoter in the presence of an intron. Mutation of either the 5′ or 3′ splice site resulted in the reversal of promoter directionality, indicating that the entire splicing-competent intron regulates transcription directionality. ChIP analysis revealed the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region in the presence of an intron, and this recruitment was adversely affected by the removal of the intron or mutation of splice sites. The study also found that gene looping is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of an intron-containing gene, and this looping is dependent on the presence of a splicing-competent intron. The authors propose that the intron-dependent gene looping places terminator-bound factors in the vicinity of the promoter region for termination of the promoter-initiated upstream antisense transcription, thereby conferring promoter directionality. Introns have been enigmatic in their precise physiological role in biological systems, but one of their evolutionarily conserved functions in eukaryotes is in the regulation of mRNA output of a gene. The promoter-proximal introns often stimulate transcription of genes that harbor them in a phenomenon called ‘intron-mediated enhancement of transcription’ (IME). Despite the ubiquity of IME, the molecular mechanism underlying the phenomenon remains elusive. Intron-containing genes contribute nearly 28% of mRNA produced in yeast cells, and the intron-mediated enhancement of transcription involves gene looping, which is the physical interaction of the promoter and terminator regions of a gene in a transcription-dependent manner.
A single nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of the IGF2 gene in pigs leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 in skeletal muscle, resulting in major effects on muscle growth, heart size, and fat deposition. The repressor for this gene, ZBED6, was found to be a previously unknown protein specifically in placental mammals and derived from an exapted DNA transposon. ZBED6 affects Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. The protein has a high conservation level in placental mammals and broad tissue distribution with many target genes that have essential biological functions. Strong selection for lean growth in domestic pigs during the last 60 years has resulted in increased muscle growth and reduced fat deposition, with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to the IGF2 gene. The favorable IGF2 allele has undergone a massive selective sweep and is close to fixation in pig populations used for meat production. The IGF2 mutation up-regulates expression of an IGF2 antisense noncoding transcript with hitherto unknown function. The repressor, ZBED6, binds to its target site only when it is unmethylated, and ZBED6 takes part in the regulation of genes associated with basal functions in placental mammals.
"The RNA editing process, which alters hereditary information by introducing differences between RNA and its corresponding DNA sequence, has been significantly understood through Next Generation Sequencing technology. However, several issues regarding the strategies to accurately delineate the editome, the mechanism by which its profile is maintained, and its evolutionary and functional relevance remain unresolved. This article presents an accurate and quantitative profile of the RNA editome for rhesus macaque, a close relative of human, by combining genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal. The study identified 31,250 editing sites, of which 99.8% are A-to-G transitions, and verified 96.6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97.5% of randomly selected sites in non-coding regions. The findings suggest that RNA editing is a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution and provides an informative framework for further understanding RNA editing in human. The study complements the ""continuous probing"" model, which postulates tinkering-based origination of a small proportion of functional editing sites. The macaque editome highlights RNA editing as a crucial regulatory step shaped by purifying selection, providing an essential evolutionary context to understand RNA-editing regulation in human."
A series of studies have explored the optimal population decoding of sensory responses in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks. These tasks involve integrating noisy neural responses into a more reliable representation of the likelihood that certain stimuli evoked the observed responses. An ideal observer should be able to evaluate likelihood with high precision and only consider the likelihood of the two relevant stimuli involved in the discrimination task. However, a new perceptual bias has been reported, suggesting that observers read out the likelihood representation with low precision during grating spatial frequency discrimination tasks. This bias indicates that observers evaluate likelihoods of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives.Perceptual decisions in visual tasks rely on information encoded in neural responses in primary visual cortex (V1). However, this information may not be readily available to higher levels of the visual system because it is distributed across entire populations of neurons. Each neuron's reliability is limited by intrinsic response variability, and its relevance strongly depends on the perceptual task at hand. To form accurate perceptual judgements, the brain needs to pool sensory responses efficiently, decoding the population response into a reliable decision variable. Studies have shown that the visual system uses a flexible precision pooling scheme or a crude, unselective pooling scheme, depending on the reliability and relevance of sensory responses to the task at hand. However, it remains unclear why results differ across studies, indicating that neural decision making is not fully understood.Formally, optimal decoding requires evaluating neural responses probabilistically by computing the log likelihood function, which captures the likelihood that specific stimuli gave rise to the observed population response. Subsequently, the likelihood function must be read out and linked to a decision variable. In two-alternative discrimination tasks, an optimal decoder calculates a ratio of likelihoods by reading out the likelihood function at two specific locations that correspond to the two possible stimulus alternatives. However, it remains unclear to what extent the likelihood ratio can be computed with arbitrary high precision. A failure to sample the likelihood representation with high precision may account for the suboptimal unselective pooling reported previously.A new perceptual bias has been estimated to understand the width of the likelihood read-out functions involved in two-alternative pattern detection and discrimination tasks. The study found that filtered noise backgrounds dramatically alter the perception of grating spatial frequency. Embedding a grating in low-pass filtered noise causes the perceived spatial frequency of the grating to decrease, while high-pass filtered noise increases perceived grating spatial frequency. A population code model is proposed, consisting of a physiologically inspired V1 encoding front-end followed by a decoding stage. By simultaneously modeling grating detectability and discriminability, the study was able to estimate both the amount of sensory information encoded in the V1 population response and the extent to which this information is used to maximize performance. The findings suggest that observers failed to sample the likelihood function at the appropriate locations with arbitrary high precision, indicating that precision pooling was not adopted in the tasks.
PiRNAs in C. elegans are small non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. Each piRNA represents a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit, derived from a 21 nucleotide sequence and an upstream motif with limited genomic context. This motif is necessary for independent expression of a germline-enriched, Piwi-dependent piRNA. A single nucleotide position within this motif directs differential germline enrichment, with over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs being preferentially expressed in male or female germlines. These piRNAs are expressed autonomously, with more than 15,000 unique piRNA sequences encoded in the genome. This number is similar to the number of mRNA coding genes in the C. elegans genome, indicating the significance of piRNAs in this organism.
Brucella species, which cause the disease brucellosis in animals and humans, replicate within host cells in specialized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles. However, the mechanisms by which the bacteria acquire ER-derived membrane and establish a replication niche are not well understood. In a study by Zhang et al., the authors investigated the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and host factor Yip1A in Brucella abortus replication. The UPR is a cellular stress response that helps restore ER homeostasis, and it is composed of three pathways: IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. Zhang et al. found that B. abortus preferentially activates the IRE1 pathway, leading to the upregulation of COPII vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D. These components are involved in the formation of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites (ERES), where functional ERES and COPII vesicles are required for B. abortus replication. Through immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, the authors identified Yip1A, a 257 amino acid multi-pass membrane protein, as a host factor that interacts with pIRE1 in a UPR-dependent manner. Yip1A localizes to ERES, binds to Sec23 and Sec24, and is involved in COPII vesicle budding. Knockdown of Yip1A diminished the increase in pIRE1 and reduced the splicing of XBP1 mRNA and the amount of spliced-XBP1 protein during Tm treatment. Additionally, Yip1A-knockdown cells showed little upregulation of downstream targets Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D during B. abortus infection. The localization of IRE1 was not affected by Yip1A-knockdown, but the deficiency in IRE1 phosphorylation caused by Yip1A-knockdown may be attributed to the inability of IRE1 to form oligomers. Overall, the study suggests that Yip1A is a pivotal host factor for B. abortus to establish its ER-derived safe replication niche by regulating the activation of IRE1 via high-order assembly of IRE1 molecules under the UPR condition.
Tombusviruses, including tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV), rely on the subversion of host factors and the retargeting of cellular pathways to support their replication. The researchers discovered that TBSV and CIRV recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the large viral replication compartment, and the kinase function of Vps34 is critical for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI (3) P phosphoinositide is utilized by TBSV for building the replication compartment. Overexpression of PI (3) P phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibited TBSV replication on the peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on the mitochondrial membranes. The direct interaction between the p33 replication protein and Vps34p is needed for the biogenesis of the replication compartments. The researchers concluded that Vps34 and PI (3) P are needed for providing the optimal microenvironment for the replication of the peroxisomal TBSV and the mitochondrial CIRV. Vps34 and PI (3) P play multiple roles in human diseases, such as numerous forms of cancer, heart problems, neurodegeneration, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Many DNA and RNA viruses are influenced by the PI3K signaling pathway, and subversion of Vps34 PI3K and PI (3) P could be widespread among viruses. The accumulation of PI (3) P helps the recruitment of its numerous protein effectors, and many intracellular microbes and parasites exploit the cellular PI (3) P to establish infections. The SopB effector of the Salmonella bacterium recruits Vps34 to the bacteria-containing vacuole, leading to enrichment of PI (3) P and maturation of the bacteria-containing vacuole. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Phytophtora, and Plasmodium parasites also exploit PI (3) P to regulate endosomal functions. In summary, Vps34 and PI (3) P play central roles in microbe-host intracellular interactions and are hijacked by tombusviruses to create a favorable environment for their replication.
This study conducted in Iquitos, Peru, between 2011 and 2015, aimed to compare different methods of transmitting dengue virus (DENV) from humans to mosquitoes for a field-based epidemiological study. The study involved 58 participants who were 5 years and older with 5 or fewer days of fever. The three feeding methods compared were direct feeding, indirect feeding with EDTA-treated blood, and indirect feeding with no additive. The study found that infection rates were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on blood with no additive compared to direct and indirect-EDTA feeding. However, dissemination rates were similar across all feeding methods. The study also found no differences in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. The study highlights the importance of developing appropriate methods to quantify virus transmission between humans and mosquitoes for mosquito-borne viruses such as DENV, chikungunya, and Zika, which have significant public health impact.
The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans was used to investigate the causes of variability in sensitivity to anti-neoplastic drugs that target topoisomerase II. It was found that wild strains of C. elegans vary in their sensitivity to these drugs, with a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase II (TOP-2) being responsible for this variation. This residue is conserved from yeast to humans and influences cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines. This finding explains why hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ are differentially affected by various poisons and demonstrates the utility of C. elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses. Antineoplastic regimens used to treat cancer are often associated with poor prognoses and severe side effects. Ideally, antineoplastic regimens can be tailored to an individual patient based on various genetic markers to maximize therapeutic effectiveness and minimize unwanted side effects. However, the predictive power of identified genetic variants can be inconsistent due to biases in the sampled population and other limitations of clinical genome-wide association studies. The study of model organisms, such as C. elegans, can help identify variants that predict patient outcomes to antineoplastic compounds. In this study, C. elegans was used to identify a major-effect QTL for etoposide resistance on chromosome II at 11.83 Mb, which explained 27% of the phenotypic variance among the recombinant lines. This QTL was confirmed using homozygous reciprocal near-isogenic lines and was found to contain 90 genes, 68 of which contain variation between the parental strains. Of these genes, the top-2 gene, which encodes a topoisomerase II enzyme that is homologous to the two human isoforms of topoisomerase II, was prioritized because topoisomerase II enzymes are the cellular targets for etoposide. Genetic variation present in the top-2 gene was found to contribute to differential etoposide sensitivity, with the Bristol top-2 allele underlies etoposide resistance. This study highlights the power of using C. elegans natural genetic variation to identify mechanisms of drug susceptibility in human cells that could inform human health decisions based on genetic information.
"A study was conducted to understand the genetics of lifespan determination in mammals, specifically focusing on rodents, as most research has been done on short-lived animals and it is unclear if these insights can be transferred to long-lived mammals like humans. The study found that some African mole-rats have life expectancies multiple times higher than similar-sized and phylogenetically closely related rodents. To gain new insights, genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species were obtained and scanned for positively selected genes (PSGs) associated with the evolution of enhanced longevity. The set of 250 identified PSGs showed an expression pattern in the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats that fits the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. The PSGs were found to be enriched for genes known to be related to aging, including ""cellular respiration,"" ""metal ion homeostasis,"" and functional terms associated with processes regulated by the mTOR pathway: translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Remarkably, among PSGs are RHEB, a regulator of mTOR, and IGF1, both central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as genes yet unknown to be aging-associated but representing convincing functional candidates. The study concludes that the results provide a meaningful resource for follow-up studies to mechanistically link identified genes and amino acids under positive selection to aging and lifespan determination."
A new Aedes albopictus transinfection, ARwP-M, was generated by introducing wMel Wolbachia in the ARwP line which had been established previously by replacing wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia with the wPip strain. This new transinfection showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of wMel and wPip Wolbachia. Survival, female fecundity, and egg fertility did not differ between the three Ae. albopictus lines (ARwP-M, ARwP, and SANG). ARwP-M males induced a level of sterility significantly higher than that expected for an equal mating competitiveness when competing with SANG males for SANG females. The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was about 15 fold higher than in ARwP, mostly due to the wMel infection. This feature corresponded to a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses with respect to ARwP females. Results regarding Zika virus did not highlight significant differences between ARwP-M and ARwP. However, none of the tested ARwP-M females was capable at transmitting ZIKV. These findings are expected to promote the exploitation of Wolbachia to suppress the wild-type Ae. albopictus populations. These strategies have the potential to significantly affect mosquito populations, leading to a diminished risk that they may support diseases. Despite control measures applied worldwide over decades, arthropod-borne diseases continue to pose a constant threat to human and domestic animal health. Human-induced changes in the environment, climate change, passive transportation and acquisition of resistance to insecticides by the vectors are contributing to a dramatic re-emergence of harmful viruses such as dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV) transmitted by mosquitoes.
The text discusses the use of protein structures and their interactions to understand the behavior of proteins in a cellular context. Proteins often interact with other molecules to form complexes or transmit signals. High-resolution 3D structures of these interactions, collected in the Protein Data Bank, can reveal important information about the forces holding the proteins together and the potential disruptibility of the interface. The text describes two main classes of protein-protein interfaces: domain-domain interfaces, which are large and stable, and interfaces between a globular domain and a peptide stretch, which are smaller and often transient, making them ideal for signalling networks. The text also discusses the use of computational tools to predict and understand these domain-motif interactions (DMIs), including the use of sequence-based motif discovery algorithms and tools that search 3D structures for sites that may bind a given motif. The text highlights the importance of high-resolution 3D structures in understanding the function and fast-evolving profiles of DMIs, and the potential of these interactions as drug targets.
Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a disorder associated with growth failure, micronutrient malabsorption, and impaired responses to oral vaccines in disadvantaged populations, particularly children. A study of 49 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia used confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of small intestinal biopsies to define cellular mechanisms of impaired barrier function and explore protective mechanisms. The study found virtually ubiquitous small intestinal damage in CLE images, with epithelial defects predominantly at villi tips corresponding to leakage seen in vivo. Circulating LPS was correlated with cell shedding events and inversely with GLP-2, a protective peptide. Zinc uptake was attenuated in 64% of individuals, reduced by HIV, and positively correlated with GLP-2. Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins. The study suggests that confocal endomicroscopy, claudin 4 immunostaining, and histology can identify epithelial defects, sites of bacterial translocation, and the role of GLP-2 and other protective peptides in mucosal protection in EE. Further elucidation of these pathways is of considerable importance for developing strategies to prevent and treat EE.
Superinfection Exclusion (SIE) is a phenomenon where a pre-existing virus, referred to as the primary invader, prevents secondary infections by the same or closely related viruses, known as superinfectors, at the cellular and/or organismal levels. This phenomenon has been observed in many human and animal pathogenic viruses, including HIV, HCV, WNV, and VSV, as well as large double-stranded DNA viruses like herpesviruses and poxviruses. SIE has also been documented in plant viruses, such as citrus tristeza virus and tobacco mosaic virus, and is thought to be mechanistically related to the cross protection phenomenon observed in virus-infected plants. SIE is primarily a virus-driven phenomenon, with one or a few virus-encoded proteins playing a critical role and little involvement of host cell components. In the case of turnip crinkle virus (TCV), SIE is exclusively determined by p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by this virus. P28 expressed from a TCV replicon exerts strong SIE to a different TCV replicon, and this repressive activity can be recapitulated by transiently expressing p28. P28 forms multimeric intracellular inclusions that inactivate p28 translated from superinfectors, thereby denying superinfectors the chance to replicate. This novel, simple mechanism of SIE could prove to be applicable to many other viruses and predicts a novel target for antiviral therapy.
In a study to test the duration of protection provided by the Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase (TS) gene using different delivery methods, it was found that while TS DNA vaccines induced robust TS-specific IFN-γ responses and protected mice against lethal challenge in the short term, long-term protection was not reported. The goal of the study was to investigate whether the co-administration of a plasmid encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) could improve the duration of protection achieved through genetic vaccination with pTS alone. Mice immunized with pTS alone developed robust TS-specific IFN-γ responses and survived a lethal challenge given within the first 3 months following immunization. However, mice vaccinated with both pTS and pIL-15 challenged 6 months post-vaccination were significantly more protected against lethal T. cruzi challenges than mice vaccinated with pTS alone (P<0.05). Improved protection correlated with significantly higher numbers of TS-specific IFN-γ producing total and CD8+ T cells detected 6 months post immunization. The addition of pIL-15 during genetic vaccination greatly improved long-term T cell survival, memory T cell expansion, and long-term protection against the important human parasite, T. cruzi. This is significant because over 11 million individuals are infected worldwide with T. cruzi, and current chemotherapies have limited effectiveness in chronic infection and are often poorly tolerated. A safe and effective vaccine is needed to curb the spread of Chagas disease and reduce its burden on public health.
The protein kinase TbPLK in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei plays crucial roles in basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. The level of TbPLK protein is tightly controlled through a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase composed of Cullin4, the DNA damage-binding protein 1 homolog TbDDB1, and a WD40-repeat protein WDR1. WDR1 interacts with the PEST motif in TbPLK via its C-terminal domain and binds to TbDDB1 via its N-terminal WD40 motif, promoting TbPLK degradation in the basal body and the bilobe after the G1/S cell cycle transition. This mechanism ensures proper bilobe duplication, basal body separation, and flagellum-cell body adhesion. TbPLK contains two potential degradation motifs, putative D-boxes and a putative PEST motif, and its degradation depends on both these motifs. APC/C is involved in TbPLK degradation, but it is not the sole and major ubiquitin ligase responsible for TbPLK degradation. WDR1, a TbPLK-interacting protein, localizes to the basal body and the bilobe region during S phase and interacts with TbPLK via its C-terminal domain. WDR1 forms a complex with TbCUL4 but not other Cullins, suggesting that WDR1 specifically forms a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex with TbCUL4, TbDDB1, and TbPLK, named CRL4WDR1, which mediates TbPLK degradation. Knockdown of WDR1 results in a severe growth defect and disrupted flagellum-cell body adhesion, suggesting that WDR1 is essential for cell proliferation and proper flagellum attachment in the procyclic form.
The DExD/H box RNA helicases, such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), are important components of the innate immune system. Here, a study reveals the significant role of the heterosomal isoforms of the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3 in the immune system. Mice lacking DDX3X during hematopoiesis showed altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen, and a significant inability to combat Listeria monocytogenes infection. The alterations in innate immune responses resulted from decreased effector cell availability and function and a sex-dependent impairment of cytokine synthesis. DDX3X is a regulator of IFN-I transcription in cells infected with viruses or with Listeria monocytogenes. DDX3X is implicated in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and tumorigenesis. Deletion of DDX3X in all embryonic tissues causes the death of male embryos at an early postimplantation stage. DDX3X and DDX3Y share around 90% homology, with DDX3Y protein expression originally thought to be confined to the male germline. However, more recent proteomic databases list DDX3Y in cells of the immune system, including T-cells, B-cells, and NK-cells, suggesting that DDX3 and DDX3Y are functionally redundant. The heterosomal origin of the DDX3 isoforms suggests they may contribute to sex-related differences in immunity to microbes, the ability to resolve inflammation and the propensity to develop autoinflammatory syndromes. DDX3X may promote replication of viruses like HIV or HCV, but it also stimulates the production of antiviral IFN-I. Antimicrobial pathways leading to IFN-I synthesis converge at two related S/T kinases, TBK1 and IKKε. DDX3X interacts with TBK1 and serves as its substrate and interacts with IKKε, the other non-canonical IKK kinase responsible for phosphorylation and activation of the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 that control Ifnb gene transcription. In addition to its function downstream of TBK1/IKKε, DDX3X reportedly associates with the adaptor protein MAVS which localizes upstream of TBK1 and IKKε and supports signal transduction by the two DExH helicases RIG-I and MDA-5. In this context, DDX3X was shown to sense viral RNA and to supplement the function of RIG-I and MDA-5 in the early phase of infection. Strengthening its importance for antiviral immunity, a recent report lists DDX3X among genes conferring intrinsic antiviral immunity to stem cells.
A biophysical model of receptor potential generation in male moth olfactory receptor neurons is presented, focusing on post-effector processes involving second messengers, ionic channels, and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. The model captures the main features of the dose-response curves and reproduces the second messenger kinetics. It suggests that two types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pheromone concentrations. ORNs are essential for odor molecule recognition, and modeling has contributed significantly to understanding their transduction cascade. The model presented here focuses on post-effector processes in male moth pheromone ORNs, taking advantage of modeling studies in both moths and vertebrates. It aims to fit experimental dose-response curves and address the functional roles of various currents and mechanisms behind the characteristics of concentration-response curves. A global qualitative model of pheromone transduction is developed based on experimental results, assumptions, and known facts. Computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and feedback control assessments are carried out to determine parameter values, fit experimental curves, and understand the system's behavior. The results suggest the coexistence of two signaling pathways in both pheromonal and non-pheromonal ORNs, one ionotropic and the other metabotropic, both gating a cationic channel. The ionotropic signal is rapid and transient, while the metabotropic signal is sensitive and prolonged, with different intensities and timings. The ionotropic pathway has lower energetic cost and could explain the high speed of response in ORNs and moths.
The study investigates the interaction between chromatin status and p53RE context in the transactivation response of p53, a tumor suppressor protein that responds to DNA damage and cellular stress signals. The researchers used a well-characterized lymphoblastoid cell-culture exposure model system and ENCODE data to analyze genome-wide changes in p53 binding, H3K4me3, gene expression, and DNase I hypersensitivity (DNase-seq) induced by the DNA-damaging, chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DXR) in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). The results showed inverse correlations between p53 occupancy and both chromatin accessibility and evolutionary conservation. The study also revealed that p53RE sequence content is highly correlated with genomic occupancy and that chromatin state context strongly modulates the relationship between p53 occupancy level and changes in gene expression. The interaction between these features appears to have been shaped by evolutionary selective pressure, likely driven by transposable elements. The findings suggest the importance of considering the interactions of sequence content and epigenetic factors in interpreting p53-mediated stress responses.
Synthetic biology aims to design and reengineer biological systems, with efforts mainly focused on transcriptional circuits due to limited understanding of signaling circuits' systems dynamics and experimental challenges. However, bacterial two-component signaling systems offer a rich diversity of sensory systems that can be reengineered through synthetic biology. A study focused on a specific motif in two-component signaling, where a single histidine kinase (HK) phosphotransfers reversibly to two separate output response regulator (RR) proteins, found that this motif not only allows rapid signal termination but also implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. Mathematical conditions on system parameters were identified, necessary for sigmoidal signal-response relationships, and key parameters that control threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve were defined. In vitro reconstitution of the one HK-two RR motif found in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway confirmed these findings. The study concludes that the one HK-two RR motif allows bacteria and yeast to implement tunable switch-like signal processing and provides an ideal basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications. This research contributes to understanding the signal-response relationship in two-component systems and facilitates the design of synthetic threshold devices using two-component signaling proteins.
In both bacteria and humans, individual cells within isogenic populations can show significant variation in stress tolerance, but the nature of this heterogeneity is unclear. To investigate this, a study used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress. The study aimed to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. By leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, the study uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response, in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Overall, the study suggests that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells. The variation in stress tolerance can be traced to heterogeneous expression of defense genes, and in some cases, such variation is intrinsic to the gene promoter, producing stochastic transcriptional bursts. Extrinsic variation in the cellular system, such as activation of the broader upstream signaling response or transition through other physiological states, likely plays an important role. Several studies have shown that variation in stress tolerance can be linked to the Environmental Stress Response (ESR), a common transcriptomic response triggered by diverse stresses, which includes induced expression of defense genes and repression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and factors involved in ribosome biogenesis. Activation of the ESR after mild stress can impart increased tolerance to subsequent stress, while increased expression of the iESR genes is coupled to reduced expression of RP and RiBi genes in the repressed-Environmental Stress Response gene set. Cell-to-cell variation in Msn2 activation could explain the heterogeneity in stress tolerance in an actively growing culture.
African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei and transmitted through the tsetse fly. The parasite can infect various organs and tissues, including the male reproductive system. A recent study found that in mice, T. brucei accumulates in the male reproductive system, specifically in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis. However, the parasites are not located in immune-privileged sites and are exposed to a strong immune response. This finding suggests the potential use of fine needle aspiration cytology as a complementary diagnostic tool for Animal African Trypanosomiasis.Human African Trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects both humans and animals, causing significant pathology and limiting livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease has two sub-species, T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense, with T. b. gambiense being the most prevalent and responsible for approximately 97% of the cases. Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT), also known as nagana, is primarily caused by T. congolense and T. vivax, while T. b. evansi and T. brucei subspecies play a minor role. AAT is transmitted cyclically by tsetse flies, while T. b. evansi is transmitted mechanically by hematophagous biting flies and T. equiperdum is sexually transmitted.A study in mice infected with T. b. brucei showed that parasites circulate in blood, lymph, and are present in interstitial space of several organs and tissues, including adipose tissue, skin, and testis. The presence of replicating T. b. brucei parasites in the male reproductive organs has also been described in other animals such as rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. A recent study proposed that the accumulation of T. b. brucei in the male reproductive organs could protect parasites from the immune system and drugs.The male reproductive system has specialized tissue barriers, such as blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers, that maintain sperm inaccessible to the immune system. A disruption of these barriers generates a foreign body reaction/granuloma and commonly leads to infertility. Reproductive organs are often affected in trypanosomiasis in both male and female animals. In male animals infected with T. b. brucei, testis show multiple lesions, including scrotal dermatitis, orchitis, and periorchitis, resulting in poor quality semen.In conclusion, T. brucei accumulates in the male reproductive organs of mice, including the testis and epididymis, in niches that are not protected by the blood-testis, nor blood-epididymis barriers, leading to severe inflammation and disruption of both barriers. The detection of parasites in the male reproductive organs opens the possibility of using fine needle aspiration cytology as a complementary diagnostic tool for Animal African Trypanosomiasis. Reproductive health is affected in both humans and animals infected with T. b. gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense, leading to impotence, gynecomastia, infertility, or sterility in men and irregular estrous cycle, infertility, or sterility in women. Reproductive health disorders can also affect fetal development in pregnant women and animals infected with trypanosomiasis.
Chemosensation is critical for the survival of most organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster, and is mediated by large families of chemoreceptor proteins. The expression of chemoreceptor genes must be tuned appropriately to changes in the chemical environment. A study was conducted to understand the regulation of chemoreceptor genes in D. melanogaster, focusing on genes that are clustered in the genome. The study found that these genes undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Exposure of flies to odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes, and genes are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex members. The chemosensory subgenome is structured as a mosaic of small modules of highly correlated transcripts, enabling fine tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions. These findings have implications for the understanding of the evolution and function of chemosensory systems in animals.
"Human trisomies, which result from abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction during maternal meiosis I or II, can be better understood by studying the meiotic recombination process in human females. Immunofluorescence methodology can be used to analyze crossover-associated proteins, such as MLH1, in human fetal oocytes to identify abnormal crossover configurations and characterize genome-wide levels of recombination in the human female. Studies have shown that the number of MLH1 foci is lower than predicted, but their localization pattern conforms to that expected for a crossover-associated protein. Observations also provide evidence for the presence of ""vulnerable"" crossover configurations in the fetal oocyte, which can lead to nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. Meiotic errors, particularly in the first meiotic division, are a significant cause of chromosome abnormalities in humans, with most abnormalities originating in the oocyte. Disturbances in meiotic recombination have been linked to various human trisomies, with most trisomies associated with reductions in recombination and alterations in the location of crossover events. It is hypothesized that there is a two-step process linking aberrant meiotic recombination and meiotic nondisjunction, with achiasmate homologous chromosomes or homologous chromosomes with sub-optimally located exchanges being a large proportion, if not a majority, of human trisomies. Despite advancing maternal age being the most important risk factor for meiotic nondisjunction, these meiotic recombination abnormalities occur in the fetal ovary."
The article discusses the impact of pre-exposure to arthropod saliva on the transmission and control of vector-borne diseases. When a mammal is bitten by a blood-feeding arthropod, it is injected with vasodilatory and immunomodulatory compounds in the arthropod’s saliva that facilitate feeding. The mammalian host mounts a variety of immune responses, and local immune responses to an arthropod bite include inflammation, production of anti-salivary protein antibody, and recruitment of immune cells to the skin. Prior exposure to mosquito saliva has been shown to reduce Plasmodium burden in the liver- and blood-stage, while no pre-sensitisation effect was found for the infectivity of sporozoites. In West Nile virus, empirical evidence for the role of pre-exposure to mosquito saliva is mixed. The immunological mechanisms behind any protective effects remain unclear.The article then discusses the potential impact of pre-exposure to arthropod saliva on the effectiveness of vector control strategies. Classic epidemiological models tend to ignore the effects of immune pre-sensitisation, predicting that heightened adult vector mortality can effectively control a vector-borne disease by reducing vector abundance. However, these theoretical predictions have not always held up in practice, with insecticide spraying interventions failing to reduce the number of infections in some host populations. The article argues that the interplay between vector saliva and host immunity can produce a variety of epidemiological outcomes, depending on the effect of pre-sensitisation on the duration of infection.The authors developed mathematical models to determine the potential for pre-exposure to vector saliva to affect between-host infection dynamics and modulate the consequences of interventions that target vectors. The models showed that the interplay between vector saliva and host immunity can produce a variety of epidemiological outcomes, depending on the effect of pre-sensitisation on the duration of infection.In conclusion, pre-exposure to arthropod saliva can have a significant impact on the transmission and control of vector-borne diseases. While prior exposure to mosquito saliva has been shown to reduce Plasmodium burden in the liver- and blood-stage, the immunological mechanisms behind any protective effects remain unclear. Classic epidemiological models tend to ignore the effects of immune pre-sensitisation, and further research is needed to determine the potential for pre-exposure to vector saliva to affect between-host infection dynamics and modulate the consequences of interventions that target vectors.
Leishmaniasis is a disease affecting 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases each year. In Brazil, Leishmania amazonensis is a significant agent, causing different clinical forms of the disease. A study compared the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice to understand the effect of the host immune response on Leishmania proteins. The athymic nude mice, with a T-cell deficiency, may resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, anergic to Leishmania's antigens. The results showed that specific isoforms of virulence factors, such as OPB and tryparedoxin peroxidase, were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells probably restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. Identifying potential virulence factors and ways of regulating their expression could lead to a better understanding of the disease and potential targets for treatment.
AID, an enzyme that initiates antibody gene mutation to increase diversity, is tightly regulated and predominantly found in the cytoplasm. However, it requires access to the nucleus to function. AID stability and abundance are affected by posttranslational modifications and interactions with other proteins that modulate cytoplasmic retention and nuclear import. AID is cell cycle-regulated, with nuclear degradation occurring more slowly in G1 phase than in S or G2-M phase. Mutations that affect regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID stability and abundance. By fusing AID to tags derived from cell cycle regulators CDT1 and Geminin, it was shown that nuclear AID accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in G1 phase, but compromises viability in S-G2/M phase. These findings suggest that cell cycle regulation of AID activity may be useful for engineering genes by iterative mutagenesis and selection, and that cell cycle tags may be generally applicable to studying DNA repair, recombination, RNA biogenesis, and genome engineering.
The metabolism of plant polysaccharides by microbes is crucial to environmental carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes utilizing cellulosic bioconversion. This study demonstrates a method to analyze the catabolism of plant polysaccharides by microbes, combining carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening. The bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans, which has 171 CAZyme-encoding genes, was used as the model organism to study the fermentation of various plant biomass components. The research found that C. phytofermentans ferments glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans with varying efficiencies, and that the bacterium responds to different polysaccharides by up-regulating specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. Additionally, the study identified synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms, advancing our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass.
The studies from 1974 to 2005 in Sierra Leone showed onchocerciasis endemicity in 12 of 14 health districts, and baseline studies from 2005-2008 showed lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemicity in all 14 health districts. From 2008-2010, three integrated annual mass drug administrations (MDAs) were conducted in the 12 co-endemic districts with good geographic, programmatic, and drug coverage. A midterm assessment in 2011 determined the impact of these MDAs on LF in these districts. The mf prevalence and intensity in the 12 districts were determined using the thick blood film method and compared with baseline data from 2007-2008. Overall, mf prevalence fell from 2.6% to 0.3%, a decrease of 88.5%. Prevalence was 0.0% in four districts: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema and Kono, and seven districts had reductions in mf prevalence of between 70.0% and 95.0%. Only Bombali still had an mf prevalence ≥1.0% (1.58%). Overall, arithmetic mean mf density reduced by 65.0% among mf-positive individuals, and 95.8% for the entire population. These results show that mf prevalence decreased to <1.0% in all but one of the 12 districts after three MDAs, and overall mf density reduced by 65.0% among mf-positive individuals, and 95.8% for the entire population. LF and onchocerciasis are two of the major neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted for elimination using the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended strategy of preventive chemotherapy and transmission control (PCT). The elimination strategy is through annual MDAs with albendazole and ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine. LF elimination is implemented through the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) which has expanded MDA coverage from three million people treated in 12 countries in 2000 to more than 450 million in 53 countries in 2010. In Sierra Leone, both diseases are widely distributed across the country and co-endemic in 12 of the 14 health districts. Surveys conducted in Sierra Leone after 2002 showed that vector biting rates and community microfilaria load had reverted to pre-treatment levels in many communities. Since 2003 annual MDAs have been conducted for onchocerciasis control using the CDTI strategy. The CDTI strategy, which promotes community participation as the key aspect of ivermectin distribution to improve access to ivermectin and ensure community ownership of the process, has been observed to significantly reduce parasite prevalence and intensity in many communities of Sierra Leone since control operations resumed in 2003. Reports from health facilities had always indicated high endemicity of LF in all districts. Pre-baseline prevalence of LF was very high in south-eastern Sierra Leone. Surveys in the early 1990s showed an average mf prevalence of 34.8% in three villages in the Moyamba district. After national mapping of LF in 2005 and baseline data collection on microfilaria (mf) prevalence and density in 2007-2008, CDTI was expanded to include albendazole distribution to control LF in six co-endemic districts in 2007. With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) NTD Control Program, the NOCP was transformed into the National Neglected Tropical Diseases Control Programme (NTDCP) in 2008 to upscale treatment for LF from 6 districts to all 14 endemic districts and integrate other NTDs such as schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminthiasis into the control effort.
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, are used to explore complex natural microbial communities, like those from the ocean or the human gut. A critical step in analyzing this data is identifying dependencies between community members, which is typically done through correlation analysis. However, correlation analysis can produce unreliable results with compositional data, where observed data is presented as relative fractions of genes or species rather than absolute abundances. This issue is highlighted in a study using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, which found that many correlations among taxa can be artificial, and true correlations may even appear with opposite sign. Community diversity was identified as the key factor that modulates the severity of these compositional effects. To address this issue, the study developed a new approach called SparCC, which can estimate correlation values from compositional data, and was used to infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. The study found that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data. Compositional effects are shown to be a significant challenge in the analysis of genomic survey data, and methods like SparCC provide a solution for estimating correlations in compositional data.
Lysozyme, an antimicrobial factor found in high concentrations in mucosal surface fluids, has two antibacterial activities: a muramidase activity that hydrolyzes the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls and a non-muramidase activity attributed to its function as a cationic antimicrobial peptide. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, have been implicated in its resistance to lysozyme in vitro by modifying different sites on the peptidoglycan. The muramidase activity of lysozyme is critical for its antimicrobial effect and both peptidoglycan modifications are required for full resistance by pneumococci. During colonization of the upper respiratory tract, wild-type pneumococci out-compete the double mutant in lysozyme M-sufficient mice, but not in lysozyme M-deficient mice, indicating the importance of resistance to the muramidase activity of lysozyme during mucosal colonization. The combined peptidoglycan modifications reduce overall fitness, but this is outweighed by the benefits of resistance to the peptidoglycan degrading activity of lysozyme. Organisms that reside on mucosal surfaces where lysozyme is particularly abundant must have the ability to evade its antibacterial effects. However, the contribution of cell wall modifications, which affect lysozyme resistance, to bacterial survival on mucosal surfaces has not been examined.
Dengue is a significant global health issue, with Brazil being responsible for approximately 80% of dengue cases in the Americas. A study was conducted to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool to detect DENV in tissue specimens from previously confirmed dengue fatal cases in Brazil. The study used 74 tissue samples from 23 fatal cases and evaluated three tests for NS1 antigen capture: first generation Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip. The NS1 Ag Strip was found to be the most sensitive at detecting DENV in tissue samples, achieving 78.3% sensitivity compared to 22.9% for Dengue Early ELISA and 45.9% for Platelia NS1. These findings suggest that NS1 capture assays, such as the NS1 Ag Strip, are a valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation and may be used as a clinical/pathological diagnostic tool. However, further studies are needed to establish the specificity of this approach before NS1 antigen testing can be relied upon for the diagnosis of fatal dengue cases.
The study analyzes the molecular alterations in Multiple Myeloma (MM) between African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) patients, using whole exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and clinical data from 718 MM patients from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study Interim Analysis 9. The study found significant differences in mutation frequency between AA and CA cases in several genes, including BCL7A, BRWD3, AUTS2, TP53, and IRF4. These genes are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. The study suggests that interrogating diverse tumor cohorts can help understand tumor genomics across populations and provide rationale for addressing disparities in incidence and outcomes observed among AA or otherwise African descent patients. The study also highlights the importance of considering both self-reported race and genetic ancestry in future MM studies to better understand the biological determinants of MM.
The exome of cancer cells often has a large number of passenger mutations, which don't affect the cell's reproductive rate but provide information about the cancer's evolutionary history and can become targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment. A population of cancer cells can be described by its stochastic expansion, which can be analyzed both forward and backward in time to calculate fixation probabilities, frequencies of successive passenger mutations, and the number of cancer cells present when a certain mutation arose. Passenger mutations can be used to infer the parameters of the tumorigenic process in neutral evolution. During clonal expansion, new mutations can reach fixation in the population with a probability that increases with the mutation rate and the death-birth ratio. The expected number of subclonal mutations present at a frequency larger than α is highly dependent on the ratio δ. Formula (5) can be fitted to cancer sequencing data to determine how well the branching process model of neutral evolution describes the observed mutation frequencies and to extract the most likely parameters of the process. The frequencies of the first and most abundant passenger mutations are influenced by the death-birth ratio of the cancer cells and determine the shape of the cancer's phylogenetic tree.
The expansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) in exon1 of the huntingtin protein is linked to Huntington's disease. When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36-40 repeats, XN1 can readily form amyloid aggregates. The misfolding of a XN1 monomer plays an important role in the length-dependent aggregation, and the flanking sequences surrounding the polyQ region can play a critical role in determining the structural rearrangement and aggregation mechanism of XN1. Molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric XN1 with full flanking regions, a variant missing the polyproline regions, and an isolated polyQ peptide (Qn) were performed. The results showed that polyQ peptides have a positive correlation between their probability to form a β-rich misfolded state and their expansion length. The flanking regions of XN1 affect its probability to form a β-rich state compared to the isolated polyQ. Particularly, the polyproline regions form polyproline type II helices and decrease the probability of the polyQ region to form a β-rich state. Additionally, by lengthening polyQ, the first N-terminal 17 residues are more likely to adopt a β-sheet conformation rather than an α-helix conformation. Therefore, the molecular dynamics study provides a structural insight of XN1 misfolding and elucidates the possible role of the flanking sequences in XN1 aggregation.
CRISPR/Cas systems are a crucial defense mechanism in archaea and bacteria against foreign nucleic acids, including phages and conjugative plasmids. Consisting of repeat sequences and spacer sequences derived from foreign DNA, CRISPR arrays, along with cas genes, provide acquired resistance to viruses and conjugative plasmids. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an opportunity to explore the distribution and diversity of CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities. By using a targeted assembly strategy, researchers were able to reconstruct CRISPR arrays in HMP datasets and identified 150 known CRISPRs and discovered 86 novel CRISPRs. The distributions of these CRISPRs, both known and novel, were found to be largely body-site specific, with some CRISPRs predominantly found in stool, oral, or vaginal samples. The role of CRISPR/Cas systems in microbiomes is essential for understanding the ecology and evolution of microbiomes. The ability of CRISPRs to prevent plasmid spread is also medically relevant, as it may hinder the exchange of antibiotic resistance genes and the acquisition of resistance by pathogens. The study of CRISPRs in human microbial communities will continue to provide valuable insights into the tracing of rare species, virus exposure, and the evolution of microbiomes.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a well-established model organism for studying development and behavior, may exhibit circadian rhythms. Despite the presence of rhythms in C. elegans, their robustness and dependence on external cues are unclear. Here, genome-wide expression profiling was used to identify light- and temperature-entrained oscillating transcripts in C. elegans. These transcripts exhibited rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-h periods and were sustained under constant conditions, suggesting circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles strongly drove gene expression and appeared to entrain largely nonoverlapping gene sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolished both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, implying that environmental cues act cell nonautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. These findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggest that further analyses in this organism will provide new information about the evolution and function of this biological clock.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene is the homolog of human XPD, encoding a DNA helicase of the TFIIH complex involved in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Some mutant alleles of RAD3, such as rad3-101 and rad3-102, have partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. The hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3 strains is caused by persistent single-stranded DNA gaps converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold, with three-quarters of these crossovers reflecting DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs) and the remainder reflecting DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. A comparison of these data with previous analyses of spontaneous mitotic recombination events suggests that a sub-set of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori uses simple sequence repeats (SSRs) as contingency loci to adapt to its host environment through a slipped strand mispairing mechanism, generating heterogeneous populations. In H. pylori, an intergenically located T-tract, through slipped strand mispairing, operates with a rheostat-like function to fine-tune the activity of the sabA promoter, driving expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin SabA. The length of the T-tract generates multiphasic output from the sabA promoter, altering H. pylori binding to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on gastric mucosa. Fragment length analysis of post-infection isolated clones shows that the T-tract length is a highly variable feature in H. pylori, reflecting the host-pathogen interplay. The T-tract length affects the local DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, acting as a rheostat to modulate cognate promoter output. This mechanism provides an alternative mechanism for transcriptional regulation in bacteria like H. pylori, which have a limited repertoire of classical trans-acting regulatory factors.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade innate immune surveillance to establish persistent infections and amplify viral genomes upon differentiation. Members of the JAK-STAT family, including STAT-1 and STAT-5, regulate the innate immune response. HPV E7 activates STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels, and inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation by the drug pimozide abolishes viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes. The STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity, mediated through the ATM DNA damage response, and downstream target PPARγ contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway. These findings identify an important new regulatory mechanism by which the innate immune regulator STAT-5 promotes HPV viral replication. HPVs are the causative agents of cervical and other anogenital cancers, with high-risk genital HPVs such as HPV16, 18, 31, and 35 infecting the squamous epithelia of the genital tract. The HPV life cycle is closely associated with epithelial differentiation, and to establish persistent infection, HPVs must escape host innate and adaptive immune responses. High-risk HPV genomes encode early and late genes, with E6 and E7 playing important roles in regulation of the productive life cycle and in the development of anogenital cancers. HPV E6 and E7 have been implicated as important regulators of immune evasion. The ATM DNA damage pathway is necessary for HPV genome amplification in differentiating cells but has no effect on the stable maintenance of episomes in undifferentiated cells. Activation of the ATM DNA damage pathway has been shown to be necessary for HPV genome amplification in differentiating cells, but how they regulate HPV genome amplification and what signals are responsible for their activation remains unclear. HPVs must evade surveillance by both innate and adaptive immune responses, and the JAK/STAT pathway is one of the primary pathways regulating the innate immune response. The JAK/STAT pathway is activated by external growth signals mediated through cytokines, growth factors, and interferons, leading to translocation of STAT proteins to the nucleus and increased expression of downstream genes. Previous studies have shown that HPV gene products suppress transcription of STAT-1, but not STAT-2 or STAT-3, and that this repression is necessary for stable maintenance of viral episomes and differentiation-dependent genome amplification. We investigated if HPV proteins similarly suppress other members of the JAK-STAT pathway and found that HPV gene products activate STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. This activation was observed in the absence of any added cytokines or growth factors, suggesting that constitutive activation of STAT-5 by HPV proteins could play a role in the HPV life cycle. The levels of phospho-STAT-5 are significantly increased in HPV positive cells, and inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation by the drug pimozide suppresses HPV differentiation-dependent genome amplification and late gene expression. These findings indicate that STAT-5 plays an important role for both HPV genome amplification and for late gene expression.
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, can establish a chronic carriage state in the biliary tract of infected individuals, resulting in persistent reservoirs of infection within a community. The interaction between the host and pathogen in this carriage state is not well understood, and there is no reliable diagnostic assay to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriage. A study used in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) to identify potential biomarkers unique to carriers and identified 13 immunoreactive antigens, including YncE, an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif. Further evaluation of YncE and other antigens could lead to improved diagnostic assays to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers, which is critical for the long-term control of enteric fever. S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, human-restricted pathogens, cause enteric fever, affecting millions and leading to 200,000 deaths annually. Chronic carriers, who may act as reservoirs and introduce infection to susceptible individuals and new communities, are estimated to complicate 1-3% of acute infections. Currently, there is no reliable diagnostic assay to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A carriage. The development and persistence of the carrier state may facilitate the development of improved diagnostic assays and therapeutic approaches for S. Typhi carriage.
A new epigenetic phenomenon of trans-reactivation has been discovered, where non-functional alleles of the white gene, unable to produce a coding transcript, can reactivate in trans the expression of a wild type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. This phenomenon is heritable, relies on the presence of homologous RNAs, and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. The researchers propose a new level of gene expression control mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes. This discovery builds on the understanding of eukaryotic genomes' complexity, where at least 90% of the analyzed eukaryote genome is transcribed in different cell types, generating an enormous number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These RNAs are essential to finely control gene expression and genomic plasticity and are part of epigenetic regulatory networks with striking evolutionary conservation. Dynamic changes in chromatin function are frequently transacted by nuclear RNA signaling pathways, involving RNAs that 'rewrite' the transcriptional state of an allele, in processes that apparently escape classic Mendel's laws of genetic inheritance. These unusual epigenetic phenomena involve the activity of ncRNAs that 'rewrite' the transcriptional state of an allele, in processes that apparently escape classic Mendel's laws of genetic inheritance.
Hematophagous mosquitos and ticks avoid host hemostatic system through the expression of enzyme inhibitors that target proteolytic reactions of the coagulation and complement cascades. Boophilin, a 2-Kunitz multi-functional inhibitor found in ticks' midgut, inhibits thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. It has been expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity, and it behaves as a classical non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to small chromogenic substrates. Boophilin inhibits platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in vitro, and it also prevents FIX activation and inhibits kallikrein activity and the reciprocal activation. Additionally, Boophilin abrogates cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of TFPI. In vivo, Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion and promotes bleeding. Through inhibition of several enzymes involved in proteolytic cascades and cell activation, Boophilin plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment at low hemostatic and inflammatory tonus, which allows ticks to successfully digest a blood meal which is critical for metabolism and egg development. Boophilin is the first tick midgut FXIa anticoagulant also found to inhibit thrombosis. Protease inhibitors have been identified in the midgut of blood-sucking animals, including Ornithodorus moubatta, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Triatoma brasiliensis, Dipetalogaster maxima, and Rhodnius prolixus, as well as in Triatoma infestans and Rhipicephalus hemaphysaloides. These inhibitors display unique specificity and high-affinity binding for coagulation factors or components of the complement cascade and affect immune cells, endothelial cells, and platelet functions.
The mucosa of the intestinal tract is a finely tuned system where tissue structure strongly influences and is influenced by its function as both an absorptive surface and a defensive barrier. Inflammation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of many gastrointestinal diseases and is controlled by morphogenic pathways. The Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT) is a computational model developed to dynamically represent existing knowledge of the behavior of enteric epithelial tissue as influenced by inflammation. SEGMEnT provides insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion and chronic low level inflammation as a driver for colonic metaplasia. SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease.The structure-function relationship of the gut mucosa is crucial in the diagnosis of intestinal disease and is maintained by morphogenesis pathways subject to control modules that balance complex interplays of functional objectives. Inflammatory pathways are among the most clinically significant, playing an important role in a host of intestinal diseases. SEGMEnT is an agent-based computational model that simulates the cellular and molecular interactions that maintain and modify the enteric mucosal architecture, providing a platform for instantiating conceptual models representing baseline, healthy systems, and exploring different disease trajectories. SEGMEnT models the spatial dynamics of the crypt-villus tissue architecture, incorporating the effect of inflammation on those morphogenic processes.SEGMEnT has been used to investigate potentially pathogenic conditions such as local tissue injury resulting in a wound, the response to enteric ischemia-reperfusion, and chronic conditions that result in a persistent alteration of the homeostatic set-point of the crypt-villus architecture. SEGMEnT is a dynamic knowledge representation of a minimally sufficient set of components, mechanisms, and interactions for the maintenance of enteric mucosal architecture and the effect of inflammation, with the eventual goal of serving as a community resource. Integral to the use of computational models is their ability to replicate baseline, healthy behavior, and SEGMEnT is able to produce the appropriate cell distributions and spatial morphogen gradients leading to homeostasis.
The traditional vector control approaches, such as source reduction and insecticide spraying, have limited effect on reducing Aedes aegypti population, the primary vector for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses. A promising tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission is the endosymbiont Wolbachia, which has been deployed worldwide to reduce the spread of these diseases. The wMelBr strain of Wolbachia has a high maternal transmission rate and cytoplasmic incompatibility, making it a suitable candidate for population replacement. However, the invasion of Wolbachia into natural populations is influenced by various factors, including insecticide resistance. In a study conducted in Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro, the wMelBr strain was released for 20 consecutive weeks, but the frequency of Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti mosquitoes plateaued around 40% and dropped as releases stopped. Investigation revealed that the overuse of insecticides by householders and the release of pyrethroid-resistant genotypes in the lab colony jeopardized the Wolbachia invasion. To overcome this, a new strain (wMelRio) was produced by backcrossing wMelBr females with males from the field to introduce mostly pyrethroid resistance alleles. This new strain increased mosquito survival but produced relevant negative effects on Ae. aegypti fecundity traits, reducing egg clutch size and egg hatch. Despite the cost on fitness, wMelRio successfully established where wMelBr failed, highlighting the importance of matching the local population genetics, especially insecticide resistance background, to achieve invasion. Local householders' support was consistently high, reaching 90% backing on the second release (wMelRio strain). The drought summer and harsh temperature recorded did not affect the expression of maternal transmission of wMel on a Brazilian background. Therefore, Wolbachia deployment should match the insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to achieve invasion. Considering pyrethroid-resistance is a widely distributed phenotype in natural Ae. aegypti populations, future Wolbachia deployments must pay special attention to maintaining insecticide resistance in lab colonies for releases.
In a study on poxviruses, researchers analyzed the role of the B1 protein kinase in inactivating the cellular antiviral factor BAF and orchestrating other pathways. They used experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus to identify novel pathways involving B1. After several passages, they observed a robust increase in viral titer of the adapted virus. They found that mutations correlating with a loss of function of the vaccinia B12 pseudokinase provided a striking fitness enhancement to this virus. They also discovered that B12 possesses a potent inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of the B1 kinase. Further investigation revealed that B12 primarily localizes to the nucleus and may function in part by enhancing antiviral activity of BAF. The study presents novel evidence of a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair that can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship in a virus, serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and to orchestrate nuclear events during infection. This research contributes to the understanding of how protein kinases are regulated and what evolutionary mechanisms may have driven their conservation in all kingdoms of life as well as viruses.
The article discusses the behavior of amphiphilic peptides, which have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, and their propensity to form alpha-helices in hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces (HHI). The authors use molecular dynamics simulations to study the folding and aggregation behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKLLKLLKKLLKL (LK) and EAALAEALAEALAE (EALA), and how they respond to different environmental conditions. The study finds that both peptides display a high degree of conformational flexibility in solution, and their behavior is influenced by factors such as pH, salts, and the presence of interfaces. The authors also highlight the importance of studying the behavior of these peptides at low concentrations, as they may be the toxic species responsible for neurodegenerative diseases.In the context of amyloid-fibril forming peptides, the amphiphilic character of these proteins plays a crucial role in their aggregation and membrane activity. These peptides can interact with biomembrane surfaces, and in some cases, can penetrate and rupture membranes. This aspect links them to cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which are used for the targeted delivery of therapeutics. The folding and aggregation equilibria of these systems are complex and sensitive to external factors. In particular, folding patterns are diverse, and transitions between states are coupled to changes in peptide/protein concentration, the presence of initial aggregates, and the presence of membranes, interfaces, or surfaces.The authors use classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the environment-dependent folding equilibrium of the two model peptide systems. They find that both systems display a highly dynamic conformational behavior, with a sizeable amount of intrinsic disorder in solution and an ability to form alpha-helices under certain conditions. These synthetic peptides share the key features of their conformational behavior with natural systems such as alpha-synuclein. The study concludes that the chosen model peptides are good systems to analyze the contribution of different interactions and driving forces to the coupled equilibria of folding, aggregation, and partitioning at hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces, and to characterize typical microscopic intermediates and pathways. The study highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of these amphiphilic peptides in HHI, as they play a crucial role in biomedically important processes, such as amyloid-fibril formation, which is responsible for many human disorders, including severe neurodegenerative diseases.
Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and 6B (HHV-6B) are ubiquitous betaherpesviruses that infect humans in the first years of life and establish latency in various cell types. Both viruses can integrate their genomes into telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. The molecular mechanism of viral integration is not well understood, but the viruses harbor arrays of telomeric repeats (TMR) that are identical to human telomere sequences at the ends of their genomes. A study was conducted to determine if the TMR are involved in virus integration. The study found that deletion of both pTMR and impTMR in the HHV-6A genome did not affect the replication of the virus, but integration was severely impaired in the absence of the TMR and the virus genome was lost rapidly. The pTMR play the major role in HHV-6A integration, while the impTMR only make a minor contribution. The data shows that the HHV-6A TMR are dispensable for virus replication, but are crucial for integration and maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. HHV-6A and HHV-6B primarily infect during early childhood, with HHV-6B being the most common causative agent of the febrile illness roseola infantum and HHV-6A being associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. Both viruses establish latency and can integrate into the telomere region of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (iciHHV-6) is present in about 1% of the human population, and can reactivate from latently infected cells, causing various diseases. The underlying molecular mechanism of HHV-6 integration remains unknown.
Poxviruses have a unique method of producing infectious particles, unlike most enveloped viruses. Instead of budding through cellular compartments to acquire their lipid membrane, poxviruses generate immature particles from crescent-shaped precursors. A study of the vaccinia virus, a member of the Poxviridae family, has revealed the 2.6 Å crystal structure of D13, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. D13 forms trimers with a double-barrel organization, consisting of two jellyrolls and a head domain. The head domain is unrelated to any previously known folds and is inserted in the J2DE loop. The trimeric assembly of D13 is stabilized by interactions between J1 and J2, and an N-terminal arm that forms an amphipathic helix. Structural comparison reveals close similarity between D13 and capsid proteins of several large DNA viruses, including the major capsid protein VP54 of PBCV-1, a virus of the Phycodnaviridae family that infects unicellular green algae. This finding supports the notion that the two jellyrolls result from a duplication event that predates the divergence of the clades currently observed for all NCLDV members. Overall, the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. D13 is the target of rifampicin, which reversibly blocks morphogenesis before the immature virion stage and results in the relocation of D13 into cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Despite the eradication of smallpox by vaccination, poxviruses remain a concern for human health.
The study observes the role of model organisms in understanding the auxin biosynthesis in plants and its applicability to distant relatives. The researchers focus on Arabidopsis and Brachypodium, two plant species with different root development mechanisms. In Arabidopsis, auxin biosynthesis via IPA is essential for root development, while in Brachypodium, ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner to confer auxin levels that are sub-optimal for root cell elongation. The study reveals a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots, suggesting alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk as compared to Arabidopsis. This research highlights the importance of understanding the molecular genetic control of root growth and branching in crops to increase root system plasticity with respect to biotic and abiotic stresses.
The rate at which genes diverge in expression in species of the budding yeast is correlated with the organization of their promoter nucleosomes. Genes lacking a nucleosome-free region (OPN) vary widely between the species, while the expression of those containing NFR (DPN) remains largely conserved. To examine if early evolutionary dynamics contributes to this difference in divergence, researchers artificially selected for high expression of GFP–fused proteins. Surprisingly, selection was equally successful for OPN and DPN genes, but they adapted by distinct mechanisms. DPN-selected strains duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN-selected strains favored trans mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN genes reverted rapidly to wild-type expression levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species. These results suggest that promoter organization constrains the early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution. This demonstrates the link between the plasticity of biological traits on multiple time scales and the role of gene expression in generating phenotypic diversity, which is linked to the organization of promoter nucleosomes in yeast. The two classes of genes, OPN and DPN, differ in the way they respond to identical selection forces. Artificial selection for high expression of GFP-fused proteins resulted in duplication of large genomic regions for DPN genes and trans mutations not involving duplications for OPN genes. The findings suggest that promoter organization impacts on the early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution.
The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), a malignancy of CD4+ T cells. The HTLV-1 transactivator/oncoprotein, Tax, is thought to play a key role in ATL development. Tax is a potent activator of HTLV-1 transcription and NF-κB, and can activate the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), leading to premature poly-ubiquitination and degradation of mitotic regulators including cyclin B and Skp2. This results in p21-/27-mediated cellular senescence, which constitutes a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation. This senescence can be attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce IKK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα. The HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, can mitigate Tax-induced senescence by inhibiting NF-κB, allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate and persist. In HTLV-1-transformed T cells, the loss of p27 expression and cytoplasmic localization of p21 has been observed, indicating inactivation of the senescence checkpoint and facilitating constitutive NF-κB activation and leukemia development.
The frontal lobes are responsible for decision-making and executive control, but current models of frontal executive function do not fully explain human decision-making in naturalistic situations. A new computational model proposes that the human frontal function monitors up to three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers online their ability to predict action outcomes. When one strategy appears more reliable than unreliable, it is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new behavioral strategy is formed and probed. This model supports a view of human frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior. The ability to adapt to uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments is a hallmark of human intelligence, and this model helps to clarify how the frontal executive function controls an expanding repertoire of behavioral strategies and manages an expanding collection of behavioral strategies for driving action.
The field of medical systems biology aims to improve understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive disease progression and translate this knowledge into therapies. A new modeling approach, ADAPT, analyzes the long-term effects of a pharmacological intervention by introducing a concept of time-dependent evolution of model parameters to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations. This approach has been employed to identify metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), a potential drug target to treat or prevent atherosclerosis. The ADAPT modeling and computational analysis of LXR activation provided insights into the cascade of adaptations, specifically the counter-intuitive reduction in hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol upon prolonged treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally. The ADAPT approach can also be used to design new target interventions to prevent unwanted side effects. The approach is useful for studying biological systems from which the network topology is relatively well known, making it applicable to the study of metabolic pathways in relation to progressive diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
The spinocerebellar and spino-reticulocerebellar systems are critical for coordinating multi-segmented limbs and bodies by providing useful recombinations of sensory and motor signals to the cerebellum. These inputs are necessary for the cerebellum to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. The granule cells (GrCs) in the cerebellar cortex, which receive input from mossy fibers (MFs), have a distinct feature of a marked difference between the resting membrane potential and the threshold potential for spike firing. The molecular layer interneurons, innervated by the parallel fibers and inhibiting the Purkinje cells (PCs), allow the weights between PFs and PCs to become negative. The PCs, which constitute the only output from the cerebellar cortex, are able to modulate their spontaneous firing frequency, creating a continuous output signal. The GrCs are designed to be tonically inhibited, mostly due to alpha-6-containing GABA (A) receptors, and even when the alpha-6 subunit is knocked-out, GrCs seem to compensate for this loss by increasing the expression of potassium conductances. The traditional fast inhibitory response is gradually lost as the tonic component of the GrC inhibition develops. GrC responding with burst responses to skin stimulation show little sign of Golgi cell inhibition, but Golgi cells can still contribute to cerebellar processing by regulating the difference between the resting membrane potential and spike firing threshold of the GrCs by modulating the level of tonic inhibition. At least for the cerebellar regions involved in limb control, MFs carrying functionally equivalent inputs preferably target the same set of GrCs. The GrC layer contains a highly redundant representation of MF inputs, which is needed to average out the noise and recode the incoming MF signals. The role of the Golgi cell to GrC tonic inhibition, potentially supplemented by other sources of GABA input, is to allow the GrC responses within a redundant population to become sufficiently varied. A population of redundant GrCs, which sample functionally equivalent MF input and differ with respect to the separation between the resting and the spike firing threshold, can be used to combine the inputs from these GrCs into a piecewise-linear (PL) approximation of an arbitrary smooth function, with the number of GrCs directly related to the approximation error.
The application of genomics and Next Generation sequencing has led to the identification of a new class of cellular functional molecules, small RNAs, with microRNAs (miRNAs) being demonstrated to have a determinative influence on various cellular processes. Host/vector/pathogen encoded miRNAs have been found to impact eventual pathogenesis, with vector encoded miRNAs being investigated for their role in disease transmission and pathogen development. A study was conducted to evaluate the role of host miRNAs upon CHIKV infection in Aedes albopictus. The study identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV infected Ae. albopictus Singh's cell line respectively, as well as nine novel miRNAs. Comparison of the two libraries revealed differential expression of 77 common miRNAs between them. CHIKV infection specifically altered the miRNA profile of a specific set of eight miRNAs. This investigation provides an insight about cellular modification by miRNAs during CHIKV infection and the results provide leads for identifying potential candidates for vector based antiviral strategies.Vector borne diseases like malaria, dengue, chikungunya are a major burden to the economy of countries in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. Currently, no vaccines are available for any of the above mentioned infections and vector control with intense public awareness is the only effective measure for disease control. Understanding vector-pathogen dynamics is important for effective control strategies, with RNA interference being the most important phenomena used by insects as the first line of defense against microbial invaders. Infection of mosquitoes by virus results in generation of different kind of small RNA populations of viral origin, as well as modulation of host miRNAs.The study focused on identifying mosquito host miRNAs that may be impacted during chikungunya infection. Deep sequencing of small RNA population in Aedes albopictus Singh's cell line upon chikungunya virus infection was performed, and several Aedes known and novel miRNAs were identified and profiled. In a separate study, microRNAs in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were identified and profiled upon Plasmodium infection. During the course of analysis, it was recognized that there were miRNAs common between Aedes and Anopheles; however, there was discrete regulation of some of the common miRNAs upon infection by CHIKV and Plasmodium.In conclusion, the study described Ae. Albopictus miRNAs and their regulation upon CHIKV infection, as well as the repertoire of common and distinct host miRNAs regulated during Plasmodium and CHIKV infections in their respective hosts. Understanding the role of these miRNAs may be playing during pathogen infection in mosquitoes will aid in the development of effective control strategies for vector-borne diseases.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a significant parasitic infection in humans and livestock, causing considerable medical and economic problems in many developing countries, including Iran. However, the full socioeconomic impact of CE is not well understood in most endemic countries. A study was conducted to determine the monetary burden of CE in Iran using epidemiological and economic data. The study found that the mean number of surgical CE cases per year for 2000-2009 was 1,295, with an estimated 635,232 (95% CI 149,466-1,120,998) asymptomatic individuals living in the country. The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at US$232.3 million (95% CI US$103.1-397.8 million), including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at US$93.39 million (95% CI US$6.1-222.7 million), and the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at US$132 million (95% CI US$61.8-246.5 million). The cost per surgical human case was estimated at US$1,539. CE has a considerable economic impact on Iran, with the cost of the disease approximated at 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. Establishment of a CE surveillance system and implementation of a control program are necessary to reduce the economic burden of CE on the country. Cost-benefit analysis of different control programs is recommended, incorporating present knowledge of the economic losses due to CE in Iran.
Mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) is a DNA virus that infects mouse cells, causes lytic infection, and transforms rat cells in culture. It has a circular double-stranded DNA genome and a life cycle divided into early and late phases. During the early phase, both early-strand and late-strand transcripts are expressed, but early-strand transcripts are preferentially accumulated and spliced into mRNAs for Large, middle, and small tumor antigens. These early gene products induce host cell S phase entry and virus utilizes host factors for viral DNA replication. At late times in infection, late-strand RNAs accumulate rapidly and are alternatively spliced to generate mRNAs for the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. MPyV Large T antigen plays multiple roles during infection, including altering host protein pathways to promote virus production, blocking the interferon antiviral response, recruiting host DNA replication factors to the viral origin, acting as a helicase for viral DNA replication, and modulating late gene transcription. MPyV middle T antigen is a highly oncogenic protein necessary for viral transformation of cells in culture and functions as a scaffold to activate signal transduction pathways. MPyV small t antigen functions primarily by binding protein phosphatase 2A.Deep sequencing was used to follow MPyV infection of mouse NIH3T6 cells at various times after infection and analyze both the viral and cellular transcriptomes. The study illustrated the transcriptional profile of the early-to-late switch with both early-strand and late-strand RNAs being transcribed at all time points. RNA editing of viral transcripts was demonstrated at late times in infection. By late times in infection, 359 host genes were seen to be significantly upregulated and 857 were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis indicated that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated while transcripts involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc finger binding, SH3 domain, and GTPase activation were downregulated. Additionally, the levels of a number of long noncoding RNAs were altered, including the long noncoding RNA MALAT1, which is involved in splicing speckles and used as a marker in many late-stage cancers, was noticeably downregulated. These results provide new insights into the MPyV life cycle and its effects on host cell growth and metabolism.
"The number of participants in marathons has significantly increased over the past four decades, with a considerable percentage of them experiencing severe carbohydrate depletion, known as ""hitting the wall,"" and thousands dropping out before finishing. Traditional analyses have suggested that human glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making ""hitting the wall"" inevitable, or have implied that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon without experiencing this issue. However, a new computational study demonstrates that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle, depending on muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed. By estimating the distance at which runners will exhaust their glycogen stores as a function of running intensity, this analysis provides a basis for guidelines to ensure the safety and optimize the performance of endurance runners.In addition to these static considerations, there are also dynamic factors that influence energy management in marathon running, which some athletes and advisors might overlook. Endurance runners primarily focus on two questions: the amount of carbohydrate required for a given distance and how to avoid depleting carbohydrate reserves before completing the race. By synthesizing human physiologic data collected over several decades, the present work derives a modeling framework for providing personalized answers to these questions, taking into account aerobic capacity, relative exertion, and glycogen reservoir size under typical and maximally loaded conditions.The study further reveals that functional dependencies of the distance required to run glycogen stores to depletion, the fastest pace at which a given distance can be run without exhausting glycogen stores, and a quantitative approach to establishing an effective midrace fueling strategy. By accounting for individual physiologic variation and population distribution of aerobic capacities, the model provides a principled basis for marathon qualifying standards such as those used in the Boston Marathon. Considering both the static and dynamic factors, the study offers a comprehensive approach to understanding energy management in marathon running and ensuring optimal performance."
Toxoplasma gondii is a globally widespread intracellular parasite that can infect a variety of warm-blooded animals, and is the second leading cause of foodborne illness in terms of cost and quality-adjusted life years lost in the US. While most infections result in asymptomatic lifelong infection in immunocompetent individuals, immunocompromised individuals and congenital infections can lead to severe disease or even death. The severity of disease is influenced by both host genetic background and the genotype of the infecting strain. In Europe and North America, the majority of strains belong to one of three clonal lineages (Type I, II, or III), but in South America, a greater variety of strains are found. These strains differ in phenotypes such as virulence, persistence, and oral infectivity, and it is hypothesized that the genotype of the parasite strain plays a major role in the outcome of toxoplasmosis in patients. A study was conducted to determine if non-canonical Toxoplasma strains have unique interactions with the host cell by infecting murine macrophages with 29 different Toxoplasma strains and using RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. The study found large differences between strains in the expression level of known parasite effectors, large chromosomal structural variation in some strains, and novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains. These findings suggest that the genotype of the parasite strain plays a significant role in the outcome of toxoplasmosis and provide insight into the host response to a large variety of Toxoplasma strains.
Recombination in enteroviruses is an important evolutionary mechanism that allows for the acquisition of extensive novel sequences and has been key to the emergence of neuropathogenic poliovirus variants. However, the recombination process is still not well understood. A study used a reverse genetic approach to investigate heterologous recombination and found that chimeric intertypic polioviruses with duplicated sequences at the recombination junction could be isolated, and these imprecise junctions yielded progeny with increased fitness after serial passage. Mutations or inhibitors that altered polymerase fidelity or the coalescence of replication complexes markedly altered the yield of recombinants. The study proposed that extant recombinants result from a biphasic process in which an initial recombination event is followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness. This process has implications for the wider understanding of 'evolution by duplication' in positive-strand RNA viruses. Genetic variation in RNA viruses has important consequences for viral pathogenesis, host tropism, and evolution, and can result from misincorporation of nucleotides, recombination/reassortment, or the absence of proofreading by viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases. The human enteroviruses (HEV) are particularly well studied as they contain important pathogens responsible for various diseases. The HEV genome can be considered as modular, with recombination between the functional entities that drive translation and replication. Recombination within the P1 region is rarely observed, while different serotypes exhibit distinct temporal and geographic kinetics in the appearance of predominant recombinant forms. The majority of characterized HEV recombinants are intraspecies, but interspecies recombination may have occurred in ancestral enteroviruses. Despite the importance of recombination as an evolutionary process in enteroviruses, the molecular mechanism involved has received little attention. The favored replicative mechanism involves template-switching of the viral RdRp during negative strand RNA synthesis, but an alternative process involving the replication-independent joining of RNA molecules has also been described. Studies of the viable recombinant progeny from cells co-infected with enteroviruses are confounded by the relatively low frequency of recombinants and the high levels of parental viruses generally produced. To overcome these limitations, an in vitro reverse genetic system was developed to enable the recovery of recombinants alone from dually transfected cells in culture. This system provides important insights into the molecular mechanism of recombination in positive strand RNA viruses and suggests a means by which 'evolution by duplication' may occur.
In the treatment of metabolic diseases, beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a promising target through norepinephrine (NE) mediated signaling pathways. While NE clearance mechanisms have been reported via SLC6A2 on sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in ATs, the low catecholamine clearance capacity of SLC6A2 may limit its cleaning efficiency. A study has found that mouse organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3; Slc22a3) is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes. Adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes Maoa, Maob, and Comt, providing the molecular basis on NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. After NE administration, ablation of Oct3 induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared with littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal WAT (ingWAT) in adipose-specific Oct3-deficient mice shows much stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than in littermate controls, and this response involves enhanced β-AR/PKA/CREB pathway activation. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to significantly higher levels to compensate for the loss of ATP production in Oct3 KO adipocytes, indicating the fundamental role of glucose metabolism during beiging. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolishes the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient ingWAT, indicating the NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes in Oct3 KO adipocytes. Additionally, reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 are also identified to be associated with increased basal metabolic rate. Overall, this study demonstrates that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.
"HP1 proteins, which are crucial for heterochromatin-mediated silencing and chromosome structure in various eukaryotes, contain two primary domains: the chromo-domain (CD) and the chromoshadow-domain (CSD). The CD binds histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9, while the CSD is responsible for dimerization and interaction with many molecular partners. HP1 proteins have been found on both active and inactive genes, suggesting they are not simply ""chromatin condensers"" but rather regulators of enzymatic activities involved in transcription initiation or elongation. A study found that HP1 proteins can bind histone H3 independently of the well-characterized association of the CD with methylated K9. Specifically, the CSD interacts with a region of histone H3 located at the border of the globular domain. This region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex, and in vitro efficient SWI/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. The antagonism between SWI/SNF and HP1 proteins is also observed in vivo on a series of interferon-regulated genes. SWI/SNF activity favors loading of HP1 proteins to chromatin both in vivo and in vitro."
The significance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has increased considerably in the last decade, particularly with the discovery of endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs). RNA structure plays a crucial role in its functionality, and the self-containment property of RNA refers to its tendency to maintain the same optimal secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. The study found that miRNAs exhibit high self-containment, indicating structural invariance during biogenesis, and are notably self-contained even when embedded in a larger sequence. This robustness during biogenesis is a hallmark of the broader phenomenon of modular composability, where biopolymers are generated through the combinatorial composition of structural motifs. The study concludes that high self-containment is an intrinsic property of certain RNA sequences, indicating structural robustness and potential for a modular building block in larger structures.
In the study of plant disease resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens, researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that limit pathogen spread and are necessary for resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Mutants defective in these TFs displayed increased disease susceptibility and a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes. These genes encode peptides with a secretion signal, named PROVIR (for provirulence) factors, which are important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs. The TFs and PROVIRs identified in this work represent novel genetic determinants for plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens.Plants are constantly exposed to microbial pathogens, but only a few are capable of colonizing a specific host, suggesting the existence of efficient recognition mechanisms to activate plant defenses. Two types of microbial pathogens can be distinguished based on their lifestyles: necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens. Both types of pathogens elicit distinct host immune responses, and the timing and efficiency in activating various basal defense mechanisms is thought to underlie differences in host susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens.The study of PAMP-triggered necrotrophic immunity is largely derived from Botrytis cinerea, one of the most important fungal plant pathogens. The fungal cell wall component chitin and its constituent oligosaccharides are fungal PAMPs that activate defense responses. Polygalacturonase (PG) is another fungal component essential for virulence and is detected by the plant as a PAMP, activating host defense responses. OGs of a certain length can function as DAMPs that activate plant immunity.Resistance and susceptibility to necrotrophs is a genetically complex process involving the coordinated action of a wide range of hormones and secondary metabolites. Coordinated and timely regulation of genes in immune response pathways is central to effective plant defense. Transcription factors that affect immune responses towards necrotrophic fungal pathogens have been described, and many are involved in camalexin biosynthesis, JA-related genes, and cell wall composition.In summary, the study of plant disease resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens has identified four TFs in Arabidopsis that limit pathogen spread and are necessary for resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The TFs and PROVIRs identified in this work represent novel genetic determinants for plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. The timing and efficiency in activating various basal defense mechanisms is thought to underlie differences in host susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens.
In the endometrium, a receptive state is required for successful embryo implantation, and poor uterine receptivity can result in recurrent pregnancy loss or failures in in vitro fertilization cycles. A study has discovered that the transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) is a vital regulator of endometrial receptivity in vivo. Foxo1 ablation in mice using the progesterone receptor Cre (PgrCre) mouse model resulted in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing the embryo from penetrating the luminal epithelium. Additionally, during the window of receptivity (WOR), FOXO1 regulates gene expression for transcripts involved in cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-catenin signaling pathway, and PGR signaling. FOXO1 and PGR signaling are interrelated, and their reciprocal expression is critical for embryo implantation. FOXO1 is localized in the nucleus of the luminal and glandular epithelium of the endometrium during the WOR in humans and mice and in the cytoplasm of the murine decidua as pregnancy processes. FOXO1 is involved in regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolic flux, and its expression is required for decidualization in human endometrial stromal cells in tissue culture settings. The conditional ablation of Foxo1 in the mouse uterus results in infertility due to disrupted implantation of the blastocyst, and several important pathways involved in the fetal-maternal crosstalk are regulated by FOXO1, including those that allow the removal of the epithelial barrier for trophoblastic invasion.
A study was conducted to map the spatial variation of dengue cases in Bangladesh, a country where dengue is endemic and cases are under-reported. The researchers developed a negative binomial generalized linear mixed effect model that accounted for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects. The model was fitted to district-level monthly reported dengue cases over the period 2000 to 2009. The study found that temperature and its interaction with diurnal temperature range, as well as rainfall, were significantly associated with dengue incidence. The model estimated that 92% of annual dengue cases occurred between August and September. Despite this, less than half of the affected districts reported cases as observed from the surveillance data. The majority of cases were identified in the capital Dhaka, which is located in the middle of the country. The study highlights the importance of considering under-reporting and incorporating climatic and demographic factors in disease mapping. The resulting maps can help in efficiently distributing vector control interventions to areas of highest need at the appropriate time.
"When mammals, including rats and mice, are introduced into a novel environment, they establish preferred places within it. Rats have a distinct home base, characterized by the highest frequency of visits, longest cumulative dwell time, and low outbound trajectory speed with high inbound speed. Mice, on the other hand, have a lower occurrence of home base establishment during forced exploration of a relatively featureless environment. However, when exposed to a large open field arena, mice, especially those injected with saline, establish preferred places called ""knots,"" where they perform ""knot-scribbling,"" tracing a tortuous path full of twists, turns, and bends. These knots are typically not associated with physical objects or nesting material, but are enhanced by stress and arousal. The establishment of knots could function as a way to obtain an overview of the entire environment, allowing re-calibration of the mouse's locale map and compass directions. Intact mice establish knots during exploratory behavior, regardless of saline injection, indicating that knots are natural ethological building blocks of mouse exploration."
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) cause a significant number of deaths worldwide, with Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus being the major human fungal pathogens. The development of new antifungal drugs is challenging due to the high evolutionary conservation between fungi and man, resulting in a limited number of druggable nodes. A study identified NGx04, an ergoline compound, with selectivity over mammalian cells and activity against C. neoformans. High-resolution chemogenomics revealed that the lipid transfer protein Sec14p is the target of NGx04, with compound-resistant mutations defining compound-target interactions in the substrate binding pocket of the protein. Sec14p is essential for the pathogenicity of fungi such as C. neoformans, making it an attractive antifungal target. NGx04 inhibits the growth of C. neoformans, and NGx04-related compounds have fungicidal activity against a fluconazole resistant C. neoformans strain. These findings suggest that NGx04 inhibits fungal Sec14p and supports its potential as a novel antifungal starting point.
Schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease that disproportionately affects those living in poverty, is often neglected despite affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The disease is caused by a digenetic trematode of the genus Schistosoma, with S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni being the primary species affecting humans. Current treatment and control of schistosomiasis depend on a single drug, praziquantel, which exclusively targets adult worms and has minor activity against young developing stages. This reliance on a single drug has led to concerns about the emergence of drug-resistant parasites.A study reports the antischistosomal properties of mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, in mice infected with adult Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum. A single dose of mefloquine (200 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally resulted in high or complete total and female worm burden reductions (72.3%-100%). Furthermore, high worm burden reductions were observed for young developing stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum harbored in the mouse. Both mefloquine erythro-enantiomers resulted in high and comparable total and female worm burden reductions when given to mice with either a sub-patent or patent S. mansoni infection.The findings suggest the potential of mefloquine as a novel antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality. Further studies are underway to elucidate the possible mechanism of action and to study the effect of mefloquine on S. haematobium and other trematodes. The study highlights the potential impact of mefloquine, which is widely and effectively used for the treatment of malaria, on schistosomiasis in areas where both malaria and schistosomiasis co-exist. The study emphasizes the importance of developing new antischistosomal drugs due to the paucity of a concerted effort to develop novel antischistosomal drugs and the high failure rates of compounds during preclinical and clinical testing.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to map the distribution of podoconiosis, a neglected tropical disease that causes swelling of the lower legs, and contribute to the global atlas of podoconiosis. The study used a multi-stage sampling design with stratification of the country by environmental risk of podoconiosis and surveyed 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households in 76 villages. The results showed that the overall prevalence of podoconiosis was 0.5% (95% CI; 0.4--0.7), with at least one case found in every region of Cameroon except Adamawa. The majority of clusters surveyed, 58%, reported no cases of podoconiosis, but there appeared to be micro-epidemiological heterogeneity in the prevalence of podoconiosis with four clusters located in the Northwest region showing relatively higher prevalence. The study demonstrated low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon, indicating a need for a health system response to the burden of podoconiosis through case surveillance and morbidity management services. This is the first national population-based survey of podoconiosis in Cameroon, and the data collected will be useful for developing an efficient and cost-effective podoconiosis control and elimination program in the country.
Stem cell aging is associated with reduced stem cell occupancy in the niche, and this phenomenon is observed in various organisms, including mammals, Drosophila, and C. elegans. A study on Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) found that Notch signaling plays a role in controlling GSC-niche adhesion in response to aging. Specifically, Notch signaling is increased with age in GSCs, leading to their removal from the niche. This is due to decreased adhesiveness of GSCs with higher levels of Notch signaling, which allows GSCs with lower levels of Notch signaling to out-compete them for niche occupancy. Notch activation is mediated by Fringe, a glycosyltransferase that modulates the binding of Notch to its ligands, and is regulated by insulin signaling in response to diet. The study found that while insulin/IGF signaling is required for GSC proliferation and maintenance, Notch signaling is involved in the diminished ability of GSCs to occupy the niche during aging. In young ovaries, Notch signaling in GSCs is low, allowing them to persist in the niche. However, as ovaries age, Notch signaling in GSCs is elevated, resulting in the loss of GSCs from the niche. Notch signaling in niche cells, which is required for niche integrity, is decreased with age, contributing to age-induced GSC loss. Therefore, both intrinsic and extrinsic Notch signaling control the niche residency of GSCs during aging.
The UL97 protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a kinase that phosphorylates cellular proteins, including the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor and lamin A/C. This kinase has been shown to have authentic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-like activity. Other human herpesviruses also encode kinases with similar sequences and positions, known as conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs). These CHPKs are found in all three herpesvirus families: alpha, beta, and gamma. To determine if the Cdk-like activities of UL97 were shared by all CHPKs, a study expressed and tested individual epitope-tagged alleles of each protein in human cells and yeast. The results showed that the ability to phosphorylate Rb and lamin A, and to disrupt the nuclear lamina, was shared by all CHPKs from the beta and gamma-herpesvirus families, but not by their alpha-herpesvirus homologs. Similarly, all but one of the beta and gamma CHPKs displayed bona fide Cdk activity in yeast, while the alpha proteins did not. These virally-encoded Cdk-like kinases (v-Cdks) are likely to serve both overlapping and non-overlapping functions during viral infections, and some are targets of approved or developmental antiviral drugs. The CHPKs play important roles in viral replication and are involved in tegument disassembly, modulation of gene expression, stimulation of viral DNA replication, and facilitating capsid nuclear egress in part through disruption of the nuclear lamina. The UL97 kinase of HCMV was found to directly phosphorylate the Rb tumor suppressor protein both in vivo and in vitro, on residues that are normally targeted by cellular Cdk proteins, and to rescue the G1-to-S cell cycle defect of yeast cells lacking Cdk function, indicating that the kinase has Cdk activity. This makes UL97 the first identified v-Cdk. Further study showed that the CHPKs encoded by the beta and gamma-herpesviruses are all capable of inducing Rb phosphorylation in vivo on residues that inactivate the cell cycle inhibitory and tumor suppressor function of this protein, and disrupt the nuclear lamina. Importantly, all the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs, with the exception of the HHV-8 (KSHV) ORF36 protein, displayed authentic Cdk function in the yeast complementation assay. The alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs were unable to phosphorylate Rb or lamin A, efficiently disrupt the nuclear lamina, or act as Cdks in S. cerevisiae. When all eight kinases were assayed for additional non-Cdk functions, it was found that despite the evolutionary conservation of these proteins, functional conservation was poor. Altogether, the study identifies a subset of the CHPKs as v-Cdks, but also indicates that the positional homology and amino acid similarity of these protein kinases does not always translate into common substrates or similar biological activities for these proteins.
The bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, is a Tier 1 Select Agent and is a Gram-negative bacillus present in the environment in many tropical countries. An international working party, Detection of Environmental Burkholderia pseudomallei Working Party (DEBWorP), was formed during the VIth World Melioidosis Congress in 2010 to review the literature on the detection of environmental B. pseudomallei, update the risk map for melioidosis, and propose international consensus guidelines for soil sampling. The working party found that global coverage of B. pseudomallei in the environment was patchy, with a lack of studies in many areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur. The sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable and not all were robust. The proposed consensus guidelines provide the basis for the development of an accurate and comprehensive global map of environmental B. pseudomallei. Melioidosis is a community-acquired infectious disease caused by the environmental Gram-negative bacillus B. pseudomallei. It is acquired through contact with B. pseudomallei in the environment, and defining the global distribution of environmental B. pseudomallei is important for the development of a risk map for melioidosis. Environmental sampling can be used to identify areas where people are at risk even before cases are recognized. However, the studies lacked standardization in almost all aspects of study design and conduct. The proposed consensus guidelines aim to reduce the probability of false-negative results and provide affordable and ‘low-tech’ methodology that is applicable in both developed and developing countries.
The mechanism of membrane fusion by class II viral fusion proteins involves large-scale domain rearrangements of the envelope glycoprotein and a transition from dimers to trimers. Peptides derived from the stem of dengue-virus E bind stem-less E trimer, modeling a conformational intermediate, and inhibit viral fusion. These peptides specifically block viral infection with potency proportional to their affinity for the conformational intermediate. The stem peptides inhibit infectivity even when free peptide is removed from a preincubated inoculum before infecting cells, suggesting that peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes. Binding depends on particle dynamics, as there is no inhibition of infectivity if preincubation and separation are at 4°C rather than 37°C. The stem peptides bind sE in its rearranged, trimeric conformation, but not the sE dimer, and inhibition of infectivity is reversible. The results suggest that non-specific membrane interactions may dominate the initial association of peptide and virion and that this sequestration may concentrate the peptide in the viral membrane for rapid association during the short lifetime of the E-protein fusion intermediate. The stem peptides gain access to sites on the viral membrane that are occluded in the equilibrium structure, and dynamics of the virion surface permit access to transiently exposed sites on E, on the membrane, or on both. The peptide-virion interactions are specific, as biotinyl-DV2419-447 binds virions efficiently at pH 8, and the yield of retained virions decreases at 4°C. Membrane binding of stem peptides decreases lipid mobility and hence decreases the likelihood of excimer formation.
Cholera is a significant global health concern, with an estimated 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually. Recent outbreaks in places like Haiti and Yemen demonstrate the need for effective strategies to control and eliminate the disease. A promising approach involves using stool specimens preserved on filter paper for molecular analysis of Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. This method is particularly useful in resource-limited settings, as it allows for the rapid, low-cost, and safe preservation of specimens for sequencing. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of these specimens can provide valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information and confirm the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest. WGS can also identify co-infections with other diarrheal pathogens, which may impact the severity of disease. In a study of cholera outbreaks in Cameroon, dried filter paper spotted with APW-enriched specimens and culture isolates was found to be a viable method for preserving genomic material for characterization of the outbreak. This method allowed for DNA extraction and PCR amplification, even after storage at room temperature for up to 2 years. WGS of these specimens confirmed the presence of V. cholerae and provided valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information. Overall, the use of dried filter paper for stool specimen preservation, along with WGS, has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of cholera outbreaks and inform public health responses.
An intense investigation has discovered a complex protein network controlling epithelial polarity, with cytoplasmic Dynein as a key regulator. A genetic screen for epithelial defects in Drosophila follicle cells found that Dynein, through the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust, localizes the transmembrane protein Crumbs, particularly during early stages of epithelial development. Dynein-dependent apical targeting of specific sdt mRNA isoforms enriches Sdt protein in the apical cytoplasm. A unique mechanism was introduced where alternative splicing of a coding exon controls mRNA localization during development. This discovery highlights the importance of mRNA localization in the regulation of apico-basal organization and adds a new class of gene products, mRNAs, to the existing paradigm for apico-basal polarity regulation.
Leishmania, a unicellular digenetic parasite known for its clonal reproduction mode, has been suggested to have a non-obligate sexual cycle in its extracellular stage within the sand fly vector. This proposition comes from genetic analysis of populations and co-infections in sand flies, indicating the possibility of intraclonal genetic exchange. A study found that transgenic L. infantum lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters were able to successfully exchange both types of markers within the sand fly midgut of the natural vector Phlebotomus perniciosus when individuals from these species were fed with a mixture of parental clones. The hybrid progeny appeared to be triploid based on DNA content analysis. The hybrid clone analyzed was stable throughout the complete parasite life cycle. Infections by the hybrid clone in BALB/c mice caused a reduction in parasite loads in both spleen and liver, and provided weight values similar to those obtained with uninfected mice. Spleen arginase activity was also significantly reduced relative to parental strains. These findings suggest that Leishmania has the ability to recognize the same genotype and mate, and that the yellow hybrid progeny is stable throughout the whole parasite life cycle but with a slower virulence, which correlates well with the lower arginase activity detected both in vitro and in vivo infections.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Ethiopia, caused by Leishmania donovani, is a major health problem, with parasites clustering in distinctive genotypes depending on the geographic region and transmitted by different vectors. A recent study analyzed 63 L. donovani strains from VL and HIV-VL co-infected patients in north and south Ethiopia, using PCR targeting ITS1, cpb, and HASPB (k26) regions. Results showed that the k26-PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin, with most strains from northwestern Ethiopia producing a 290 bp product and almost all strains (4/40) from HIV-VL co-infected patients giving a 410 bp amplicon. In contrast, most strains (20/23) from southwestern Ethiopia produced a 450 bp amplicon with smaller products (290 or 360 bp) only observed for three strains. High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis distinguished the different PCR products, and sequence analysis showed that the k26 repeat region in L. donovani is comprised of polymorphic 13 and 14 amino acid motifs. The number and order of the repeats in L. donovani vary between geographic regions, and this should be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen. VL, transmitted by L. donovani, is primarily found in Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia, accounting for 30,000-57,000 cases each year, resulting in 20-40,000 deaths annually.
The HIV-1 genome, which causes AIDS, is highly diverse due to error-prone reverse transcriptase, high viral turnover, and diversifying selection from the immune response. This diversity is partitioned into phylogenetic clusters called subtypes, and recombination between subtypes can generate inter-subtype recombinants. When these recombinants are transmitted between individuals, they are termed Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) and can contribute significantly to the pandemic. A study hypothesized that only a subset of recombination breakpoints, the points where the parental strands switch, convey any selective advantage. The null hypothesis is that most recombination breakpoints are selectively neutral. A probabilistic model was generated to test this hypothesis, taking into account the local sequence identity between the co-packaged RNA genomes and producing an expected null distribution of breakpoints across two parental sequences. The results indicate that the majority of recombination breakpoints detected in the HIV-1 pandemic provide limited selective advantage, with the exception of specific genomic regions in which recombination events have a higher probability of being important to viral evolution. Recombination breakpoints are less likely to occur within five nucleotides of a mismatch between the aligned parental strains, and the probability of a breakpoint occurring is reduced within a window of size five nucleotides anchored to the 5′ end of each mismatch. The model accurately predicts the breakpoint distribution in experimental data and can identify regions where there is a significant over- or under-representation of breakpoints.
Computational modeling is crucial in modern neuroscience research, with statistical methods used to address two interdependent problems: estimating individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects for a given computational model, and comparing and estimating individual variation in expressed models. Previous research has addressed these problems separately, but a new hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework combines them, providing advantages for parameter estimation and model comparison. The HBI framework estimates parameters with smaller errors, is robust against outliers, and unbiased in model comparison. The HBI enables researchers to make inferences on group-level parameters through a fully Bayesian approach, and its advantages are demonstrated through synthetic and empirical datasets, outperforming previous methods. Computational modeling studies typically aim to compare model evidence across competing models and estimate free parameters for each individual and their group-level distributions. The HPE procedure employs a hierarchical approach to define priors based on group statistics, while HBI adds another level of hierarchy for each subject's model, allowing for joint inference of model identities and parameters. This results in a fully Bayesian framework that quantifies uncertainty and provides a rigorous statistical test for making inferences about population-level model parameters.
The study reveals that individual rhombomeres, specifically r4, and their associated Hox codes play a crucial role in the assembly of distinct functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem. The r4 contributes to functionally linked sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN), and motor olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of r4-derived auditory components is involved in sound perception and depends on regulatory interactions between Hoxb1 and Hoxb2. Mutant mice with Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 mutations lose the transmission of low-level auditory stimuli, leading to hearing impairments. Hoxa2 regulates the Rig1 axon guidance receptor and controls contralateral projections from the anterior VCN to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. Therefore, r4 and its associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem, playing a crucial role in sound perception and localization.
The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-4
Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) is a significant cause of viral neurological infections in children across Asia, with genotype dominance shifting from genotype III (GIII) to genotype I (GI) in recent years. Culex mosquitoes play a critical role in maintaining the enzootic transmission cycle of JEV, and a study was conducted to determine if mosquitoes played a potential role in JEV genotype shift. Female Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were exposed orally to either GI or GIII JEV strains, and midgut, whole mosquitoes, secondary organs, and salivary glands were collected at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) for analysis. The study found that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates and growth kinetics. However, GI-infected mosquitoes had a slightly higher positive rate in salivary glands at 14 dpi compared to GIII-infected mosquitoes, indicating a higher transmission potential. Overall, the study suggests that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift, but further studies are needed to confirm this conclusion. JEV is a significant public health concern in Asia, and understanding the role of mosquitoes in JEV genotype shift is essential for developing effective control strategies.
Dengue infection, a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant health threat in tropical and subtropical countries, including Malaysia, which has experienced large outbreaks in recent years. This summary focuses on a retrospective review of dengue deaths in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014. A total of 322 dengue deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40.7±19.3 years, and 72.5% of them being adults. The most common warning signs were lethargy or restlessness, persistent vomiting, and laboratory markers indicating hemoconcentration. However, 22.4% did not exhibit any warning signs. Only 34% were suspected of having dengue at their initial presentation.Severe plasma leakage, multi-organ involvement, and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) were common in fatal cases, with DSS being the leading cause of death, regardless of age groups. More adults developed severe plasma leakage, and elderly patients had more heart involvement. The atypical presentation and rapid progression of severe dengue highlight the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent deaths. This study emphasizes the importance of increased awareness, monitoring, and healthcare interventions to reduce dengue-related mortality.
The authors previously discovered that global manipulation of insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway that affects reproductive potential, changes the composition and attractiveness of female pheromones in fruit flies. Here, they investigate the tissue specificity of insulin signaling effects on attractiveness by examining tissues involved in Drosophila reproduction and attractiveness phenotypes.Modulation of insulin signaling in oenocytes, which produce attractiveness cues, does not affect attractiveness, suggesting that other tissues may be involved. Elimination of functional ovaries reverses the effects of global insulin signaling on female attractiveness, and insulin signaling manipulation in ovarian tissues, specifically in late follicle cells surrounding vitellogenic oocytes, recapitulates the effects of global manipulations. Manipulations of insulin signaling targeted to the fat body produce opposite effects on attractiveness compared to global manipulations. These findings suggest that female attractiveness results from an interplay of insulin-dependent attractiveness cues from oenocytes and the fat body, integrated with reproductive effort in late-stage follicle cells. This system has implications for understanding the mechanism and reliability of Drosophila mate assessment.
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa from 2013-2015 spread heterogeneously across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with significant variation in transmission at the district level. A statistical modeling approach was used to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each district and country using weekly incident case numbers, with growth rates estimated during the early exponential phase of the outbreak. At the district level, R0 ranged from 0.36 in Dubréka, Guinea to 3.37 in Margibi, Liberia, and at the national level, R0 was estimated to be 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra Leone. Socio-demographic variables related to urbanization, such as high population density and high wealth index, were positively associated with R0, suggesting that the consequences of fast urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD. Overall, the estimation of national transmission offers little information about subnational dynamics, and the availability of district-level data provides a unique opportunity to investigate local disease transmission during the 2013-2015 epidemic.
The factors that determine a protein's rate of evolution are a subject of debate, with unclear relative roles of intrinsic present-day protein properties versus historical factors such as protein age. A study of human and mouse protein orthologs with mapped PDB structures found that structural properties and evolutionary rates are correlated within age groups, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and evolutionary rates. However, age also plays a crucial role, as younger proteins tend to evolve faster than older proteins, even though they are less designable. These findings suggest that multiple factors, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution. Previous studies have identified various determinants of protein evolutionary rate, such as protein dispensability, expression level, number of protein-protein interactions, sequence length, role in the interaction network, and structural properties. However, it is difficult to identify causal factors due to correlations between these determinants. A principal component regression analysis found that a single component, including codon adaptation index, protein abundance, and gene expression level, accounted for nearly half of the observed variability in protein rate variation, but expression-related factors are measured with less noise than other possible factors. A protein's three-dimensional structure plays a key role in determining its evolutionary rate, with the core of a protein mostly formed by buried residues that often play a crucial role in the stability of the folded structure. Exposed residues tend to evolve faster than buried ones, and the relationship between solvent exposure and evolutionary rate is linear and strong. However, a protein's structural characteristics, such as the number of intra-protein residue interactions, can also affect its evolutionary rate. Additionally, the age of a protein, which depends on its evolutionary history, is correlated with its evolutionary rate, suggesting that a protein's evolution could be shaped in part by its evolutionary origin. Overall, the factors that determine a protein's rate of evolution remain poorly characterized, and the relative roles of intrinsic and historical factors of present-day proteins versus protein age remain unclear.
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is crucial for regulating gene expression during development, embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, and cancer by trimethylating lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). This study identifies Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3) as a component of PRC2 that promotes ESC self-renewal. Pcl3 interacts with core PRC2 components and its knockdown decreases H3K27me3 levels, indicating its role in promoting PRC2 function. Pcl3 localizes at a subset of PRC2 targets, including genes and microRNAs associated with differentiation and development, and its Tudor domain is essential for this function. Pcl3 and its paralog Pcl2 exist in different PRC2 complexes but bind many of the same PRC2 targets. Thus, Pcl3 is a critical component of PRC2 for ESC self-renewal, histone methylation, and recruitment of PRC2 to a subset of its genomic sites. The study also highlights the importance of Pcl3 in maintaining ESC self-renewal and regulating PRC2 binding at diverse target genes.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans changes its chemosensory behavior depending on its feeding state, and this is achieved through the dynamic regulation of chemoreceptor gene expression. A study focused on the chemoreceptor gene srh-234, which is specifically expressed in ADL sensory neurons, found that its expression levels are highly dependent on feeding state conditions. In fed animals, srh-234 is strongly expressed in ADL neurons, but when starved, the expression is rapidly downregulated. The feeding state-dependent regulation of srh-234 occurs at the level of transcription, with a predicted MEF2 factor binding site and an E-box motif identified in the minimal promoter of srh-234. The E-box motif is necessary for srh-234 expression in ADL neurons, while the MEF2 site is required to repress, but not promote, srh-234 expression during starved conditions.The study also identified multiple bHLH genes as regulators of srh-234 expression levels. Mutations in hlh-2, hlh-3, mxl-3, and hlh-4 reduced srh-234 expression in fed conditions, while hlh-30 mutants suppressed the starvation-induced downregulation of srh-234. The bHLH transcription factors HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4 are transiently expressed in and act in ADL neurons to regulate srh-234 expression. The expression levels of srh-234 in ADL is remotely regulated by MXL-3 and HLH-30 acting in the intestine via non-cell-autonomous regulation of srh-234 expression mediated by DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin signaling in ADL. These findings suggest that MEF2 and bHLH transcriptional factors link feeding state conditions via insulin signaling to the regulation of chemoreceptor genes in chemosensory neurons. The identification of the MEF2 and E-box motifs and their roles in srh-234 expression provides insight into the cis- and trans-regulatory logic for chemoreceptor gene expression and highlights the importance of studying feeding state-dependent gene regulation in C. elegans.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a destructive skin condition caused by the environmental bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The transmission of M. ulcerans is not fully understood, but several studies suggest that biting insects, particularly mosquitoes, may be involved. In this study, the authors investigated the correlation between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of BU in humans in an endemic area of southeastern Australia. Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, Australia, from December 2004 to December 2009 and screened for M. ulcerans by real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of BU in permanent residents of these towns diagnosed during the same period was tallied to determine the average cumulative incidence of BU in each location. The authors found a strong dose-response relationship between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease (r, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92--0.99; p<0.001). This study adds to the evidence that mosquitoes are involved in the transmission of M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia, which has implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU.
The rat demyelination (dmy) mutation is a unique model for studying myelin maintenance, as it results in severe myelin breakdown in the CNS after postnatal completion of myelination. A G-to-A transition, 177 bp downstream of exon 3 of the Mrs2 gene, generates a novel splice acceptor site and functionally inactivates the mutant allele. This gene encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria and is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis. The dmy/dmy rats have major mitochondrial deficits, and MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats show that MRS2 is dominantly expressed in neurons and localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Therefore, it can be concluded that dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease and have a different mechanism for myelin maintenance than its initial production. Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin. Myelin is essential for correct neural function, and any event causing an imbalance in myelination or remyelination has a high chance of inducing dys- or demyelination of the central or peripheral nervous system. The knowledge of the myelination process has benefited from studies on human patients with defects of myelination and myelin turnover, as well as from research on animal models. However, there is still a small number of genes directly or indirectly involved in the myelination process that have been identified and functionally annotated. Therefore, any new mutation occurring spontaneously or after mutagenesis, such as the dmy mutation, is of potential interest for unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in myelin assembly.
Microarray gene expression signatures have the potential to be powerful tools for patient stratification, diagnosis of disease, prognosis of survival, assessment of risk group, and selection of treatment. However, before they can impact clinical practice, they need to be communicated to other healthcare centers with data for external evaluation and ultimately to practitioners for use in clinical routine. This requires unambiguous documentation of the signature. Currently, documentation standards do not allow for an unambiguous application to study-external patients, hindering independent evaluation and delaying their use in clinical practice. A study of eight clinical microarray studies found that discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as frequent as 30% (worst case) and 18% (median). By using the proposed documentation by value strategy, which documents quantitative preprocessing information, the median discrepancy was reduced to 1%. The study shows that the process of evaluating microarray gene expression diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice can be substantially improved and made more reliable by better documentation of the signatures.
Curli amyloid fibrils, secreted by Enterobacteriaceae, play a crucial role in host cell adhesion, biofilm formation, and promoting bacterial resistance to environmental stressors. Two studies reveal structural similarities between curli and human pathological amyloids by presenting crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, CsgA. These steric zipper fibrils are composed of tightly mated β-sheets, suggesting a link between curli and human pathological amyloids. D-enantiomeric peptides, originally developed for Alzheimer’s disease-associated amyloid-β, inhibited CsgA fibrillation and reduced biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Furthermore, CsgA fibrils cross-seeded fibrillation of amyloid-β, supporting their structural resemblance and potential cross-species amyloid interactions. These findings provide structural insights into amyloidogenic regions important for curli formation, suggest a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms, and hypothesize on the formation of self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source that could influence neurodegenerative diseases.
The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a significant public health threat in most of Asia, including the Philippines, with high case fatality rates and significant neurologic sequelae in survivors. The epidemiology of JE in the Philippines is not well-defined, with limited surveillance and laboratory confirmation. A systematic literature review and analysis of surveillance data from 2011-2014 revealed endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines. The review identified 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 reports of clinical cases, and 8 animal studies. JEV was the causative agent in 7-18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined and 16-40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age and resulted in 6-7% case fatality. Surveillance data from 2011-2014 identified 73 (15%) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested. Continued and improved surveillance with laboratory confirmation is needed to quantify the burden of JE, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and measure the impact of preventive measures, including immunization against this important public health threat.
The evolutionary origins of genetic robustness, or the invariance of phenotypes in the face of perturbations, are still a topic of debate. Some researchers believe that it arises due to requirements imposed by varying environmental conditions, while others argue that it is due to intrinsic factors such as metabolic requirements or an adaptive selection in favor of genes that allow a species to endure genetic perturbations. A recent study used a large-scale computational approach to chart the level of robustness of metabolic networks in hundreds of bacterial species across many simulated growth environments. The study found that variations among species in their level of robustness reflect ecological adaptations, with at least 20% of the non-essential reactions being due to environmental-dependent factors and associated with the species' lifestyle. Additionally, the study found that environmental-independent factors, such as intrinsic metabolic capacities, also play a role in metabolic robustness. However, environmental robustness, or the ability to buffer against external changes, cannot fully explain the dispensability of genes. The study identifies reactions that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug-targets. Overall, the study highlights the intertwined nature of genetic and environmental robustness in metabolic networks and the importance of studying the underlying mechanisms in order to understand the evolution of genetic robustness.
"The study ""Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunisation (IMoChI)"" was conducted to investigate the effects of Schistosoma mansoni infection on responses to measles catch-up immunization and of praziquantel treatment on this outcome in a randomized trial in Entebbe, Uganda. The study enrolled children aged 3-5 years, with and without S. mansoni infection. The study found that at one week post-immunization, S. mansoni-infected children had lower levels of anti-measles IgG and a lower percentage with protective antibody levels compared to uninfected children. Among S. mansoni-infected children, those treated with praziquantel had higher anti-measles IgG levels one week post-immunization compared to those not yet treated. At 24 weeks post-immunization, IgG levels did not differ between the trial groups, but tended to be lower among previously-infected children who were still S mansoni stool-positive than among those who became stool-negative. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection among pre-school children is associated with a reduced antibody response to catch-up measles immunization and that praziquantel treatment improves the response. The study highlights the potential impact of S. mansoni infection on vaccine efficacy in endemic populations."
The evolution of bacterial populations has been better understood through large-scale sequencing of population samples, revealing that DNA sequences from multiple genes and broad sample coverage are needed for an unbiased view of genetic structure and ancestry patterns. However, traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference like phylogenetic analysis face difficulties under extensive sampling scenarios, particularly when recombination is expected. To address this, statistical tools for detecting and representing recombination between populations and a model-based description of a population's molecular variability and affinity towards other populations have been introduced. These tools are available in the BAPS 5.2 software. Recombination plays a major role in shaping bacterial populations' genetic structure, with varying probabilities for certain populations to undergo recombination. Preferential recombination should lead to greater admixture between populations, detectable through DNA sequence data. Despite challenges, statistical analysis of molecular variation and reproductive isolation in natural populations is essential for understanding patterns of virulence and antibiotic resistance. Bayesian statistical approaches based on explicit admixture models have gained popularity for studying bacterial populations. The BAPS models in the software identify molecular evidence linking a group of strains together based on nucleotide frequencies, with the aim of estimating the strength of gene flow via a stochastic characterization of admixture rates between identified populations.
Cortical rhythms, particularly beta rhythms in the 20 Hz range, have been found to play crucial roles in cognitive abilities and attention. Studies using a computational model of sensory cortical areas suggest that top-down beta rhythms, generated in higher cognitive areas and delivered to earlier sensory areas, can support attentional gain modulation by activating ascending synaptic projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3 in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons are shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate the activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. These findings suggest a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention. The model also supports the hypothesis that primary sensory L5 cells, resonating to top-down beta frequency inputs, can modulate responses of superficial neurons in sensory cortices predominantly through SI interneurons. These results provide new insights into the functional roles of beta rhythms and their underlying mechanisms in attentional gain control.
The article discusses the value of stochastic transmission dynamic models for studying the emergence of new pathogens and the challenge of developing methods for parameter estimation and prediction. The authors propose a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS). MSS uses a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations and updates the belief about the true epidemic state using each new surveillance observation. The authors evaluate MSS using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen and compare its performance to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods. They find that MSS outperforms the benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. The authors conclude that MSS may improve on current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics. The sporadic emergence of new human pathogens highlights the importance of monitoring pathogen spread in human populations and the need for tools to make inference about the true state of the epidemic and the values of fundamental epidemic parameters using observations that can only imperfectly represent the true epidemic state. The authors propose MSS as a promising method for this purpose.
The study investigates the factors that influence visual perception, focusing on the role of past stimuli and perceptual decisions. An experiment was conducted to compare the ability of sensory stimuli and perceptual decisions to predict future errors in an orientation adjustment task. The results showed that previous responses, after correcting for orientation-dependent biases, were a more efficient predictor of serial dependence than the relative orientation of consecutive stimuli. This suggests that attractive biases in visual perception may result from the history of perceptual decisions. A second experiment presented stimuli at the fovea and varied the relative orientation of consecutive stimuli to ensure a fair comparison between models. The results replicated the first experiment, confirming that previous perceptual decisions are a better predictor of serial dependence than previous stimuli. The study concludes that perceptual decisions and behavioral responses are critical for serial dependence in orientation discrimination.
The Clock-Cycle (CLK-CYC) heterodimer is a key circadian transcription complex in Drosophila, with CYC having a DNA-binding domain and CLK having a transcriptional activation domain. However, most of CLK-CYC's transcriptional activity comes from CLK's glutamine-rich region. A CYC-viral protein 16 (VP16) fusion protein was created to study the role of transcription in core circadian timekeeping. The addition of VP16 to CYC significantly enhances the transcriptional activity of CLK-CYC, leading to increased levels of CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs and a short period, indicating that circadian transcription contributes to core circadian function. This suggests that the timing of transcriptional activation, not just the activation itself, is critical for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies. These findings highlight the importance of transcription in circadian rhythms and their regulation in Drosophila.
The horizontally acquired pmrD gene in Salmonella enterica activates the ancestral PmrA/PmrB two-component system, promoting transcription of PmrA-dependent genes and conferring resistance to polymyxin B. In Escherichia coli, the pmrD gene cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system, and this has been attributed to the highly divergent E. coli PmrD protein. However, it has been shown that the E. coli PmrD protein can activate the PmrA/PmrB system in Salmonella, suggesting that these two species differ in an additional component controlling PmrA-P levels. Further investigation revealed that the E. coli PmrB displays higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella PmrB, and this difference is due to a specific PmrB subdomain. Replacement of the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog was sufficient to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions. These findings suggest that quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of orthologous ancestral proteins can dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits and that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral loci. The pmrD gene was likely horizontally acquired and its expression is controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system in both Salmonella and Escherichia. However, the PmrD protein functions in Salmonella but not in Escherichia, and this has been attributed to differences in the phosphatase activity of the PmrB protein towards PmrA-P between the two species. This demonstrates that an ancestral protein can control the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer new traits and that quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of ancestral proteins can dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer a selective advantage upon a recipient organism.
A novel statistical approach has been developed to identify differentially expressed genes at the early stages of cell differentiation, demonstrated through the differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mES) into embryoid bodies (EB). The Differentiation-Test is based on the observation that the variance of measured expression of a gene in a mixed cell population increases as compared to its variance before differentiation, due to differences in the percentage of parental and descendent cells across biological replicates. The Differentiation-Test was applied to a dataset of mES cells differentiated into EBs, and the top 200 differentially expressed genes of 4-day and 8-day EBs were identified. These gene lists showed significant overlap with a benchmark gene list obtained through fluorescence activated cell sorting, indicating the accuracy of the Differentiation-Test. The test was able to detect differentially expressed genes in a very early stage of the differentiation process, providing consistent results to those obtained from a laborious experimental procedure of cell sorting. The Differentiation-Test can identify novel self-renewal regulators, as demonstrated through the study of two transcription regulators detected by the Differentiation-Test, Smarcad1 and Pias2. Smarcad1 was found to be an important sequence-specific transcription regulator for maintaining the pluripotency of ES cells. This research highlights the potential of statistical methods in identifying differentially expressed genes during cell differentiation and their regulatory roles, providing a valuable tool for understanding the mechanisms of differentiation.
Gene functional analysis is important in next-generation sequencing studies to understand the function of many genes and their classification to pathways, which are often unknown. Functional associations between genes are inferred from large-scale omics data, such as protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression networks. However, these data can be affected by confounding bias, leading to false positive findings. This issue is addressed in a study that presents an integrative method for discerning molecular pathways relevant to complex disease by examining functional associations between human genes from diverse data types and assessing them with a novel phenotype-based method. The study finds that controlling for confounding bias, such as coding-sequence length in the case of de novo gene variants, is crucial in identifying functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease. The method presented in the study is found to be superior in identifying functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias, demonstrating its suitability for functionally clustering variant genes underlying polygenic disorders.
In January 2014, the Mexican government implemented an 8% tax on nonessential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) to prevent continued increases in obesity and diabetes. This study, using data from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services, analyzed the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014. The results showed that the mean volume of purchases of taxed foods in 2014 changed by -25g (95% CI = -46, -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1% change beyond what would have been expected based on pre-tax (2012-2013) trends, with no corresponding change in purchases of untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased on average 10.2% less taxed foods than expected, medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods, whereas high SES households’ purchases did not change. The main limitations of the findings include the inability to infer causality, the sample being only representative of urban areas, having only 2 years of data prior to the tax, and not capturing all foods purchased by the household. Household purchases of nonessential energy-dense foods declined in the first year after the implementation of Mexico’s SSB and nonessential foods taxes.
The article discusses the role of power laws in brain functions and their potential underlying mechanisms. A model of collision-sensitive neurons, specifically the Lobula Giant Movement Detector Neuron (LGMD), is presented, which assumes noisy information channels with response thresholds. The model obtains an approximative power law as a result of pooling these channels, and it successfully predicts many response characteristics of the LGMD. The results depend critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway but are robust against noise in the excitatory pathway.The article also explores the role of noise in the nervous system, which is usually considered unwanted but can be used to solve computational problems. For example, a suitable amount of noise can help push otherwise undetectable signals across the response threshold of a neuron, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. Noise can also smooth the threshold behavior of a neuron and transform contrast-invariant, orientation-tuned input to cortical simple cells into contrast-invariant spike tuning.Furthermore, the article proposes that threshold smoothing may occur at the single neuron level, where noisy and thresholded (pre-synaptic) inputs are integrated by the dendritic tree of a neuron. This property is used in a computational model aimed at explaining many characteristics of the LGMD neuron.In summary, power laws describe brain functions at various levels, and they may be generated by similar underlying mechanisms. Noise, which is prevalent and unavoidable in the nervous system, can be used to solve computational problems and play a crucial role in transforming signals in the visual system. The LGMD neuron, which responds best to objects approaching one of the locust's compound eyes on a direct collision course, can be modeled using a biophysically plausible model with noisy information channels and response thresholds, which obtains an approximative power law as a result of pooling these channels. The results depend critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway but are robust against noise in the excitatory pathway.
Cameroon's National Buruli Ulcer Control Program (NBUCP) began in 2002, with the goal of reducing suffering and morbidity associated with the disease. The program has seen significant achievements, such as a decrease in case detection rates from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants between 2001 and 2014, and an increase in the number of endemic health districts from two to 64. The program also established five diagnostic and treatment centers, with two more planned. However, there are still challenges, namely insufficient resources and funding. The program relies heavily on partner resources, but these are becoming increasingly scarce, resulting in cuts to activities and decreased performance indicators. The Cameroon government provides limited funding for recurrent costs, but it is not enough to cover the gap. The NBUCP aims to detect cases early, particularly non-ulcerative forms and category 1 lesions, and to treat all active cases according to standard guidelines. However, there is a lack of diagnostic and management skills for BU among health personnel, as BU is not taught in all medical faculties and training schools. Research is also needed to answer outstanding questions about BU, such as the mode of transmission and the relationship between BU and HIV/AIDS. While progress has been made, resource mobilization is needed to expand and scale up program activities.
The paper investigates the impact of outcome valence on confidence while learning stimulus-outcome associations through trial-and-error. The experiments reveal that participants were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance in both contexts. This bias is driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average expected-value of choice options. The biasing effect of context-value on confidence has functional consequences, such as differing flexibility in learning strategies in volatile environments depending on outcome valence. Despite similar behavior, profound asymmetries may exist between learning to avoid losses and seeking gains. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding confidence and its biases in reinforcement learning.
Alphaviruses, enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses with a 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated genome of approximately 11.5 kb, can cause serious disease in humans and domestic animals. Alphavirus RNA replication takes place in membrane invaginations that protrude from the inner surface of the host cell plasma membrane and from the outer surface of endosomes and lysosomes. The replication complexes contain as essential components the virus-encoded nonstructural proteins nsP1-nsP4, which arise through cleavage from a polyprotein precursor P1234. The functions of nsP3 have remained more obscure, although mutations in it affect various steps of RNA synthesis. The N-terminus of nsP3 contains a structurally conserved protein domain termed the macro domain, which is capable of binding ADP-ribose derivatives and RNA, and also hydrolyzing ADP-ribose-1''-phosphate. The C-terminus of alphavirus nsP3 contains a 'tail' region, which varies in length between ~150--250 amino acid residues in different alphavirus and is devoid of predicted secondary structure. The tail region has been implicated in the virulence of alphaviruses. Some regions of the tail are also heavily phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, and in Semliki Forest virus (SFV), deletion of the phosphorylated region gave rise to a virus that replicated well in cell culture but was apathogenic in mice. In this study, a carboxyterminal proline-rich sequence motif shared by many alphaviral nsP3 proteins was found to serve as a preferred target site for the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains of amphiphysin-1 and -2. Upon alphavirus infection, the intracellular distribution of amphiphysin was dramatically altered and colocalized with nsP3. Mutations in nsP3 disrupting the amphiphysin SH3 binding motif as well as RNAi-mediated silencing of amphiphysin-2 expression resulted in impaired viral RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SFV. Infection of Balb/c mice with SFV carrying an SH3 binding-defective nsP3 was associated with significantly decreased mortality. These data establish SH3 domain-mediated binding of nsP3 with amphiphysin as an important host cell interaction promoting alphavirus replication.
Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin caused by melanized fungi, particularly members of the order Chaetothyriales. A study was conducted to assess population diversity among 123 clinical strains of the disease in Brazil using sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region and partial cell division cycle and β-tubulin genes. The study found that the strains were limited to three clusters divided over the single family Herpotrichiellaceae known to comprise agents of the disease. The Fonsecaea cluster contained the most important agents, with F. pedrosoi being prevalent at 80% of the total set of strains, followed by F. monophora, F. nubica, and a single isolate of F. pugnacius. Additional agents were located among members of the genus Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora, with frequencies of 3% and 1%, respectively. The infection is assumed to occur through accidental inoculation of the fungus via contaminated plant debris, and is one of the most frequent implantation mycoses found among rural populations. Clinically, the disease is characterized by pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with epidermal microabscesses and dermal granulomata. The disease has a slow evolution, but may result in disfigurement of affected body sites. The initial lesion is noted as a small pink papule at the site of inoculation which gradually enlarges, developing into large papillomatous and verrucous warts.
Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that causes the foodborne disease listeriosis, is capable of manipulating the host's cells to its advantage during infection. Upon infection, L. monocytogenes induces DNA breaks and activates the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway, but the bacterium is able to dampen the activation of the DNA-damage signaling pathway through the bacterial factor Listeriolysin O (LLO). LLO induces the degradation of Mre11, a major sensor of DNA damage, through a mechanism independent of proteasome degradation. This dampening of the DDR is important for infection as inhibition of proteins implicated in this pathway increases bacterial infection. Additionally, L. monocytogenes induces an increase in γH2AX levels during infection both in tissue-cultured cells and in mice. The LLO toxin prevents H2AX phosphorylation, which is a crucial step in the DDR, and is a potent inhibitor of the DDR. The LLO toxin dampens the DDR downstream of DNA breaks and reduces the level of γH2AX and the number of 53BP1 foci during infection. Peritoneal infections of mice with either the wild type or Δhly mutant L. monocytogenes confirmed these in vitro observations, showing that LLO prevents phosphorylation of H2AX. Furthermore, LLO dampens the DDR induced by known cytotoxic agents such as etoposide or irradiation. The bacteria's ability to dampen the DDR is important for its virulence and survival within the host.
The human Herpes Simplex Viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, are common pathogens that cause various diseases, with HSV-1 primarily causing cold sores and HSV-2 being a major factor in sexually transmitted infections. Both viruses infect epithelial cells and establish latency in sensory neurons. While much is known about HSV replication, the molecular machinery responsible for its regulation remains elusive. A study was conducted to identify factors affecting HSV infection by screening an epigenetic compound library and discovered that BRD4, a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal family, plays a critical role in HSV infection. BRD4 is an epigenetic reader that recruits transcriptional regulatory complexes to acetylated chromatin and participates in host gene regulation. The study found that bromodomain inhibition enhances HSV infection by promoting transcription factor association with HSV gene promoters. Specifically, treatment with JQ1, a BD1 inhibitor, acts through BRD4 protein, and suppressing BRD4 expression or inhibiting CDK9 activity impedes HSV infection. The study demonstrates that BRD4 is a modulator for JQ1 action on HSV infection and has an essential role in HSV infection.
Noma, or cancrum oris, is a devastating gangrenous oral infection that primarily affects malnourished children in developing countries, causing severe facial disfigurement. The exact cause of noma is still unknown, but it is thought to be triggered by a complex mix of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and weakened immune system. A recent study aimed to understand the microbial ecology of noma by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons from sixty samples of gingival fluid from healthy children and those suffering from noma or Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG). The study found that samples taken from lesions in diseased mouths were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted for Proteobacteria, regardless of whether the samples were taken from noma or ANG lesions. However, samples from noma mouths did not have a higher abundance of Fusobacterium, casting doubt on its role as a causative agent of noma. The study also identified several Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in the Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales as indicators of noma, suggesting that one or more microbes within these Orders is associated with the development of noma lesions. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding the microbial communities associated with noma and the need for further research into the role of these microbes in the development of this devastating disease.
Quorum sensing is a communication system used by bacteria to coordinate adaptation properties, cell fate, or commitment to sporulation. The infectious cycle of Bacillus thuringiensis in the insect host is a powerful model to investigate the role of quorum sensing in natural conditions. It is tuned by communication systems regulators belonging to the RNPP family and directly regulated by re-internalized signaling peptides. One such RNPP regulator, NprR, acts in the presence of its cognate signaling peptide NprX as a transcription factor, regulating a set of genes involved in the survival of these bacteria in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of NprX and independently of its transcriptional activator function, NprR negatively controls sporulation. NprR inhibits expression of Spo0A-regulated genes by preventing the KinA-dependent phosphorylation of the phosphotransferase Spo0F, thus delaying initiation of the sporulation process. This NprR function displays striking similarities with the Rap proteins, which also belong to the RNPP family, but are devoid of DNA-binding domain and indirectly control gene expression via protein-protein interactions in Bacilli. Conservation of the Rap residues directly interacting with Spo0F further suggests a common inhibition of the sporulation phosphorelay. The crystal structure of apo NprR confirms that NprR displays a highly flexible Rap-like structure. A molecular regulatory mechanism is proposed where key residues of the bifunctional regulator NprR are directly and alternatively involved in its two functions. NprX binding switches NprR from a dimeric inhibitor of sporulation to a tetrameric transcriptional activator involved in the necrotrophic lifestyle of B. thuringiensis. NprR thus tightly coordinates sporulation and necrotrophism, ensuring survival and dissemination of the bacteria during host infection.
Achieving effective treatment for HIV, which cannot currently be cured, involves combination treatment with multiple anti-retroviral drugs due to different viral genotypes for each individual patient. Computational models have been developed to predict an optimal treatment regimen for an individual patient, with current models based solely on sequence data derived from viral genotyping and not considering chemical similarity of drugs. A study applied proteochemometric (PCM) models, combining chemical and protein target properties in a single bioactivity model, and found they performed better in resistance classification and prediction of Log Fold Change compared to previously published sequence data. PCM models were able to accurately predict the phenotypic resistance based on genotypic data even for novel mutants and mixtures, with an applicability domain informing the user about the reliability of predictions. This is crucial as mutations in the viral genome occur frequently, with even single point mutations having the potential to cause insensitivity of HIV to treatment with all members from an entire drug class. Occurrence of these resistance-conferring mutations can be contained or minimized by the nature of HAART therapy due to the combination of multiple drugs classes, but the occurrence of high impact mutations can cause treatment failure in HAART for certain specific drug regimens. Therefore, it is crucial that the drug regimen is tailored to the specific viral genotype, with knowledge of the effect of individual mutations on the efficacy of different drugs required for a tailored drug regimen. Computational methods, such as PCM models, have been shown to perform equal to phenotypic assays and significantly better in patients experiencing drug failure.
"Eukaryotic chemotaxis, the movement of cells towards a source of attractants, is a biologically important and theoretically interesting process that has been widely studied. The traditional understanding of this mechanism is that attractants cause actin polymerization leading to pseudopod formation and cell movement. However, a new proposed mechanism suggests that pseudopods are made by a self-generated cycle, with chemoattractants modulating the cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization. A computational model based on this pseudopod-based mechanism has been found to reproduce a wide range of existing data about cell movement and chemotaxis, predicting both bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients and lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients. These findings suggest that an intrinsic pseudopod cycle lies at the heart of cell motility, implying that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behavior, more than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants. Previous models have considered chemotaxis to be driven by a ""compass"" mechanism, where there is a localized signal representing the direction of the chemoattractant gradient, causing new pseudopods to be made towards attractant sources. However, it has been found that simple generation of new pseudopods cannot explain observed cell steering and that, unless gradients are very steep, new pseudopods are usually more strongly controlled by internal dynamics than by chemoattractants. A ""pseudopod-centred"" mechanism has been proposed as an alternative, where each cell's direction is entirely represented by the pseudopods themselves. Directional migration is accomplished by biasing the cycle of pseudopod generation and retraction, rather than simply at the level of new pseudopod initiation."
Fleas can transmit Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). EPT occurs when fleas transmit Y. pestis immediately after taking an infectious blood meal, while BDT occurs when Y. pestis accumulates in the flea's proventriculus and is transmitted to the host through regurgitation. A study examining the mechanism of EPT and the effect of host blood on it found that fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood were more likely to reflux a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 hours of feeding, a phenomenon called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). This correlated with increased numbers of Y. pestis CFU transmitted by Oropsylla montana. When fleas fed on bacteremic rat blood, they were more likely to become partially blocked and transmit Y. pestis within a time frame typically attributed to EPT. The study suggests that the relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of rats and Sciurids and the slower digestion of their blood promotes regurgitative transmission, which may be one reason why these rodents are particularly prominent in plague ecology.
"The study of neural population codes has traditionally focused on the detrimental effects of positive correlations on coding performance. However, this study shows that positive correlations can significantly enhance coding performance by suppressing the probability of discrimination error and increasing the number of stimuli encoded. These effects do not require unrealistic correlation values and can occur in populations with a few tens of neurons. The benefits of positive correlations are further amplified by heterogeneity commonly seen in population activity. A pattern of correlation can lead to a ""lock-in"" of response probabilities, eliminating variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus discrimination. These findings are particularly relevant for understanding the neural basis of perception, as they demonstrate that correlations in neural activity can support high-fidelity coding and rapid perception. The study also highlights the potential benefits of positive correlations for neural population codes and suggests new experimental tests for identifying the proposed pattern of correlation."
A conjugate vaccine for cholera, prepared via squaric acid chemistry from the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba strain PIC018 and a recombinant heavy chain fragment of tetanus toxin (OSP:rTTHc), was assessed for immune responses in mice. The vaccine induced prominent anti-OSP and anti-TT serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses following intramuscular or intradermal vaccination. Intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses targeting OSP occurred following intradermal vaccination. The vaccine was found to be protective in a mouse survival cholera challenge model. The development of an effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high level and long-term immune responses against OSP would be beneficial, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. Cholera is a severe, dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae, with approximately 3-5 million cases and 100,000-130,000 deaths globally each year. Vaccination against cholera can assist in control measures until safe water and adequate sanitation become a reality for those most at risk for cholera.
The Immunochromatographic card test (ICT) is a tool used to map the distribution of Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasite causing lymphatic filariasis (LF), a vector-borne disease affecting millions worldwide. The study investigates the cross-reactivity of ICT when mapping LF in areas with contrasting endemicity levels of loiasis and mansonellosis in Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 villages across three regions of the Cameroon rainforest domain, and blood samples were collected from 2190 individuals for the detection of circulating filarial antigen (CFA) by ICT and assessment of Mf using a thick blood smear. The study found that ICT positivity was strongly associated with high L. loa prevalence and intensity (Mf/ml of blood) at the individual level. These results suggest that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results are high levels of L. loa. The findings may indicate that W. bancrofti is much less prevalent in the Central African region where L. loa is highly endemic than previously assumed and accurate re-mapping of the region would be very useful for shrinking of the map of LF distribution.
"Positive-strand RNA viruses, a large group that includes human pathogens such as SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), replicate in the cytoplasm of infected host cells, with their replication complexes associated with modified host cell membranes. These membrane structures include distinct spherular membrane invaginations and elaborate webs of packed membranes and vesicles. A unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum, consisting of convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), and ""vesicle packets"" apparently arising from DMV merger, has been implicated in SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits, while double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. The formation and function of these membrane-associated replication complexes, or ""viral factories,"" are not yet fully understood, but they are thought to facilitate the concentration of viral macromolecules, provide a membrane-based structural framework for RNA synthesis, coordinate different steps in the viral life cycle, and delay the induction of host defense mechanisms. Understanding the structure-function relationships that govern the membrane-associated replication of positive-strand RNA viruses will enhance our general understanding of their molecular biology and may have important implications for the development of novel antiviral control strategies."
The article presents a study on the role of suberin in the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana in controlling water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves. The study used the enhanced suberin1 (esb1) mutant, which has increased root suberin, to establish a connection between suberin and both water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in the shoot. The results showed that esb1 mutants had reduced daytime transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during their vegetative growth period. Additionally, the changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreases in the accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn and increases in the accumulation of Na, S, K, As, Se, and Mo in the shoot. These findings provide direct genetic evidence that suberin in the roots plays a critical role in controlling both water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves. The changes observed in the elemental accumulation in leaves are also interpreted as evidence that a significant component of the radial root transport of Ca, Mn, and Zn occurs in the apoplast. Overall, the study highlights the importance of suberin in regulating water and solute transport in plants, and the potential for suberin-modified plants to be used in improving water-use efficiency and mineral nutrition in crops.
The single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction is regulated by the dynamics of R* during its lifetime, including the random number of phosphorylations, catalytic activity, and random sojourn time at each phosphorylation level. Despite this randomness, the SPR is highly reproducible, but the mechanisms that confer such low variability are not completely understood. A Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction, was used to investigate the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation. The results showed that only the randomness of the sojourn times in each of the phosphorylated states contributes to the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the response, whereas the randomness of the number of R\* turnoff steps has a negligible effect. This indicates that R\* shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of the second messengers acts as a variability suppressor. The activation/deactivation module of the cascade is not experimentally separable from the transduction module, but a mathematical model is used to analyze the randomness of each phosphorylation state of R\*. The dynamics of R\* deactivation regulates the production of cGMP and therefore the current response. Following isomerization, a molecule undergoes a random number of phosphorylations by rhodopsin kinase (RK) and finally is inactivated by arrestin (Arr) binding. Activated rhodopsin keeps activating its cognate G-protein (G) transducin while its catalytic activity declines with increasing level of phosphorylation. The active G-protein (G\*) associates with the effector protein phosphodiesterase (E) forming an active G-GPE complex, which by hydrolyzing cGMP reduces its concentration, thereby generating a current response on the outer shell of the ROS. The SPR exhibits a low variability in the sense that the amplitude and shape of the electrical responses, corresponding to a set of activation-deactivation events, are similar. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the SPR area for mouse is about 0.35. However, the mechanisms that confer high reproducibility of the SPR are not completely understood, and several studies attribute the high reproducibility of the SPR mainly to the mechanisms regulating rhodopsin deactivation. Rhodopsin inactivation can occur by several mechanisms, including Arr binding and thermal decay to opsin, but the former occurs on a much longer time scale. Shutoff of R\* by Arr binding can follow an infinite number of paths, depending on the random number of phosphorylated states, and the random sojourn times in those states.
A new mathematical framework has been developed to uncouple a stochastic reaction network from its dynamic environment, allowing for the analysis of a system's behavior within a fluctuating extrinsic environment. This framework is crucial for understanding the behavior of low-copy molecule biochemical systems, which require mathematical models that account for intrinsic stochasticity. Recent studies have shown that intrinsic noise alone cannot account for the substantial phenotypic variability among isogenic cells and that extrinsic noise, or fluctuations in the intracellular environment, represent an additional source of variability. The new framework allows for the marginalization of fluctuating extrinsic components, such as chemical species, into a decoupled model with its own process-and master equations. The approach has been shown to be significant through several case studies. The development of this framework will aid in turning stochastic modeling and simulation techniques more large-scale and more faithful to in vivo conditions, where significant environmental fluctuations are present. It can also be used in the model-based design of novel circuit motifs in synthetic biology and the analysis of how environmental stochasticity is propagated along coupled reaction networks.
A novel closed-loop BMI training architecture, adaptive optimal feedback-controlled (OFC) point process filter (PPF), has been developed to enable BMI control at the time-scale of spike events and allow for dynamic adaptation of decoder parameters with every spike event. The architecture incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control model of the brain’s behavior in closed-loop BMI control and a point process model of spikes. The OFC model infers the user’s motor intention during CLDA, and is used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders. Closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate showed that the OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared with current intention estimation techniques, OFC assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control, spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared with batch-based methods, and was robust to parameter initialization. The architecture extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training. These results have significant implications towards the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics.
The study investigates the impact of stimulus structure on redundancy in the retina by measuring simultaneous responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells presented with natural and artificial stimuli that varied in correlation structure. The results showed that responding to spatio-temporally structured stimuli such as natural movies, pairs of ganglion cells were modestly more correlated than in response to white noise checkerboards, but they were much less correlated than predicted by a non-adapting functional model of retinal response. The study found that stimuli with purely spatial correlations, pairs of ganglion cells showed increased correlations consistent with a static, non-adapting receptive field and nonlinearity. The study's findings suggest that the retina dynamically adjusts its coding strategy to represent new stimulus classes efficiently, and temporal processing plays a key role in maintaining the level of output correlations. The study also found that a fixed linear filter is largely sufficient to explain the effect of spatial correlations, whereas higher-order processing is necessary to suppress the impact of temporal stimulus correlations on output correlation. The study's data and stimuli are publicly available online for further research.
Genetic interactions, which occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype, are important for predicting function, dissecting protein complexes into functional pathways, and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common human diseases. Although synthetic sickness and lethality are the most studied types of genetic interactions in yeast, only a small proportion of gene pairs have been tested for genetic interactions due to the large number of possible combinations. To expand the set of known synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, a new integrative multi-network approach has been developed. This approach, which significantly improves upon existing approaches, defines a large number of features for characterizing the relationships between pairs of genes from various data sources and uses these features to develop a non-parametric multi-classifier system for predicting SL interactions. This allows for the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures and leads to an improved performance when compared to the current state of the art method. This approach has been used to derive the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network and to predict SL interactions between all non-essential gene pairs in yeast. This integrative approach is expected to be more effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions in yeast and higher organisms.
The BRCA Challenge, initiated within the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, is a long-term data-sharing project that aims to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support collaborative research activities. Its goal is to generate an informed and current understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across these iconic cancer predisposition genes. The project has integrated reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases into a single site, www.brcaexchange.org, to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. The BRCA Exchange has aggregated over 20,000 variants, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases, such as Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD), as well as population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together the existing international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium expert panel, along with expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, to advance the understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. The BRCA Challenge's ongoing work includes encouraging data sharing from national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data, developing methods for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engaging with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The BRCA Challenge is an essential initiative that aims to facilitate the sharing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to advance our understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk and to provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making.
Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium, is a significant global health threat, leading to about one million human deaths annually. Plasmodium has a complex life cycle in both humans and mosquitoes, requiring rapid adaptation to various environments. Maintaining redox balance is crucial for Plasmodium's survival, as it is constantly exposed to reactive oxygen species. A recent study systematically analyzed the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins in Plasmodium falciparum, creating the first complete map of redox compartmentation. Notably, two plasmodial peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase system were targeted to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. Alternative-translation-initiation (ATI) is used for differential targeting of two major antioxidant redox-enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase, possibly opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Malaria parasites are vulnerable to disruptions in redox equilibrium during their erythrocytic life stages, making these findings particularly relevant for drug development.
PUMA, a member of the BH3-only protein family, is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds to its cellular partner Mcl-1 through its BH3 motif, which folds upon binding into an α helix. A structure-based coarse-grained model with an explicit Debye—Hückel charge model was used to study the importance of electrostatic interactions in the early and later stages of this model coupled folding and binding process. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity and shown to be consistent with previously published experimental data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength. The results suggest that intramolecular electrostatic interactions only marginally influence the unbound states of PUMA, while intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic interactions, are involved in the formation of the initial encounter complex. The simulation strategy provides residue level detail for the mechanism of this modeled coupled folding and binding process, including the role of non-native electrostatic contacts in the formation of the encounter complex. The study highlights the potential importance of such electrostatic interactions for describing the binding reactions of IDPs and could be used to provide predictions for the results of mutational studies.
Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain the silencing of key developmental genes outside of their expression domains. They localize in structures called Polycomb (PC) bodies within the cell nucleus and bind to specific PcG response elements (PREs) in the genome. Genome-wide analyses have shown that PREs form local and long-range spatial networks and PC bodies mainly correspond to 3D structural counterparts of the linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. Immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins have been used to analyze the formation and mobility of PC bodies during fly embryogenesis. These studies have shown that PC bodies and chromatin domains containing H2Av-GFP undergo long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories and each PC body and chromatin domain has its own fast and highly constrained motion. PC bodies move within volumes slightly larger than those of condensed chromatin domains and both types of domains move within volumes much smaller than chromosome territories, restricting their possibility of interaction with other nuclear structures. The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains observed during early embryogenesis decreases in late developmental stages, indicating a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics in the maintenance of stable gene silencing. The binding of regulatory factors to chromatin and specific post-translational histone modifications are crucial for the biological mechanisms that allow one genome to translate into the many epigenomes that characterize different cell types. In Drosophila, PcG proteins are recruited to chromatin through PRE sequences which can be located several tens of kilobases away from their target genes. PREs recruit the PRC2 complex, which trimethylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a mark that is recognized by PcG proteins of the PRC1 complex, such as PC and PH, to bring about gene silencing. H3K27me3 and its associated silencing mediated by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play a crucial role by repressing key developmental regulators in embryonic stem cells.
MtDNA mutations are implicated in the aging process, but there is no universally accepted method for their accurate quantification. Ultra-deep sequencing was used to study genome-wide mtDNA mutation load in the liver of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. MtDNA point mutation loads were 10-times-higher in mtDNA mutator mice, who also had increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule and decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. However, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occurred at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice, indicating they do not drive the premature aging phenotype. Most somatic mtDNA mutations in mice occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life. A decline of mitochondrial function has been observed in a variety of aging mammalian tissues, but the relative contribution of each of the different types of mtDNA mutations to the aging process remains unknown.
The anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum utilizes glutamate decarboxylation to create a transmembrane sodium ion gradient, which is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via an F1Fo-ATP synthase containing a novel sodium recognition motif. This is shared by other human pathogens. The rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, has been shown through molecular modeling, free-energy simulations, and X-ray crystallography to specifically recognize sodium ions. The c-ring features two carboxylates for ion binding, which allows for a proton to be concurrently bound to all sites, although sodium ions alone drive the rotary mechanism. This new mode of ion coupling in ATP synthases provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen. The ATP synthase is a crucial enzyme for ATP synthesis in biological cells, and this study elucidates the specific mechanism of sodium ion coupling in the ATP synthase of F. nucleatum.
In the initiation of adaptive cellular immunity, the recognition of foreign peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules on antigen presenting cells (APCs) by αβ T cell receptor (TCR) is crucial. High-affinity binding and/or long-lived interactions between TCRs and pMHC in vitro have been shown to correlate with high-potency T cell activation. However, less is known about the influence of TCR/pMHC interaction parameters on T cell responses in vivo. A study was conducted to understand this by tracking CD4+ T cell activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of TCR/pMHC half-lives and in vitro T cell activation potencies. The study found that optimal in vivo T cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate TCR/pMHC half-lives. The diminished in vivo responses observed to the ligand exhibiting the longest TCR/pMHC half-life were associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function over a broad range of time points. These results reveal a level of control over T cell activation in vivo not recapitulated in in vitro assays and highlight the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands as part of vaccine design.
Nectria haematococca, also known by its asexual name Fusarium solani, is a member of the Fusarium solani species complex, a group of over 50 phylogenetic species capable of colonizing various environments, including forests, scrub communities, savannahs, prairies, swamps, littoral zones, coastal zones, deserts, and even highly radioactive inner parts of damaged nuclear reactors. N. haematococca MPVI, one of the members of this complex, has a diverse range of habitats due to its genetic plasticity and metabolic diversity, with genes on supernumerary chromosomes contributing to its adaptability. These supernumerary chromosomes have more repeat sequences, are enriched in unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content compared to other chromosomes. The genome of N. haematococca MPVI has 17 chromosomes and a physical size of 54.43 Mb, the largest reported for ascomycetes. Its genome encodes 15,707 genes, with many of these genes not present in other fungi or present as multiple copies, possibly resulting from gene duplication events or horizontal gene transfer. These additional genes may account for individual isolates having different environmental niches and contribute to the species' diverse range of habitats.
The egress of newly assembled herpesvirus particles from infected cells is a dynamic process involving the host secretory pathway and viral components. A live-cell fluorescence microscopy method was developed to visualize the final transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus (PRV) particles in non-polarized epithelial cells using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. This method revealed that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small acidified secretory vesicles, which undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis near patches of LL5β, part of a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. Rab GTPases, key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway, are present on the virus secretory vesicle. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress and contribute to our understanding of the interactions between viruses and host cells.
A study was conducted to examine the impact of Enterobius exposure on the composition of gut microflora and its interactions with the host immune responses in a prospective cohort of 109 primary school-aged children. The children were divided into pinworm-negative and pinworm-positive groups, and stool samples were collected from the pinworm-infected individuals before and after administration of mebendazole. The results showed that pinworm infection and mebendazole deworming were associated with a decreased relative abundance of Fusobacteria and an increased proportion of Actinobacteria at the phylum level. At the genus level, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment. The intestinal SIgA level was found to be lower in the pinworm-infected group, and was increased in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. The study suggests that childhood exposure to pinworm plus mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria including the probiotic Bifidobacterium, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria. The gut SIgA level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, and was increased in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. The immunomodulatory roles of helminth have been well studied, and it has been suggested that helminth infections may increase intestinal bacterial diversity and alter the composition of microbiota. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota is suspected as causing T helper type 1 (Th1) responses in Trichuris muris infections in mice, and Schistosoma mansoni has been suggested to cause Th1-mediated inflammation and granuloma formation via alteration of microbiota. Therefore, the net immunomodulatory effect of pinworm on an individual may be dependent on its interaction with that individual’s intestinal microbiota.
The genetic basis of complex traits, such as root length in Arabidopsis thaliana, is often studied using the assumption that most genetic variance is additive. However, a study examining the genetics of A. thaliana root length found that the genomic narrow-sense heritability for this trait was statistically zero, indicating that the genetic variation is not due to additive effects but rather epistatic interactions. Four interacting pairs of loci were revealed, involving seven chromosomal loci, but these were not detected using standard additive-model-based genome-wide association approaches. The use of statistical epistasis analyses was indispensable for confirming known and identifying new candidate genes for root length in this population of wild-collected A. thaliana accessions. This study highlights the importance of considering non-additive variation and using statistical epistasis approaches to fully understand the genetic architecture of complex traits. The current quantitative genetics paradigm is based on the assumption of additive gene action, but there is increasing evidence that non-additive effects are crucial to many, if not most, biological systems. Despite this, the focus on additive variation alone can leave a considerable amount of genetic variance unexplored. Statistical epistasis has been shown to be pervasive in both humans and model organisms, but epistatic contributions to complex traits have primarily been identified using candidate gene approaches and QTL mapping. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses have emerged as an effective method for mapping loci underlying phenotypic variation, but GWA analyses to detect epistatic interactions are still under-utilized. GWA analyses to detect epistatic interactions are important for identifying novel loci, enhancing sensitivity in statistical analyses, selecting the most promising analytical approaches and experimental designs, and providing insights into the genetic and biological mechanisms that can lead to non-additive genetic variance and genotype-phenotype relationships. Public resources have been developed for studying genotype-phenotype associations with GWA analyses in model organisms such as A. thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster. However, there are challenges in using epistatic interactions in natural populations, including the cost and time to collect large datasets, the lack of power due to noisy phenotypes, and the difficulties in performing necessary follow-up studies to replicate the epistatic associations.
In this study, researchers analyzed over 30,000 human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to examine the relationship between inherited mtDNA mutations and genetic background. They found that the clinical presentation of certain pathogenic mtDNA mutations is associated with a specific background mtDNA haplogroup, and that mutations tend to be more frequent on younger sequences and in genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations. The researchers also found that mutations were more common on specific haplogroup backgrounds, either due to a founder effect or recurrent mutation events within the same phylogenetic cluster. These findings suggest that the mtDNA background plays a role in recurrent mutation events that have been purified through natural selection in older populations, which could explain the low frequency of mtDNA disease reported in specific ethnic groups. Overall, this research highlights the importance of considering the genetic background when studying mtDNA mutations and their associated diseases.
In collective cell migration, cells move in a coordinated manner for various biological functions such as immune system development, early embryo development, and cancer invasion. Cell-cell interactions can create new dynamics not seen in individual crawling cells, such as fingering instabilities, emergent chemotaxis, and leader cells. Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) is a well-studied cell-cell interaction where a cell changes direction after contact with another cell. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in the coordination of collective migration in various systems. To analyze CIL in vitro, collision assays are used, where the velocity of pairs of cells before and after collision is measured. However, these assays can have low efficiency due to rare cell-cell collisions. Recent studies have developed 1D collision assays, where cell motion is restricted to an adhesive micropatterned stripe, increasing efficiency and ensuring a reproducible collision geometry. These assays can help study outcomes of cell-cell collisions and identify critical molecular mediators of CIL. In this context, a computational model was developed to evaluate the chemical and mechanical factors that control the interactions of motile, eukaryotic cells exhibiting CIL on narrow micropatterned stripes. The model, based on a phase field technique, simulates a large number of cell-cell collisions on narrow micropatterned stripes to probe which properties in the cell-cell interactions are responsible for the different outcomes observed in experiments. The model considers cell polarity, interface tension, and bending modulus, as well as cell-cell adhesion and volume exclusion. Chemical concentrations within the cell are modeled with reaction-diffusion equations, while for Rho GTPase Rac dynamics, a minimal model is used to describe the dynamics of a polarity protein. CIL is incorporated through the assumption that cell-cell contact leads to local generation or activation of a Rac inhibitor. The simulations can reproduce all experimental observed cell-cell collision cases (reversal, sticking, walk past, and chaining) by varying only four parameters: adhesion strength σ, critical overlap Ocrit, and the CR and FR strengths kCR and kFR. The relative importance of these parameters and their impact on the collision outcomes are further explored through parameter sweeps, with a focus on the width of the adhesive stripe, d, which can be easily varied in experiments. The modeling results predict that varying d strongly affects the walk-past transition, revealing that decreasing the stripe width can strongly decrease the walk-past rate, and this transition is sharp. Overall, the computational model provides insights into the mechanical and chemical factors that control cell-cell interactions during collisions, which can help understand and manipulate collective cell migration in various systems.
The dissociation mechanism of thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complexes has been a topic of debate for over twenty years. A specific point of contention is the activation of the nucleophilic cysteine as a thiolate during the dissociation of the complex. A study using the complex between Trx and its endogenous substrate, arsenate reductase (ArsC), as a model found that conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx, activating it for nucleophilic attack. Cys32Trx was found to be more reactive than Cys82ArsC and directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx and not on Cys89ArsC. This information provides new insights into a universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism that results in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx. Thioredoxin is a powerful and universal protein disulfide bond oxido-reductase with a very low redox potential. It has a conserved active-site loop containing two redox-active cysteine residues. These cysteines have a low pKa, which enables thioredoxin to act as a nucleophile, attacking disulfides in proteins. Arsenate reductases (ArsC) are endogenous substrates of Trx and are involved in arsenic detoxification. ArsC catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite and involves a phosphatase-like nucleophilic displacement reaction in the active site with a distinct intra-molecular disulfide-bond cascade. After a single catalytic arsenate reduction event, oxidized ArsC exposes a disulfide between Cys82 and Cys89 on a looped-out redox helix. Thioredoxin converts oxidized ArsC back to its initial reduced state through a series of reactions involving mixed disulfide intermediates. The exact mechanism behind the regioselectivity of these reactions is not fully understood and is the subject of ongoing research.
A study was conducted to examine the uncertainty and updating of tastes in temporal discounting, the extent to which a person prefers a temporally proximal reward over a distal one. The study used the 'Delegated Interpersonal Discounting (DID)' task, which involves three phases: in phase 1, subjects made a series of temporal discounting decisions; in phase 2, they learned to make choices expressed by another simulated participant; and in phase 3, they made more choices for themselves and the other. The study found that participants' choices were better accounted for by a random-taste model than by a response-noise model and that their apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model taking into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. The findings have neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental significance, as they suggest that people can learn about their tastes by considering evidence such as the preferences of relevant others and updating their beliefs accordingly.
"In budding yeast, filamentous growth is a complex differentiation response that occurs under specific environmental conditions and is regulated by multiple pathways, including the RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG pathways. A novel screening approach, secretion profiling, was used to identify new regulators of filamentous growth by measuring the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2p, the signaling mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth (FG) MAPK pathway. The results showed that many of the pathways that regulate filamentous growth are also required for FG pathway activation, sensitizing the FG pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizing it to the global signaling network. Several of the regulators were required for MSB2 expression, identifying the MSB2 promoter as a target ""hub"" where multiple signals converge. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3p positively regulates FG pathway activity and filamentous growth by further regulating accessibility to the MSB2 promoter. These findings provide the first glimpse of a global regulatory hierarchy among the pathways that control filamentous growth, and systems-level integration of signaling circuitry is likely to coordinate other regulatory networks that control complex behaviors. In metazoan development, a network of interactions between evolutionarily conserved pathways like Notch and EGFR coordinates every facet of cell growth and differentiation, and miscommunication between pathways is an underlying cause of diseases such as cancer."
A study was conducted to understand the role of changes in gene expression in the evolution of divergent morphologies using a model system of five filamentous fungi in the Sordariomycetes. The fungi were cultured in a common garden environment, and genome-wide gene expression was profiled at five developmental stages. Ancestral gene expression phenotypes were reconstructed, and genes with the largest evolved increases in gene expression across development were identified. Knockouts and phenotypic analysis of two divergent species demonstrated altered fruiting body development in the species that had evolved increased expression. This evolutionary approach proved to be more efficient than other gene deletion studies in identifying relevant genes. Combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes facilitated the refinement of Bayesian networks of genes underlying fruiting body development.Changes in gene regulation have been argued to play a greater role than changes in protein function in the evolution of complex phenotypes. Many examples of interspecies variation in the phenotype of gene expression have been identified, many of which can be linked to the evolution of higher, more complex phenotypes. Estimation of gene expression phenotypes in ancestral lineages provides a means of identifying putative changes in gene expression that may be key to morphological and adaptive innovation. Identification of the changes in the genetic network architecture underlying altered ancestral expression and regulation could open up the “black box” linking genotype to phenotype through development, revealing relevant gene network modularity and identifying the origins of diversity.Genomic techniques for measuring gene expression offer the opportunity to comprehensively evaluate the relationship of gene expression to morphology. Fungi represent a great model for addressing this challenge as they are typically heterotrophic generalists, genome sequences of a large number of fungal species are now available, genes are well annotated, and experimental validation can be performed on many fungi via functional approaches.The fruiting bodies of fungi offer a degree of multicellular developmental complexity, including tissue differentiation, that represent a good model for more complex multicellular eukaryotes. The genetics of sexual development in the ascomycetous filamentous fungi has been studied extensively using saprotrophic model organisms such as Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, and Sordaria spp. and in the plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum. Neurospora and Fusarium species belong to the orders Sordariales and Hypocreales, respectively, of the Sordariomycetes and produce complex, flask-shaped fruiting bodies called perithecia.The fruiting bodies harbor the meiospores (ascospores) within cellular sacs called asci, which function as cellular cannons to forcibly discharge spores into the air. Asci are formed from ascogenous hyphae, products of mating in self-incompatible species or self-fertilization in self-compatible species. Thus, fruiting bodies have a role in sexual recombination but also provide an effective means to local and long-distance dispersal.The ecology of Neurospora and Fusarium spp. provides an opportunity to relate developmental evolution to their ecology. Perithecia of Neurospora spp. and Fusarium spp. have retained shared common features such as the ascus structure. While transcriptional and morphological divergence among N. crassa, N. tetrasperma, and N. discreta and between F. graminearum and F. verticillioides have been previously examined, the two genera have not been compared.The genera differ significantly in morphology. Fusarium spp. feature a noticeable stroma: a mass of often darkly pigmented pseudoparenchyma tissue from which the perithecia emerge. In contrast, the perithecia of Neurospora lack a stroma. In addition, the ontogeny of the paraphyses differs between the two genera. Neurospora species develop an extended ostiole, or ‘beak’, while Fusarium species do not.The evolution of new phenotypes requires alteration of the developmental process, which in turn requires alteration of interactions within and among gene modules. Reverse genetics can be guided by genomic assays, such as gene expression profiling, and provide contextual clues to gene interactions and modules that are relevant to phenotypes and their evolution.In this study, comprehensive profiling of gene expression across developmental stages has been conducted in three species of Neurospora and two species of Fusarium. Gene expression levels were measured during perithecium development in Neurospora spp. and Fusarium spp. Of the 4668 single copy orthologs, one or more reads were identified for 4490 orthologs for all five species across all sample points for all stages.Fundamental cellular processes exhibited common patterns among sister species. For instance, mitochondrial ribosomal gene expression was upregulated during initial stages of perithecial development, and expression of nuclear ribosomal genes peaked during formation of the asci.Hypothesizing that genes whose expression increased substantially in one lineage during divergence of Fusarium and Neurospora are important to the evolution of morphological differences between these genera, genes were ranked in each lineage by differences in expression between the most recent common ancestor of the two Fusarium species and the MRCA of the three Neurospora species, providing a candidate gene knockout prioritization list.Knockouts of genes that recently underwent an increase in expression were hypothesized to exhibit phenotypes during sexual development, in particular at the stages of morphological divergence where the increase occurs. Therefore, the stage of each knockout phenotype obtained was defined as the first stage in which a definitive aberrant phenotype was observed.In F. graminearum, knockouts of genes that recently underwent an increase in expression exhibited phenotypes during sexual development, in particular at the stages of morphological divergence where the increase occurs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence for the role of changes in gene expression in the evolution of divergent morphologies using a model system of five filamentous fungi in the Sordariomycetes. The findings demonstrate the utility of combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes to refine the understanding of the genetic networks underlying fruiting body development. Understanding the genetic basis of morphological evolution is a fundamental question in biology, and the findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic diversity.
Schistosomiasis is a tropical disease for which current control efforts rely heavily on the drug praziquantel. However, the large genomes of schistosomes and the limitations of in vitro culture systems pose challenges for genetic manipulation and germ line transgenesis. A recent study investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules into eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. The study found that electroporation was more effective than soaking alone for transduction of schistosome eggs by messenger RNA encoding luciferase and by pseudotyped retrovirus virions. Transgenes were successfully introduced into the schistosome egg, with electroporation resulting in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in larval schistosomes compared to soaking alone. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis. Despite the abundance of schistosome genome sequence data, functional analysis of potential target genes is not yet possible. The development of reliable methods for reverse genetics in schistosomes is a key goal for future research. The entire developmental cycle of human schistosomes cannot be maintained in vitro, but laboratory maintenance of the developmental cycles of all three human schistosomes can be accomplished using rodents as the mammalian host and the intermediate host snails. Schistosome eggs can be obtained from livers of experimentally infected rodents, and miracidia obtained from these eggs are infectious for the intermediate host. In vitro culture of eggs is possible for at least one week. The study explored the introduction of transgenes and other macromolecules into eggs of S. mansoni by square wave electroporation and found that electroporation was more efficient than soaking alone. This research underscores the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.
The Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model is a novel approach for studying the dynamic responses of large macromolecular assemblies in cells, which are important for biological processes. The PMT model monitors the responses of all residues simultaneously across many decades of time until equilibrium is reached, using a Krylov subspace projection method. This approach can yield rich information about the system, including the identification of pivot residues that are important for macromolecular movement, messenger residues that are key to signal mediation, and anchor residues that are important for binding interactions. The PMT model has an accuracy of 71-84% in predicting the functionally important residues in the GroEL-GroES chaperone system. The PMT model is a useful tool for studying the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies, including virus capsid and ribosomal complex, and can be applied to other systems.
Fungal galectin, CGL2 from Coprinopsis cinerea, inhibits development, reproduction, and causes death in Caenorhabditis elegans. This toxicity depends on the interaction between CGL2 and a fucose-containing glycoconjugate, specifically a Galβ1, 4Fucα1, 6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores. A novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of this glycoepitope was identified. CGL2 toxicity is dependent on its ability to bind carbohydrates, and the phenotype of CGL2-mediated nematotoxicity is similar to the intoxication of C. elegans induced by feeding with E. coli cells expressing the nematicidal pore-forming crystal toxin Cry5B from Bacillus thuringiensis. The ligand of C. cinerea galectins in C. elegans is different from the Cry5B-ligand but its biosynthesis also relies on fucose biosynthesis. A forward genetic screen for mutations conferring CGL2-resistance in a pmk-1 ( km25 ) mutant genetic background was performed to identify the target glycoconjugate of CGL2 in C. elegans, yielding Mos1-insertions in five different genes: bre-1, ger-1, gly-13, fut-8 and M03F8 . 4. The identified Mos1-insertions are located in 5′-untranslated regions, at an exon-intron junction, and in exons. bre-1 and ger-1 code for the GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase, respectively, catalyzing the two enzymatic steps in the conversion from GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. fut-8 encodes the only fucosyltransferase capable of transferring fucose in α1, 6-configuration from GDP-fucose to the asparagine-linked GlcNAc in C. elegans N-glycan cores. Gly-13 codes for the major GlcNAc-transferase I (GnTI) in C. elegans, which transfers GlcNAc in β1, 2-configuration to the α1, 3-linked mannose of pentamannosidic N-glycan. The modification of N-glycans by GnTI is the prerequisite for many of the subsequent modifications of N-glycans including the action of core α1, 6-fucosyltransferase. In C. elegans, GnTI is not required for the core modification by another fucosyltransferase, encoded by the fut-1 gene, which forms the so-called HRP epitope consisting of fucose α1, 3-linked to the core asparagine-linked GlcNAc.
The existence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells is the major barrier to curing HIV. These reservoirs, which are established soon after infection and are long-lived, can lead to delayed evolutionary dynamics within a single host, with longer delays associated with larger relative reservoir sizes and/or homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. This delay can fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale, allowing for the evolution of intermediate viral loads consistent with maximizing transmission. This effect can be further enhanced if viruses similar to those that initiate infection are preferentially transmitted. These results depend strongly on within-host characteristics such as the relative reservoir size, with the evolution of intermediate viral loads observed only when the within-host dynamics are sufficiently delayed. Therefore, the latent reservoir has important and hitherto under-appreciated roles in both within- and between-host viral evolution.
The paper explores the interaction between viruses and the host's T cell response, with a focus on coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). The study uses transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as sensors to evaluate CVB3's antigen presentation in vitro and in vivo. The results show that CVB3 inhibits antigen presentation via the MHC class I pathway, thereby evading CD8+ T cell immunity. However, MHC class II presentation remains unencumbered, leading to phenotypically normal in vivo CD4+ T cell responses. These memory CD4+ T cells expand dramatically following challenge infection and differentiate into secondary effector cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines. The study has implications for the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during CVB3 infection and the in vivo efficiency of cross-priming. Most viruses are readily detected by host T cells and induce strong T cell responses, but CVB3's ability to evade T cell responses is not complete, and its impact on the host's T cell responses is far from complete. CVB3 is a significant human pathogen that causes severe acute and chronic diseases, particularly in infants, young children, and immunocompromised individuals. It is the most common cause of infectious myocarditis, pancreatitis, and aseptic meningitis. The study's ultimate goal is to map T cell epitopes in the virus and enhance the ability to detect and analyze CVB-specific T cell responses.
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, affecting the skin and peripheral nerves. Type 1 reactions (T1Rs) are a major cause of nerve function impairment (NFI) in patients with leprosy, affecting up to 30% of susceptible individuals. They may occur during multi-drug therapy or after completion and are characterized by acute inflammation in skin lesions or nerves or both. T1Rs are treated with oral corticosteroids, but there are few data to support the optimal dose and duration of treatment. A study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of three days of high-dose (1 g) intravenous methylprednisolone at the start of prednisolone therapy in leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Forty-two individuals were randomized to receive methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone or oral prednisolone alone. The study found that individuals treated with methylprednisolone were less likely than those treated with prednisolone alone to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study. The study also demonstrated that 50% of individuals with Type 1 reactions and/or nerve function impairment required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids. These findings suggest that more prolonged courses of corticosteroid may be necessary to treat Type 1 reactions and that further investigation is needed to identify risk factors for the recurrence of Type 1 reaction and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment.
In chronic HIV infection, Treg from HIV infected patients (Treg/HIV+) have a defect in modulating both the differentiation and the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 T cells, which may contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses. Treg/HIV+ showed a reduced ability to inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell function and HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells, but inhibited IFN-γ expression of autologous CD8+ T cells stimulated with recall CMV/EBV/Flu antigens. Treg/HIV+ had a lower capacity to suppress HIV-specific CD8+ T cells compared to Treg from HIV-negative controls. These defects in Treg function in HIV infection, along with decreased responsiveness of effector clones and high levels of PD-1/PD-L1 expression, may contribute to the ultimate failure to contain generalized HIV-1–associated immune activation. The impairment in Treg function is specific to HIV-infected individuals and may play a role in HIV pathogenesis.
The lymphatic filarial parasites can survive in the human body for years, thanks to the immunomodulatory strategies they adopt, one of which is the release of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) that counteract the oxidative free radicals produced by the host. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of parasite GSTs as vaccine candidates against lymphatic filariasis. The GST gene was cloned from the third stage larval (L3) cDNA libraries of Wuchereria bancrofti and recombinant GST (WbGST) was expressed and purified. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed, and it was found that sera from endemic normal individuals (EN) carry significant levels of anti-WbGST IgG antibodies compared to subjects who are microfilaraemic (Mf) or show symptoms of clinical pathology (CP). Vaccine potential of rWbGST was evaluated in a jird model, and it was found that approximately 61% protection could be achieved against a B. malayi challenge infection in jirds immunized with rWbGST. Therefore, rWbGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne infection caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or Brugia timori that affects 120 million people in 73 countries, and another 1.1 billion people are at risk. Despite the availability of excellent anti-filarial drugs, several rounds of mass treatment are necessary to reduce the levels of infection below those necessary to sustain transmission. Therefore, additional preventive measures such as vector control and vaccine development are crucial to control the infection in endemic regions. A protective role for immunization with GSTs from several helminth parasites has been established, and the schistosome 28 GST has been successfully developed into a vaccine against S. mansoni and S. bovis. The mechanisms underlying the protection conferred following immunization with S. mansoni 28 GST appear to be due to an inactivation of the GST enzymatic activity. Thus, neutralizing the activity of GST may be a strategy to induce protection against certain parasitic infections. Immunization of mice with Fasciola gigantica GST26 could confer from 77–84% protection against challenge infection in mice. Therefore, GST appears to be a critical protein for the survival of the parasite in the host. Based on homology sequences, Nathan et al. constructed the 3D structure of W. bancrofti GST (WbGST) and predicted sites for docking of GST inhibitors as a new approach to develop drugs against W. bancrofti. These studies suggest that WbGST may be a promising target for vaccine development. Therefore, in this study, the vaccine potential of filarial GST was evaluated.
CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have revolutionized genome editing in experimental organisms and hold immense therapeutic potential. However, concerns about off-target effects remain a challenge. Recent studies have used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of gene-edited embryos or animals to search for de novo mutations (DNMs) as potential off-target changes. However, these studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish generational or colony-related differences from true DNMs. A new study used a trio design and whole-genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, where 10 of the embryos were mutagenized with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. The study's findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggest that if CRISPR mutagenesis were causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos, the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes. The results support further efforts to develop CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapeutic tool. The study was performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Research Support Facility under Home Office licensed authority, adhering to the UK Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
The stomatal pores present on plant leaf epidermis regulate CO2 uptake for photosynthesis and water loss by transpiration, affecting photosynthesis, water use efficiency, and agricultural crop yields. Blue light, one of the environmental signals that regulates stomatal aperture, is perceived by cryptochromes and phototropins, which activate signal transduction cascades leading to stomatal opening response. Two new players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), have been identified in the control of stomatal aperture. Both HRB1 and PP7 are expressed in guard cells and interact through the N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif of HRB1 and the catalytic domain of PP7. Blue light increases HRB1 phosphorylation and complex size, but in the pp7 mutant, HRB1 is predominantly phosphorylated, and the size shift is impaired. These findings suggest that HRB1 phosphorylation by PP7 under blue light is essential for proper conformation or the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex, providing strategies for plants to enjoy the advantages of both constitutive and ABA-induced protection under water-limiting conditions.
The Mediator complex is a coregulator of RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression in eukaryotes, and the Caenorhabditis elegans Mediator subunit MDT-1
"A recent study used a simple model of hippocampal activity and computational tools from algebraic topology to investigate the formation of a topological connectivity map from neuronal spiking patterns. The researchers varied three parameters in computer simulations of rat trajectories in three topologically and geometrically distinct test environments: firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons. They found that the patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. The simulations revealed a ""learning region"" that highlights the interplay between the parameters in combining to produce hippocampal states that are more or less adept at map formation. The researchers propose that this learning region provides a coherent theoretical lens through which to view conditions that impair spatial learning by altering place cell firing rates or spatial specificity. The study suggests that the hippocampus creates a topological connectivity map derived from place cell co-firing patterns, and that the information contained in the spike trains is qualitative in nature and can be studied using topological techniques. The researchers hypothesize that although the hippocampal connectivity map could contain additional space encoding mechanisms for geometric information, experiments have demonstrated that smooth geometric variations of the environment produce continuous stretches of the place field layouts that preserve the relative timing between spikes, so that the temporal pattern of spiking remains largely invariant with respect to geometric transformation."
The current model of HCV production involves the assembly of virions on lipid droplets, envelopment at the ER, and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements and molecular mechanisms of HCV secretion are not fully understood. An RNAi analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion, combined with live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking, was conducted to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress. RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER-Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the TGN, VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. Live cell imaging revealed that HCV core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. Sub-populations of HCV core co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome, and silencing of the recycling endosome component Rab11a results in the accumulation of HCV core at the Golgi. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles. This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress, while presenting dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells. HCV is a positive-strand RNA virus that contains a single-stranded genome of approximately 9600bp. The genome is translated into a polyprotein, which is processed by viral and host proteases into 3 structural proteins (core and the glycoproteins E1 and E2) and 7 non-structural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B). The NS proteins are involved in viral RNA replication and host cell interactions, as well as HCV assembly. NS2 is a central regulator in capsid assembly and acts as a scaffold to coordinate interactions between the structural and non-structural proteins leading to viral RNA encapsidation. Capsid envelopment occurs at the ER in close juxtaposition to lipid droplets (LDs), and HCV particles are infectious upon envelopment and appear to be secreted from the cell in association with distinct lipid and apolipoprotein associations. The egress of HCV through the secretory pathway is less clear, but it is distinct from the flaviviruses in that HCV particles are infectious upon envelopment and appear to be secreted from the cell in association with distinct lipid and apolipoprotein associations. HCV particles circulating in the blood of infected patients are rich in triglycerides, ApoB, and ApoE, and cell culture-derived virus also has a broad range of buoyant densities, with the lower density fractions containing virus highly infectious virus. Purified HCV virions have diverse morphologies ranging from 30-125 nm and a lipid composition resembling very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). The VLDL synthesis pathway has been implicated in infectious HCV secretion. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or inhibitors that target components of VLDL synthesis, including microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, ApoB, and ApoE inhibit infectious HCV secretion. This study is a continuation of two previous RNAi studies in which membrane trafficking pathways were interrogated for their roles in HCV entry and replication. A unique siRNA library was used to identify siRNAs that inhibited infectious extracellular HCV accumulation in a primary screen and then re-tested in secondary assays to identify the stage of the life cycle that they influenced. Genes involved in entry had a secondary phenotype in inhibiting HCVpp infection and genes involved in HCV replication had a defect in subgenomic replicon replication. The primary screen was performed by electroporating four individual siRNAs per gene into Huh-7.5 cells and then allowing silencing for 48 or 72 hours before infection with HCV. Viral supernatants were collected at two days
In this study, the role of imprinted genes in tumorigenesis was examined using mice with heterozygous mutations in the Neurofibromatosis I tumor suppressor gene (NF1) to model radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms. Expression analysis of tumor cell lines established from these mouse models identified Grb10 expression as widely absent. Grb10 is an imprinted gene, and polymorphism analysis of cell lines and primary tumors demonstrated that the expressed allele is commonly lost in diverse Nf1 mutant tumors. Functional studies revealed that Grb10 restoration in Nf1 mutant tumors decreases proliferation, decreases soft agar colony formation, and downregulates Ras signaling. Additionally, Grb10 loss independently promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which promotes hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. These findings suggest a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis and demonstrate that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin.
A study was conducted to investigate human autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlovian fear conditioning, a type of associative learning. The study used a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses, specifically skin conductance responses (SCR) and pupil size responses (PSR). Three experiments were conducted, and a probabilistic learning model best explained ANS responses for both SCR and PSR. The SCR tracked a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR tracked expected outcome alone. The study provides evidence that the formation and maintenance of Pavlovian threat predictions in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty. These findings could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning.
The septation initiation network (SIN) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are two essential signaling pathways in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, involved in cell growth, reproduction, and response to environmental stress. The SIN pathway, composed of a SepH kinase cascade, plays a crucial role in septation and conidiation, while the MAPK pathway depends on a successive signaling cascade phosphorylation to sense and respond to stress and environmental factors. A recent study identified a SepH suppressor, PomA, in A. nidulans, which acts as a negative regulator of septation and conidiation. The pomA mutant can cure defects of sepH1 in septation and conidiation, and overexpression of pomA significantly suppresses septation. Under normal cultural conditions, SepH positively regulates the phosphorylation of MAPK-HogA, while PomA reversely affects this process. In the absence of PbsB, PomA and SepH are unable to affect the phosphorylation level of HogA. Under osmotic stress conditions, induced phosphorylated HogA is capable of bypassing the requirement of SepH, but not the whole SIN requirement. These findings suggest that crosstalk exists between the SIN and MAPK pathways, and PomA and SepH indirectly regulate HogA phosphorylation through affecting HogA-P upstream kinases. Overall, this study provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the SIN and MAPK pathways in fungal cells and the crosstalk between these two pathways.
Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) is widely distributed in 98 countries, with approximately 1.5 million people affected annually and Brazil being one of the six countries with the highest incidence. TL is endemic in all regions of Brazil, with the highest incidence in the northern region, including the Amazon rainforest, where seven species of Leishmania have been identified. TL clinical manifestations range from cutaneous to mucosal and diffuse leishmaniasis. While the pathogenesis of TL is not fully understood, recent studies suggest that the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) in Leishmania (Leishmania) braziliensis and Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis is associated with the severity of mucosal leishmaniasis (ML). A study of 156 patients with various forms of TL in Rondonia, Brazil, found that 77.6% were infected with L. braziliensis, 11.5% with L. guyanensis, and 1.8% with L. lainsoni. LRV1 was detected in L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. amazonensis, and L. lainsoni. A case-control study of 147 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and ML found that the relative risk of patients with positive LRV1 mucosal lesions (39.30%) was 2.93 times higher than those with negative LRV1 mucosal lesions (12.30%). However, other factors, such as the genetic characteristics of the host and parasite virulence, may also contribute to the emergence of mucosal lesions. Studies with clinical follow-up are needed to confirm the involvement of the virus in the pathogenesis of the disease and the possible role of LRV in the metabolism of the parasite.
Streptococcus pneumoniae infections can lead to bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Type I interferon (IFN-I) plays a role in host defense against pneumococci by preventing bacteria from transmigrating from the lung to the blood. Mice that lack the IFN-I receptor or are treated with a neutralizing antibody against the IFN-I receptor develop bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection, while mice treated with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA show reduced bacteremia. IFN-I upregulates tight junction proteins and downregulates the pneumococcal uptake receptor, PAF receptor, reducing pneumococcal cell invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers. Pneumococci can migrate from the nasopharynx to the lungs, and IFN-I regulates both receptor-mediated transcytosis and pericellular migration of pneumococci across epithelial barriers. The IFN-I family consists of multiple IFNα and a single IFNβ protein, which promote an anti-inflammatory response during infection. IFN-I production depends on pneumococcal uptake and the presence of pneumolysin in macrophages and intracellular bacterial DNA and NOD2 in lung epithelial cells. Intranasal administration of IFNβ protects mice against systemic disease following intranasal infection with pneumococci.
A study demonstrates the capability of neural networks with a single plastic layer utilizing reward modulated spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) in learning simple foraging tasks. The research further explores the use of a network of spiking neurons with multiple plastic layers for advanced pattern discrimination and continuous learning. The network utilizes both reward modulated and non-reward modulated STDP, and implements multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization of rewarded STDP, and hard limits on synaptic strength. The study finds that the addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing non-rewarded STDP creates neurons that respond to specific combinations of inputs, performing basic classification of the input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network is able to learn discrimination between rewarding patterns and those designated as punishing, even in the absence of labeled training data. The network is able to learn and respond to an ever changing environment. Biologically inspired neural networks can perform sophisticated information processing similar to the human and animal brains. Most learning models employ Hebbian type learning principles, but the most promising model of learning at the synaptic level is spike time dependent plasticity (STDP), where the synapse increases or decreases in strength based on the firing of presynaptic and post synaptic cells. Heavily studied is the visual sensory pathway, but the stages at which visual learning occurs and the plasticity mechanisms operating at different processing steps are still a matter of controversy. Most learning models have been successful without considering cellular level mechanisms, but a deeper understanding of how learning at the cellular level gives rise to learning at the level of animal behavior is still needed. The study provides important insights into the properties of a spiking neuronal network with STDP that is sufficient to solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision making.
During pregnancy, the ETS transcription factor ELF5 establishes the milk-secreting alveolar cell lineage in the mammary gland by driving a cell fate decision in mammary luminal progenitor cells. In breast cancer, ELF5 plays a crucial role in determining tumor subtype and has been implicated in the development of insensitivity to anti-estrogen therapy. In a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, increased ELF5 levels drove metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system, specifically by recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and promoting vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. These findings suggest that ELF5 may be a defining factor in the acquisition of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer, which is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes that predict differential clinical outcomes based on shared patterns of gene expression and mutation.The cell of origin, including the basal ER- and luminal ER+ breast cancer subtypes, plays a crucial role in determining the phenotypic dichotomy between ER+ and ER- cancers. The ETS transcription factor ELF5 is a key determinant of cell fate decisions made by mammary progenitor cells and is influenced by hormonal control and paracrine signals. In luminal breast cancer cells, a mutual negative-regulatory loop occurs between ER and ELF5, while ER- basal breast cancers are characterized by high ELF5 levels and stem-cell–like claudin-low subgroups do not express ELF5. Knockdown of ELF5 levels in luminal breast cancer cells has a small effect on proliferation, but a much greater effect is seen in ER- basal cell lines. Importantly, ELF5 levels rise in luminal breast cancer cells that acquire antiestrogen resistance, and resistant cells become dependent on ELF5 for their proliferation, providing an escape pathway from inhibition of proliferation by antiestrogen therapy and facilitating disease progression.ELF5 influences phenotypic plasticity, which regulates the acquisition of invasive and motile characteristics to cancer cells. The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the interaction between the tumor and the host immune system. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of immature neutrophils that have been identified as mediators of vasculogenesis and metastasis. In the MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary model of breast cancer, increased TGF beta signaling caused MDSC recruitment to primary tumors, which delayed the development of lung metastases when depleted and increased the number of lung metastases when tumor cells were co-inoculated with MDSCs.In a mouse model of mammary-specific ELF5 expression in the context of luminal mammary cancer, induced ELF5 expression produced tumors that were detected earlier but took longer to reach the ethical endpoint. Forced Elf5 expression reduced cancer cell proliferation, motility, invasion, and mesenchymal characteristics, corresponding with reduced primary tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary cancer model. However, induction of ELF5 caused widespread tumor hemorrhage, resulting in higher vascular density with finer and more branched vessels, elevated CD31 endothelial cell content, and increased blood vessel permeability. The ability of Elf5 to induce an angiogenic response in the PyMT tumors was analyzed using an independent experimental system, which revealed an aberrant leaky vasculature. Induction of ELF5 greatly increased the amount of PyMT-mRNA present in blood, suggesting increased numbers of circulating tumor cells. Elf5's metastasis-promoting effect was comparable to that produced by pregnancy in this model. In vivo, these effects are coupled with the immune system, indicating the importance of the immune system in the ELF5-driven response.
Recent experiments reveal that chromatin looping interactions are not local but can involve multiple loops, playing a role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. A mechanistic model is proposed to address how changes in connection patterns, distance between regulatory elements, and communication forms of interacting DNA loops affect variability in expression level systematically. The model shows that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, while alternating loops reduce mean expression but increase noise compared to side-by-side loops. The facilitated-tracking mechanism performs better than the direct looping mechanism in enhancing or reducing expression and reducing or enlarging noise, depending on connection patterns, but this control or tuning is distance-dependent, particularly for moderate loop lengths. Experiments suggest that living organisms or cells use the facilitated-tracking mechanism to deal with information about their environments. The rates of chromatin looping, affected by the distances between regulatory elements, also play crucial roles in gene expression.
Metabolic engineering often relies on RNA technology to customize metabolism and maximize production. Pure riboregulators enable dynamic gene repression without the need for coexpressed proteins, unlike Hfq binding small RNAs and CRISPR technology. However, there is a lack of clear design principles for developing de novo repressing riboregulators. To address this, translation inhibiting RNAs were developed from scratch, exploring features related to thermodynamics and structure. After defining 12 structural and thermodynamic features and removing correlations, 18 riboregulators were selected, constructed, and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions. The pure riboregulators showed repression down to 6% of original protein expression levels, and a partial least squares regression model was constructed to link the properties of translation inhibiting RNA riboregulators to gene repression. Overall, this approach allows more reliable forward engineering of effective pure riboregulators, expanding the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation. Over the last decade, synthetic biology and systems biology have led to advances in metabolic engineering, enabling economically competitive production processes for bulk and fine chemicals from renewable resources. Tuning cellular metabolism is necessary to redirect the metabolic flux towards the product of interest. Traditionally, this has been done through gene deletions, but maximizing various production pathways requires tools able to specifically reduce gene expression. Various metabolic engineering efforts have used CRISPRi technology to successfully repress specific genes, ameliorating the desired product formation. Alternative approaches to control gene expression on the translational level employ small RNAs to repress protein production by blocking translational initiation, enabling metabolic flux redirection at will. However, these approaches rely on coexpressed proteins, which might cause increased metabolic burden, long-term genetic instability, and unexpected behavior. Gene expression modulation systems that solely rely on RNA are preferred, as they require less cellular resources and harness large potential for the construction of fast-responding RNA circuitry. Pure riboregulators, which do not require proteins, offer these advantages and have been successfully used to precisely downregulate specific genes, redirect metabolite fluxes towards the phenotype of interest, and construct RNA circuitry. Despite these benefits, practical applications of pure riboregulators result from thorough, laborious, inefficient, and impractical screening of multiple designs comprising hundreds of nucleotides. Therefore, a framework for the de novo design of pure riboregulators was proposed, which repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. This predictive framework enables forward engineering in a broader context and the construction of genetic circuitry using solely RNA.
The researchers in this study investigated the nature of transient associations among neurons that are believed to underlie memory and behavior. They recorded ongoing local field potential (LFP) activity at multiple sites within the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex. They found that when the composite activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a threshold, its activity pattern, as reflected in the LFP, occurs without distortion at other cortex sites via fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, which they call coherence potentials, extend up to hundreds of milliseconds and mark periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information much like action potentials at the single-cell level. However, coherence potentials have an additional degree of freedom in the diversity of their waveforms, which provides a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and allows identification of particular associations. Such nonlinear behavior is analogous to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks. The researchers suggest that this phenomenon of all or none, loss-less propagation of activity at high amplitudes arises by virtue of synaptic transmission and is akin to a 'tipping point' in the cortical network dynamics.
A study was conducted to identify factors involved in the correlation between nuclear size and cell size, a phenomenon that has been observed in various cell types, including unicellular yeasts and multicellular animals and plants. The study utilized fission yeast gene deletion mutants and identified 25 essential factors that alter nuclear size. The analysis implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in nuclear size control, revealing lower and more extreme higher nuclear size phenotypes. The study also identified global cellular processes and specific structural nuclear components important for nuclear size control. Historical evidence of a constant ratio between nuclear and cell size has been reported in various cell types, and this study provides further insight into the mechanisms that control nuclear size and its correlation with cell size.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor (ET), involving the application of a train of pulses with constant frequency via electrodes implanted into the brain. New closed-loop approaches aim to deliver stimulation according to ongoing symptoms or brain activity, potentially improving efficiency, efficacy, and reducing side effects. The success of closed-loop DBS depends on devising a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations in neural activity associated with motor disorders. A mathematical model describing how the brain oscillations should change when stimulation is applied at a particular state of the system is a useful stepping stone towards this goal. This paper focuses on using coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations and analyzes how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude, assuming certain conditions are met. The authors predict that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and more effective when applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. They compare this prediction with data obtained from ET patients and propose a new hybrid strategy that combines two closed-loop strategies found in the literature, namely phase-locked and adaptive DBS.
Schistosomiasis, caused by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, is a widespread disease affecting over 230 million people worldwide. The parasite's life cycle involves freshwater snails, particularly those of the genus Biomphalaria, which act as intermediate hosts. The development of new monitoring assays for large-scale screening of snails from transmission sites is crucial for snail control interventions related to schistosomiasis elimination. A LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) assay was developed and evaluated for the detection of S. mansoni in experimentally infected snails. The LAMP assay, named Biompha-LAMP, is specific, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective, making it suitable for large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas. The assay could be used to detect S. mansoni DNA in individual snails and pooled samples, providing a potential alternative for molecular xenomonitoring in field-applicable conditions. Animal procedures for the study complied with Spanish and European Union regulations, and experiments were conducted at an accredited Animal Experimentation Facility of the University of Salamanca. The study aimed to detect S. mansoni in Biomphalaria glabrata snails under different situations of infection, such as early prepatent period, light or low-grade infections, and in snails pooled samples. A simple, rapid, and economic method for DNA extraction from snails' tissues was successfully used. The LAMP assay presented here could be potentially useful for large-scale screening in searching infected snails with S. mansoni in field-applicable conditions.
Dengue is a major public health problem affecting over half of the world's population, particularly in Asia where it accounts for 70% of the estimated 390 million annual infections. In Sri Lanka, dengue is considered hyperendemic with all four serotypes in circulation for over 30 years. Historically, dengue was a less serious public health threat, but an abrupt increase in the number of severe cases occurred in 1989 and 2000 due to the emergence of new genotypes of the dengue virus. Dengue became a notifiable disease in 1996 and a National Dengue Control Program was set up in 1998. Despite these efforts, the number of reported cases increased 10-fold since the early 2000s, with large epidemics affecting the entire population of the island.In 2012, the Colombo district, the most heavily urbanized district in Sri Lanka, reported 10,017 hospitalized dengue cases. The public sector costs of dengue control activities and hospitalizations in Colombo district during the epidemic year of 2012 were estimated to be US$3.45 million (US$1.50 per capita). Personnel costs accounted for the largest shares of the total costs of dengue control activities (79%) and hospitalizations (46%). The per capita cost of dengue control activities was US$0.42, while the average costs per hospitalization ranged between US$216-609 for pediatric cases and US$196-866 for adult cases. This analysis is the first attempt to assess the economic burden of dengue response in the public health sector in Sri Lanka. Dengue poses a major economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka.
The relative contributions of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers and Neolithic farmers from the Near East to modern European populations have been a topic of intense debate. The commonest European Y-chromosomal lineage, R1b1b2 (R-M269), is carried by 110 million European men and increases in frequency from east to west. Previous studies suggested a Paleolithic origin for this lineage, but a new study shows that its geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity is best explained by spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic. This indicates that most European Y chromosomes originate in the Neolithic expansion, and highlights a unique role for males in the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming societies. The distribution of genetic diversity among modern European populations has been the subject of debate, with anatomically modern humans colonizing Europe from the Near East 40,000 years ago and adopting agriculture in the Near East 10,000 years ago. The spread of agriculture was accompanied by the development of sedentary populations and demographic expansion, and debated to be due to the movement and expansion of Near-Eastern farmers or to the transmission of cultural innovation to existing populations. A frequency cline of the R1b1b2 lineage follows a cline from 12% in Eastern Turkey to 85% in Ireland, and is currently carried by some 110 million European men. The geographical distribution of diversity within the haplogroup is best explained by its spread from a single source from the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic, indicating that the great majority of the Y chromosomes of Europeans have their origins in the Neolithic expansion. This reinterpretation makes Europe a prime example of how technological and cultural change is linked with the expansion of a Y-chromosomal lineage, and the contrast of this pattern with that shown by maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA suggests a unique role for males in the transition.
Recent studies on motor learning have examined the role of movement variability, which is the variation in performance across repetitions or continuous performance of the same task. This can be observed in various aspects of movement, such as errors in reaching or throwing, variance in force production, body sway during quiet standing and walking, the spread of movement trajectories, and variable coordination between effectors. While it is clear that motor variability is central to motor control and coordination, its role in motor learning is less understood. Some studies suggest that reduction of variability is a fundamental characteristic of learning, while others argue that initial variability can be beneficial for learning. However, it remains unclear whether initial variability generally facilitates motor learning, as motor learning is highly diverse and can be affected by multiple sources of noise and uncertainty. A recent study found that learners' initial variability is positively correlated with their rate of improvement, but this facilitatory effect of motor variability has not been consistently reported and its universality is questioned. Further research is needed to understand the relative importance of the factors involved in motor learning and to determine the conditions under which motor variability is beneficial or detrimental for learning.
NF-κB is a crucial transcription factor that plays a vital role in cellular immune and inflamory response, survival, and proliferation by regulating the transcription of various genes involved in these processes. RelA, a prominent NF-κB family member, interacts with transcriptional co-activators like CBP and p300 to activate transcription. The RelA:CBP/p3
The time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA) is a method for analyzing genomic data, specifically for longitudinal data, which is an extension of traditional gene set analysis methods used in cross-sectional studies. TcGSA is a hypothesis-driven method that relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates, allowing it to use all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random values. It identifies predefined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. This method has been shown to be more powerful than other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets, as demonstrated through its application to two real-life datasets and a simulation study. TcGSA is able to detect significant changes in gene expression over time within gene sets, even when standard univariate individual gene analysis and standard Gene Set Enrichment Analysis fail to do so. Overall, TcGSA is a valuable tool for the analysis of longitudinal genomic data.
The spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a neglected parasite causing malaria, is far less understood than that of P. falciparum, complicating control and elimination efforts. To address this, the first systematic effort was made to map the global endemicity of P. vivax, updating an earlier estimate of its transmission limits and using a spatiotemporal Bayesian model with 9,970 geopositioned P. vivax parasite rate surveys from 1985 to 2010. The study aimed to contribute to evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination by generating a comprehensive, detailed depiction of spatially varying endemicity.The results showed that the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission was 22% in the Americas, 3.5% in Africa (mostly in Madagascar and the Horn of Africa), 82% in Central Asia (home to 82% of global PAR or population at risk), and 9% in South East Asia. The endemicity was predicted within a narrow range throughout the endemic world, with point estimates rarely exceeding 7% PvPR1–99. Despite the Americas contributing to 22% of the global area at risk, high endemic areas were sparsely populated and the region accounted for only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk (PAR) globally. Africa's stable transmission was constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5% of global PAR. Central Asia had 82% of global PAR, with important high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations, particularly in India and Myanmar. South East Asia contained areas of the highest endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and contributed 9% of global PAR.This study demonstrated that detailed, geographically varying risk assessments can significantly contribute to a paradigm shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination. The international agenda for malaria control financing, research, and implementation has increasingly focused on regional elimination, and this ambition should extend to all human malarias, including P. vivax. However, recent years have seen minimal research attention and funding for P. vivax compared to P. falciparum. This neglect has led to the acknowledgment that control approaches for P. falciparum cannot be transferred successfully to P. vivax, as the latter frequently remains entrenched long after P. falciparum has been eliminated and can cause severe disease and death.Important factors contributing to the complexities in defining and mapping P. vivax endemicity include its dormant hypnozoite liver stage, lower parasitemia density, and the influence of the Duffy negativity phenotype. These factors require unique methodological considerations in mapping P. vivax endemicity, distinct from those established for P. falciparum. The study's efforts to accommodate these differences in developing a global distribution of endemic vivax malaria are a significant advancement in understanding and addressing this neglected parasite's spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution.
Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), resulting in millions of outpatient visits and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations in the US annually. The treatment of these infections has become difficult due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Vaccines offer a potential solution, but a universal anti-S. aureus vaccine is unlikely due to the wide spectrum of pathologies caused by the bacterium. Instead, a vaccine targeting specific clinical manifestations may be pursued. A vaccine specifically targeted against SSTIs would be of great benefit. If prophylactic vaccines or other forms of immunotherapy are to be developed as an alternative to antibiotics, a greater understanding of the specific role of individual virulence factors during infection at this site is needed to identify important targets for future therapy. S. aureus expresses up to 25 different cell wall-anchored (CWA) proteins, which are primarily involved in adhesion and invasion of host cells and tissues, biofilm formation, and immune evasion. Sortase A-deficient mutants, which lack the majority of cell surface bound CWA proteins, have reduced virulence in a murine kidney abscess model and a skin abscess model, indicating that CWA proteins are important during SSTIs. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the role of individual surface proteins during SSTIs. This study aimed to elucidate the role of Clumping factor B (ClfB) during S. aureus SSTIs and assess its potential as a candidate vaccine antigen specifically targeting SSTIs. The study found that ClfB affects both the rate of abscess formation and the overall size of the abscess formed, ultimately leading to greater bacterial burden in the skin. Additionally, recombinant loricrin loop L2v-GST was used to block the interaction between ClfB and its native ligands, resulting in reduced abscess lesion area and bacterial burden in the skin. A model vaccine containing ClfB was formulated with the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG as an adjuvant. Immunization with ClfB in combination with CpG drove a significant increase in ClfB-specific IFNγ, IL-17, and IL-22 CD4+ T cells by inguinal lymph node cells compared to CpG-immunized mice. Vaccination with ClfB in combination with CpG also induced significantly elevated ClfB-specific serum IgG titers in mice compared to the control group. These results identify ClfB as an important vaccine antigen that can drive effective humoral and cellular immune responses, ultimately leading to protection against S. aureus SSTI. These findings suggest that ClfB represents a good candidate antigen for inclusion in next-generation vaccines targeting S. aureus SSTI.
The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has set a goal to end AIDS by 2030, with an interim target of reducing new HIV infections to 500,000 by 2020. To achieve this, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is one of the proposed strategies, and Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only approved medication for this purpose. However, Truvada is expensive and requires daily adherence to a regimen, which can be a barrier for some individuals. Therefore, next-generation PrEP regimens, including long-acting formulations, are being investigated.To prioritize and help design PrEP regimens, tools are needed that integrate pharmacological, viral, and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. Researchers have developed a stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). By combining the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, they predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50- and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. They then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP “on demand,” and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before and after virus exposure.Their simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada and can prevent 99-100% of infections when used in PrEP, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events are missed. PrEP “on demand” prevented 79-84% of infections, and PEP >80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. The predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations.In conclusion, while HIV-1 remains a significant public health challenge, preventing its transmission is crucial. The 90-90-90 target aims to reduce new HIV infections to 500,000 by 2020, and PrEP is one of the strategies to achieve this goal. While Truvada is currently the only approved medication for PrEP, next-generation PrEP regimens, such as DTG, are being investigated. A stochastic simulation approach has been developed to predict prophylactic efficacy and help design PrEP regimens by integrating pharmacological, viral, and host factors. The simulations suggest that DTG is non-inferior to Truvada and can prevent 99-100% of infections when used in PrEP, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events are missed. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and continue the development of effective PrEP regimens.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major human pathogen that causes severe liver diseases. It induces autophagy in host cells to enhance its replication, but the mechanism by which HCV regulates the autophagic pathway is unclear. This report shows that HCV infection induces the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. The induction of Rubicon is prompt, while the induction of UVRAG is delayed, leading to the accumulation of autophagosomes in the early time points of viral infection. The HCV subgenomic RNA replicon, which expresses only nonstructural proteins, can also induce the expression of Rubicon and the accumulation of autophagosomes. Further analysis indicates that the HCV NS4B protein is sufficient to induce Rubicon and autophagosomes. Therefore, HCV temporally regulates the autophagic flux to enhance its replication by differentially inducing the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG.
Ccnyl1 is a newly-identified member of the cyclin family, highly similar in protein sequences to Cyclin Y (Ccny), but its function is poorly characterized. It is most abundantly expressed in the testis of mice, about seven times higher than the level of Ccny. Male Ccnyl1-/- mice were infertile, while both male and female Ccny-/- mice displayed normal fertility, indicating that Ccnyl1, but not Ccny, is essential for male fertility. Spermatozoa obtained from Ccnyl1-/- mice displayed significantly impaired motility, thin annulus region, and/or bent head. The protein, but not the mRNA, level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16) was decreased in the testis of Ccnyl1-/- mice. Further study demonstrated that CCNYL1 interacted with CDK16, increasing the stability and kinase activity of these two proteins, and altering the phosphorylation levels of CDK16. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of CCNYL1 in regulating spermatogenesis through the interaction and modulation of CDK16.
EHEC strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) due to toxin-mediated microvascular endothelial injury. EHEC hemolysin (EHEC-Hly), a member of the RTX family, is an important EHEC virulence factor. The toxin exists as free EHEC-Hly and as EHEC-Hly associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by EHEC during growth. Free EHEC-Hly lyses human endothelium, while OMV-associated EHEC-Hly triggers apoptosis of human brain microvascular endothelial cells and Caco-2 cells (intestinal epithelial cells) by targeting mitochondria. OMV-associated EHEC-Hly is internalized by HBMEC and Caco-2 cells via dynamin-dependent endocytosis and trafficked into endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification, EHEC-Hly escapes from the lysosomes and targets mitochondria, decreasing mitochondrial transmembrane potential and inducing apoptosis via the intrinsic caspase-9-dependent pathway. This novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases indicates a new mechanism for bacterial toxin entry into host cells to target mitochondria.
The elongation phase of transcription, where RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes genes in eukaryotes, is a critical point of regulation for many genes. While transcription initiation has been extensively studied, many of the mechanisms governing elongation are not yet fully understood. Transcription is accompanied by post-translational modification of nucleosomal histones in a highly conserved pattern. A central role in this interplay is played by mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1), which is catalyzed by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Bre1 in budding yeast. H2Bub1 is required for co-transcriptional generation of H3K4me by the methyltransferase Set1 in yeast and contributes to global H3K4me levels in metazoans. In vitro, H2Bub1 directly stimulates the activity of Set1 towards a reconstituted chromatin substrate. H2Bub1 also acts independently of histone methylation, playing a role in normal cell growth, morphology, and elongation by RNAPII at select target genes in fission yeast. Co-transcriptional histone modifications are regulated by a conserved subset of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) associated with the transcription machinery, including Cdk7 and Cdk9. In metazoans, Cdk9 activity overcomes promoter-proximal pausing imposed by unphosphorylated DSIF and a negative elongation factor, playing a role in regulating histone modification. P-TEFb binds the bromodomain protein Brd4 and phosphorylates multiple proteins important for elongation in mammals. Levels of H2Bub1, H3K4me, and H3K36me decrease after depletion of Cdk9 by RNAi or treatment with flavopiridol, an inhibitor of Cdk9 and related kinases. Bur1, the essential ortholog of Cdk9 in budding yeast, is required for co-transcriptional H3K36me and consequent action of the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex to prevent transcription initiation within coding regions. Budding yeast contains another, non-essential CDK, Ctk1, which is the major Rpb1-Ser2 kinase in vivo and is required for H3K36me. CDKs are themselves regulated by histone modification. For example, phosphorylation of histone H3 favors recruitment of P-TEFb, while certain histone marks work in opposition to specific CDKs during elongation. In fission yeast, the P-TEFb ortholog is the essential Cdk9/Pch1 complex, which phosphorylates the Rpb1 CTD at both Ser5 and Ser2. Inhibition of Cdk9 in vivo reduces the apparent stoichiometry of Rpb1 phosphorylation but does not cause selective loss of either Ser5 or Ser2 signals. Cdk9 also phosphorylates the CTD of fission yeast Spt5, which contains an exclusive, albeit nonessential, target of Cdk9 in vivo. Genetic epistasis suggests that Cdk9 and Set1 govern separate, partially redundant pathways downstream of H2Bub1. The htb1-K119R cells, which lack H2Bub1, display altered RNAPII distribution within gene coding regions. The phosphorylation by Cdk9 stimulates H2Bub1 and vice versa, and proper balance between the two is ensured via a positive feedback loop. Loss of H2Bub1 disrupts that balance and leads to deranged gene expression and aberrant cell morphologies, revealing a novel function of a conserved, co-transcriptional histone modification.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America and Africa, with an estimated 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths per year. Although a highly effective vaccine is available, the failure to implement sustained vaccination programs due to poverty, civil war, and inaccessibility of rural areas has led to an alarming resurgence of virus circulation in West Africa over the last 20 years. YFV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 11 kb, and is a member of the genus Flavivirus. Previous evolutionary studies suggest that YFV originated in Africa, but the timing and mechanism of its introduction to the Americas is less clear. A phylogenetic analysis of the largest YFV data set compiled to date, representing the prM/E gene region from 133 viral isolates sampled from 22 countries over a period of 76 years, was performed to determine the evolutionary history of this important reemerging pathogen. The analysis revealed that the currently circulating strains of YFV arose in Africa within the last 1,500 years and emerged in the Americas following the slave trade approximately 300-400 years ago. These viruses then spread westwards across the continent and persist there to this day in the jungles of South America. This study illustrates how gene sequence data can be used to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and documents the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease.
A study was conducted to analyze the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model, with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. The study aimed to identify vulnerable points in the multiple steps of pneumococcal pathogenesis by analyzing population bottlenecks in the model. The findings revealed that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. These observations demonstrate how viral infection and the TLR-dependent innate immune responses it stimulates and that are required to control it drive bacterial contagion. The pneumococcus has a predominantly commensal lifestyle and is a leading cause of disease, with high rates of carriage and complications such as otitis media, pneumonia, and sepsis. Pneumococcal infection has been partially controlled through immunization, with the most well-established effect of vaccine-induced immunity in adults being protection of the individual from pneumococcal bacteremia. More recently, widespread immunization of children has led to lower rates of transmission within the community and protection of unvaccinated populations (herd immunity). The study aimed to identify the steps during infection where pneumococci must pass through a population bottleneck, which would be attractive 'weak points' for intervention strategies since there would be relatively few organisms to target.
The article discusses a study conducted to identify and validate recombinant salivary proteins of Phlebotomus orientalis, an important vector of Leishmania donovani, as potential markers of exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from disease-endemic areas in Eastern Africa. The study aimed to screen human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. After producing recombinant proteins in bacterial and mammalian expression systems, the researchers identified two proteins, mAG5 and mYEL1, as the most promising antigens for detecting anti-P. orientalis antibodies. These two proteins showed a high correlation coefficient and good specificity compared to whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. The utilization of equal amounts of these two proteins significantly increased the capability to detect anti-P. orientalis antibody responses. The study highlights the potential of using recombinant salivary proteins as markers of exposure to sand fly bites and the importance of further studies in developing a reliable and efficient serological test for P. orientalis exposure.
IncC conjugative plasmids and Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) are frequently associated with multidrug resistance in clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. SGI1 is specifically mobilized in trans by IncA and IncC plasmids following its excision from the chromosome, an event triggered by the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD encoded by these helper plasmids. While SGI1 is not self-transmissible, it carries three genes (traNS, traHS, and traGS) coding for distant homologs of mating pore subunits TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC, respectively, encoded by A/C plasmids. AcaCD increases the expression of traNS and traHGS, and these genes are essential for IncC plasmid transfer. TraNS, TraHS, and TraGS are functional proteins that can replace TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC in the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids. Remodeling of the IncC-encoded mating pore by SGI1 is essential to enhance the transfer rate of SGI1 over the helper plasmid and allows DNA transfer between cells bearing IncC helper plasmids. Conjugation is a major mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, allowing the exchange of large numbers of genes per transfer event across taxonomical barriers. It is mediated by a complex nano-machine called the type IV secretion system (T4SS) and is often associated with the transfer of genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance, virulence determinants, and other advantageous traits for the bacterial host. IncC plasmids are often found in clinical isolates of major pathogenic bacteria and can transfer and replicate efficiently in a broad range of Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrio cholerae. They are closely related to IncA plasmids and share a common scaffold of genes necessary for their replication, stability, conjugative transfer, and regulation. Expression of the conjugative transfer genes of IncC plasmids is controlled by repressors Acr1 and Acr2, which control the transcription of an operon containing acaC and acaD that code for the two subunits of the master activator AcaCD. In IncC plasmids, AcaCD specifically binds to and activates 18 promoters that drive the expression of multiple genes and operons, most of which are of unknown function. A third of these promoters drive the expression of tra genes coding for F-type T4SS assembly, mating pair stabilization, and the relaxase and type IV coupling protein necessary for conjugative transfer. AcaCD also activates the expression of genes carried by unrelated mobilizable genomic islands (MGIs), thereby triggering their excision from the chromosome and their IncC-dependent dissemination into new bacterial hosts. SGI1 and its multiple variants are frequently found in S. enterica and Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates and all share a common 26-kb core region disrupted by a complex class 1 integron conferring multidrug resistance. SGI1 is thought to hijack the conjugative apparatus encoded by IncA and IncC plasmids to transfer to a new host cell by a mechanism that remains unknown as no origin of transfer (or oriT) or mobilization protein such as a relaxase has been identified in SGI1 to date. However, SGI1 has been reported to be mobilized at a much higher rate than MGIVmi1 and MGIVchHai6 (~3 logs higher) when mobilized by the same IncC plasmid, even outperforming the helper plasmid by 10 fold.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 promotes adaptation to the DNA damage checkpoint, which occurs when cells with persistent or irreparable DNA damage escape the cell-cycle arrest imposed by the DNA damage checkpoint. The study found that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad5
The brain's extracellular space (ECS) contains ion concentration changes that are crucial to understanding various pathological conditions such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression. Experimentally tracking ion concentrations and electric potential simultaneously in relevant brain regions is currently unfeasible, but computational models based on biophysical principles are a solution. Previous models were limited in exploring electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales due to high computing power requirements. This issue is addressed by a new 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework tailored for large scales and demonstrated through a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell simulation. The KNP-framework bypasses charge-relaxation processes on nanometer and nanosecond scales and is efficient for running simulations on millimeter and second scales on a standard desktop computer. This study highlights the potential of the 3-D KNP framework for understanding pathological conditions with substantial concentration variations in the ECS.
The proposed budget cut in the CDC's vector-borne diseases program, which could amount to $26.7 million, could have significant consequences for the country's ability to prevent and manage mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus. A study evaluating the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics found that halting mosquito surveillance could increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The study used a mathematical model to generate hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia, and estimated the cumulative costs of each response scenario. The results showed that even without considering the cost in human lives and well-being, the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens.The proposed budget cut could virtually paralyze surveillance and research activities directed at diseases already circulating in the US, such as dengue and West Nile virus, and jeopardize the capability of the existing health infrastructure for early detection of other exotic mosquito-transmitted pathogens such as Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, and chikungunya virus. Surveillance is the first line of defense against infectious diseases, and cuts to the CDC's vector-borne diseases program could have severe consequences for the country's ability to prevent and manage mosquito-borne diseases.The analysis clearly shows that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of the cost in human lives and well-being. The proposed budget cut could have significant consequences for the country's ability to prevent and manage mosquito-borne diseases. Therefore, the proposed budget cut should be re-assessed, and improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance are needed. The findings provide a science-based justification for the importance of the CDC's vector-borne diseases program.
Dengue is a significant and mostly unrecognized cause of fever in rural western Nicaragua, with 63.5% of febrile patients testing positive for dengue antibodies. The study found that 5.1% of patients had acute dengue, with only 8.1% of confirmed cases suspected clinically. The study also found that dengue seroprevalence increased with age, reaching over 90% in people over the age of 20. The population in the study is at risk for the Zika epidemic that has reached Central America, as Zika is transmitted by the same vector and has been associated with severe congenital infections. The study suggests that dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in rural western Nicaragua, and the population is at risk for Zika due to the same vector transmission. The study's limitations include the use of a convenience sample and the reliance on self-reported data. However, the study's strengths include prospective data collection and rigorous testing for dengue infection. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering dengue in the diagnosis of febrile illness in rural western Nicaragua and the need for ongoing surveillance for Zika in the region.
Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant losses to crops annually, with an estimated yield loss of 12% internationally and up to 30% in some crops like banana. Nematodes reproduce either parthenogenically or sexually, and the economically significant sedentary endoparasitic nematodes include root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and cyst nematodes (Globodera spp. and Heterodera spp.). These nematodes induce the formation of feeding sites in the roots of host plants, which serve as their sole source of nutrients. Plants have defense mechanisms against nematodes, including the perception of pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs) via surface-localised pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). However, nematodes can down-regulate or overcome these plant defense responses. In a study, it was shown that Arabidopsis elicits PTI-like responses upon nematode detection, as evidenced by the induction of genes previously shown to be induced during PTI. Additionally, NemaWater (water containing nematode-secreted molecules) from root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne incognita triggers a strong and consistent ROS burst in Arabidopsis roots. Furthermore, NemaWater contains potential elicitor/s that is/are recognized by an immune receptor in plants leading to the activation of PTI-like responses. Pre-treatment with NemaWater reduces the growth of virulent P. syringae and the number of nematodes in Arabidopsis plants, indicating the presence of putative elicitor(s) in NemaWater. These elicitors are likely to be of proteinaceous nature, as treatment of NemaWater with Proteinase K reduces its ability to induce ROS burst. BAK1, a co-receptor for LRR-RLKs and LRR-RLPs, acts as a co-receptor for nematode-derived elicitors. Mutants of bak1-5 and bak1-5 bkk1-1 are more susceptible to nematodes, indicating the importance of BAK1 in defense responses. A nematode-induced LRR-RLK, NILR1, was identified as a potential PRR involved in nematode perception and the induction of PTI responses. The nilr1 mutant showed a consistent increase in the number of female nematodes as compared with Col-0. Overall, the study highlights the potential of manipulating NILR1 and NemaWater for nematode control in crop plants in the future.
Miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, has been successfully repositioned for the treatment of Leishmania infections and shows promising effects against Schistosoma spp, targeting all life cycle stages of the parasite. A study examined the effect of miltefosine on Schistosoma mansoni adult worms and its exposure of worm surface antigens in vitro. In an indirect immunofluorescence assay, rabbit anti-S. mansoni adult worm homogenate and anti-S. mansoni infection antisera gave strong immunofluorescence of the S. mansoni adult worm surface after treatment with miltefosine. Rabbit antibodies that recognized surface antigens exposed on miltefosine-treated worms were recovered and used in a western immunoblotting assay to identify antigenic targets in a homogenate extract of adult worms. Four proteins reacting with the antibodies in immunoblots were purified and proteomic analysis indicated they were the S. mansoni proteins: fructose-1, 6 bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase and malate dehydrogenase. These antibodies were also found to bind to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induce immune agglutination of the parasites, suggesting they may have a role in immune protection. This study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent and the potential of these antigens as intervention targets. Despite extensive control efforts, schistosomiasis is still prevalent in many countries and concerns are growing over development of resistance to the only drug available for treatment, praziquantel. The suboptimal efficacy of PZQ against immature stages of the infection is another concern. Thus, the search for an alternative therapeutic control or a combination strategy that is effective against multiple stages of the schistosome life cycle has become necessary. One approach is to identify and develop alternative uses for existing, approved drugs that have had their pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and pre-clinical data evaluated - an approach known as ‘Drug-Repositioning’. Miltefosine is a promising example of this approach, with effectiveness against Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium in vitro and against different developmental stages of S. mansoni in vivo. The drug exhibited an advantage over PZQ by clearing the infection at the invasive, immature and adult parasite stages.
The host-pathogen struggle for iron in the infection process is crucial as iron is essential for many biological processes in most life forms, but its low solubility and bioavailability require bacteria to evolve multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources such as heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. While the molecular basis of iron acquisition from heme and hemoglobin has been extensively studied, little is known about iron acquisition from host ferritin, a 24-mer nanocage protein that stores thousands of iron atoms. However, recent studies have shown that the intracellular bacterium Neisseria meningitidis and the surface protein Als3 of Candida albicans can utilize ferritin for iron acquisition. In the human opportunistic pathogen Bacillus cereus, a surface protein named IlsA binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface, and binds several types of ferritins through direct interaction with the shell subunits. Disruption of the siderophore bacillibactin production drastically reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth, resulting in attenuated bacterial virulence in insects. Therefore, a new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus involves the binding of IlsA to host ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake, highlighting a possible interplay between a surface protein and a siderophore, and providing new insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and general bacterial pathogenesis.
The protein phosphorylation cycle in the cyanobacterium S. elongatus, consisting of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins, is a crucial part of its circadian clock. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two domains, CI and CII, which can bind and hydrolyze ATP but only CII can be phosphorylated at two residues. A new thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model has been presented, explaining how the clock is driven. The model suggests that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active conformational state and an inactive one. Phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. KaiA acts as a nucleotide exchange factor, stimulating phosphorylation of KaiC, and the differential affinity of KaiA for the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. The release of ADP from CI slows down as the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises, making the inactive conformational state of KaiC more stable and leading to KaiC dephosphorylation. The model can describe a wealth of experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a significant public health concern, causing about 600,000 deaths annually and affecting 350 million people chronically worldwide. HBV is a DNA virus but replicates through an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), which can be sensed by the RIG-I and activates MAVS to mediate interferon (IFN) λ synthesis. However, HBV has developed mechanisms to suppress IFN-αβ synthesis. A study has shown that HBV-induced parkin, a protein associated with Parkinson’s disease, recruits the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) to mitochondria and abrogates IFN-β synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, accumulates unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS via LUBAC, disrupts the MAVS signalosome, and attenuates IRF3 activation. This study highlights the novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling and provides avenues of investigations on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity. Mitochondria serve as a platform for innate immune signaling, and MAVS, a mitochondrial membrane protein, is the central adaptor molecule on which signals from various pattern recognition receptors that specifically recognize viral nucleic acids converge. HBV suppresses IFN-β synthesis both in vivo and in vitro cultured cells infection. The HBx, a regulatory protein encoded by HBV, targets MAVS-IRF3 signaling and inhibits IFN-β production. In HBV infection, the HBV expression rendered the cells less responsive to polyI:C (pI:C) as evidenced by reduced interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE) activity. However, Parkin silencing in these cells restored MAVS/IRF3 signaling, suggesting that HBV usurps Parkin’s function to abrogate antiviral signaling. HBx expression is required for the inhibition of ISRE activity. Parkin silencing in Huh7 cells transfected with wild-type HBV genome restored ISRE activity upon pI:C stimulation. Similarly, HBx expressing Huh7 cells showed reduced ISRE activity, however silencing Parkin expression was sufficient to restore ISRE activity in these cells. Altogether, these findings confirmed that the ability of HBV/HBx to regulate antiviral signaling is mediated by Parkin via enhanced mitochondrial recruitment. The Parkin and HBx interact with MAVS and likely be a part of the MAVS signalosome. HBV expression potentiates Parkin association with MAVS that could be instrumental in suppressing MAVS downstream signaling. Therefore, HBV expression abrogates MAVS-IRF3 signaling by mechanism independent of mitophagy. Parkin can enhance ubiquitin chains on MAVS but does not target MAVS for proteasomal degradation. In HBV expressing cells, the linear (or M-1 ) and K-63 linked chains attached to MAVS were predominantly unanchored in nature and accumulation of M-1 and K-63 linked ubiquitin chains on MAVS is Parkin-dependent. Parkin, being unable to catalyze the linear ubiquitination, can modulate linear ubiquitin chains on MVAS via LUBAC. The LUBAC remains a critical factor for inhibition of antiviral response. In HBV expressing cells, the Parkin mediated modulation of MAVS signaling is actually mediated via LUBAC activity. The Parkin interacts with LUBAC, and the enhanced interaction between Parkin and LUBAC in HBV replicating cells could modulate the stability of LUBAC subunits. In the HBV off condition, most of the HOIP signals were cytosolic, however, in the hepatocytes expressing HBV, there was an enhanced overlap of HOIP and MAVS signal which raised the possibility that upon HBV replication, LUBAC subunits are recruited to the mitochondria. Finally, the cells expressing HBV with silenced level of Parkin did not show any LUBAC accumulation on the mitochondria.
The protein I2, encoded by the pfiT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, is a T-cell superantigen associated with Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. I2/pfiT is a member of the TetR-family of DNA-binding transcription regulators and belongs to a new family of T cell superantigens. It directly interacts with HLA-DR and competes with other superantigens for binding to HLA-DR, indicating that their binding sites overlap. I2/pfiT has been found to stimulate the proliferation of human lymphocytes and bind to mammalian cells in a class II MHC-specific manner. The structural analyses revealed that I2/pfiT and its homolog PA2885 bind to human class II MHC HLA-DR, and to a lesser extent HLA-DP or HLA-DQ, and share an overlapping binding site on HLA-DR1 with other superantigens. The I2 sequence was selectively detected in active CD lesional colonic tissue and serum antibody studies revealed that IgA seroreactivity to a recombinant I2 protein was CD specific. The I2 protein induces proliferation and IL-10 responses by normal CD4+ T cells and its response is dependent on MHC class II-mediated recognition, a feature typical of SAgs. The I2 response was specific for the murine TCR-Vβ5 subpopulation and pfiT exhibited T-cell SAg bioactivity. PA2885, the apparent Pseudomonas aeruginosa homolog of pfiT, also stimulated murine CD4+ T cell proliferation. Therefore, it is speculated that the I2 protein pfiT is a novel T-cell SAg and colonization by the I2 and pfiT-expressing microorganism, P. fluorescens, in IBD susceptible hosts, could provide a superantigenic stimulus pertinent to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
Nanog is a critical regulator of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency. Recent findings reveal that Nanog exhibits a disperse distribution within stem cell populations due to allelic control of Nanog gene expression and gene expression noise. A multiscale stochastic population balance equation (PBE) framework was developed to investigate how allelic control of Nanog expression influences stem cell population heterogeneity. This framework considers allelic control, gene expression noise, and random partitioning at cell division. The results indicate that allelic control and gene expression noise generate a bimodal distribution of Nanog, while initially uniform populations of stem cells give rise to the same Nanog heterogeneity within ten cell cycles. Allelic regulation facilitates the maintenance of fractions of self-renewing cells with sufficient Nanog content, preventing aberrant loss of pluripotency. The model findings highlight the role of allelic control of Nanog expression as a prime determinant of stem cell population heterogeneity and warrant further investigation in the contexts of stem cell specification and cell reprogramming. This research has important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms governing Nanog heterogeneity and its impact on stem cell fate decisions, and highlights the need for reexamining current rationales proposed for the variability of Nanog in stem cell ensembles.
The cost and benefit of protein expression are balanced through evolution. The expression of unutilized protein, which has no benefits in the current environment, incurs quantifiable fitness costs on cellular growth rates. However, the magnitude and variability of unutilized protein expression in natural settings are unknown due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome utilization. A recent study combined absolute and global proteomics data with a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli to compute the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis. The results showed that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments, and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains over 95% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across 16 distinct environments. Furthermore, reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. The unused protein encodes several nutrient- and stress-preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Thus, unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change. Overall, the costs and benefits of protein synthesis on organismal fitness shape the evolution and regulation of proteome expression.
Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic variants associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D), many of which are in proteins not previously suspected to be involved in T2D pathogenesis. However, most GWAS have focused on populations of European descent, and GWAS conducted in other populations offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of T2D. A study was conducted to perform genome-wide association scans for T2D in Chinese, Malays, and Asian Indians, with the goal of identifying novel variants implicated in T2D and assessing the transferability and relevance of previous findings from European populations in the three major ethnic populations of Asia, comprising half of the world's population. The study found that of the SNPs associated with T2D in previous GWAS, only variants at CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 showed the strongest association with T2D in the meta-analysis including all three ethnic groups. However, consistent direction of effect was observed for many of the other SNPs in the study and in those carried out in European populations. The findings highlight the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups towards the fine-mapping efforts for the casual variants and also of the search for variants, which may be population-specific. The study underscores the need for further research to fully understand the genetic architecture of T2D in diverse populations.
The nuclear division in the budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, a basidiomycete fungus, differs from that of ascomycete budding yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In C. neoformans, the nuclear envelope transiently ruptures during mitosis, allowing the evolutionarily conserved Aurora B kinase Ipl1 to localize to the nucleus and ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Ipl1 is required for the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope, and its spatio-temporal regulation influences Bim1 or/and dynein activity along with microtubule stability to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. Ipl1 ensures the integrity and timely disassembly of the mitotic spindle and phosphorylates She1 and Bim1, influencing dynein activity along the cMTs and spindle movement. C. neoformans divides by budding, and its microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), microtubule fibers, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and molecular motors regulate microtubule dynamics and the mitotic spindle's functioning. The cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) ensure proper spindle positioning and nuclear migration. The Aurora B kinase Ipl1 primarily senses the tension at the kinetochore, stabilizing bi-oriented kinetochore-MT attachments and destabilizing incorrect kinetochore-MT attachments. In C. neoformans, Ipl1 is essential for viability and plays a crucial role in maintaining ploidy during mitosis.
A study published in the journal Nature Genetics in 2017 investigated a case of an aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) that harbored a somatic RET p. Cys634Arg mutation, a known MTC driver. The researchers also found a germ-line RET substitution (p. Cys630=), which had been considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. However, further investigation revealed that the synonymous mutation was in cis with the somatic RET p. Cys634Arg driver mutation and was sufficient to explain the increased RET mRNA level. The presence of the synonymous substitution created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs that enhanced SRp55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of its pre-mRNA and an increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression. This study highlights the importance of considering synonymous mutations in cancer research, as they can have functional relevance and play driver roles in human cancer.
"Metagenomic sequencing of patient samples has the potential to be a highly effective method for diagnosing human infections, as it can capture and analyze all DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a sample. However, the accuracy of this method depends on the quality and availability of genomes for comparison. While thousands of genomes are now available and this number is growing, the presence of contamination in published genomes poses a risk for falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this issue, a new bioinformatics system has been developed to eliminate contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This has resulted in a database of ""clean"" eukaryotic pathogen genomes, which has been shown to provide better sensitivity and a significant reduction in false positives when used for diagnosis.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a valuable tool for human pathogen discovery and diagnosis. It provides a fast, specific, and relatively unbiased method of capturing the full spectrum of macro- and microorganisms in any sample. NGS has been shown to be particularly useful in cases where traditional histological, immunological, or molecular techniques are limited or yield incorrect or incomplete diagnoses. For example, NGS has been used to identify bacterial infections in fecal specimens, confirm cultured bacterial infections in urine samples, identify polymicrobial bacterial infections by directly sequencing urine samples, and diagnose bacterial infections in cerebrospinal fluid.Despite the growing number of sequenced pathogens, the dependence on reference databases for diagnosis still presents challenges. This is due to the fact that no database contains the full spectrum of all potential human pathogens and existing reference databases have been found to contain contamination. Additionally, microbial genome projects have predominantly focused on bacteria and viruses, with genome entries in databases such as GenBank and RefSeq reflecting this focus. This means that eukaryotic pathogens, which are critically important for the diagnosis of human infections, are underrepresented in genomic databases.EuPathDB is a database representing more than 250 eukaryotic microorganisms, including both known pathogens and other closely related non-infectious eukaryotic species. However, because no eukaryotic pathogen has yet been completely sequenced, this resource comprises primarily draft genomes at varying degrees of completeness. Despite this, EuPathDB is more comprehensive than the RefSeq database, containing more than 150 genomes that are absent from the RefSeq protozoa and fungi databases.Contamination and incompleteness in reference databases can cause bioinformatics analysis of sequencing reads to yield both false positive and false negative results, decreasing the overall reliability of NGS in pathogen diagnostics. To address this issue, a new method for eliminating genomic contamination has been developed, yielding a cleaned and filtered eukaryotic pathogen database for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those intended for NGS diagnostics, with decreased false positive and false negative rates."
Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a major health problem in Uganda, caused by the unicellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which has three subspecies: T. b. brucei (Tbb), T. b. gambiense (Tbg), and T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr). Tbr and Tbg cause the acute and chronic forms of HAT, respectively. Tbr is restricted to certain regions of East Africa, while Tbg is more widespread in West and Central Africa. Both Tbr and Tbb can co-occur in the same non-human hosts as well as in the tsetse vector. However, recombination is known to happen only in the salivary glands of the tsetse. Tbr is not a reproductively isolated taxon but regarded as a host-range variant of Tbb. A single gene encoding the Serum Resistance Associated (SRA) protein allows Tbr to survive in humans. This gene possesses two main alleles across the Tbr distribution and could potentially be spread naturally by genetic exchange between Tbr and Tbb. Uganda is currently the only country in sub-Saharan Africa known to harbor all three subspecies of T. brucei. The locations of districts affected by HAT are shown in Fig . 1. During most of the 20th century, Tbr was limited to south-east Uganda in the old foci of Busoga (BS) and Bugiri (BG), and in areas bordering Tanzania and Kenya, such as Busia (BU). By the late 1980’s HAT appeared in Tororo (TR) and by 1998, HAT cases began to spread north and west being recorded in the Soroti (SR) district. From 2004 to date, all the districts in central Uganda-Kaberamaido (KA), Dokolo (DK), Lira (LR), Apac (AP), Kole (KO) —have reported HAT cases. The affected areas increased in size from 13, 820 to 34, 843 km2, doubling the human population at risk. Tbr and Tbg are now less than 120km apart. The epidemics in the new foci have been attributed to import of cattle carrying Tbr from disease endemic areas in the south. Analyses of microsatellite and mitochondrial haplotype data show that the populations of G. f. fuscipes north and south of Lake Kyoga are genetically distinct and have identified long distance dispersal events. Population genetics studies have been carried out on T. brucei isolates across Africa, including HAT foci in Uganda and western Kenya. Analysis of Tbr isolates from the old foci in southeastern Uganda (BS, BG, BU) by isoenzyme, RFLP, and microsatellite analyses show that they are relatively heterogeneous. Genotype has been correlated with clinical presentation in patients and virulence in experimental mice. Microsatellite analysis (7 loci) of Tbr populations from Tororo/Soroti and Malawi showed that levels of genetic diversity were much higher in the Malawi focus, with evidence of recent genetic exchange between isolates. The lack of genetic exchange and clonal, epidemic population structure of Tororo/Soroti Tbr agrees with the conclusions of previous population genetics studies. Thus, the local population structure of Tbr seems to depend on the relative amounts of clonal versus sexual reproduction, driven by transmission dynamics specific to the local conditions. A comprehensive study of genetic variation in Ugandan T. brucei was conducted using a set of 17 highly variable microsatellite loci to investigate the patterns of genetic variation among 269 Tbb and Tbr isolates from Uganda and the neighbouring region of western Kenya in order to understand the extent of genetic exchange both within and between Tbb and Tbr and to investigate the origin and spread of HAT in Uganda. Understanding the population structure of T. brucei and the extent of genetic variation in both human infective and non-infective subspecies will reveal the potential for generation and spread of new human infective strains and is thus of critical relevance for disease control.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is a gene originally identified in HL-60 cells that is upregulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and negatively regulates the function and expression of thioredoxin. It is a member of the arrestin protein family and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the response to oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Additionally, its expression is reduced in various types of tumors, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. In this report, the authors investigate the role of TXNIP in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock and the inflammatory process. They found that TXNIP plays a crucial role in regulating the sensitivity of mice to lethal endotoxin-induced shock. Specifically, Txnip−/− mice were more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxic shock, as evidenced by their decreased survival rate, lower blood glucose levels, and lower body temperature after LPS injection compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, the lungs of LPS-treated Txnip−/− mice showed more intense immune cell infiltration, and the spleens from LPS-treated Txnip−/− mice were significantly larger than those of WT mice. These findings suggest that TXNIP plays an essential role in regulating sensitivity to lethal endotoxin-induced shock. However, the increased susceptibility of Txnip−/− mice to endotoxic shock was not due to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Instead, it was due to increased nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in Txnip−/− macrophages. Specifically, Txnip−/− macrophages produced significantly higher levels of NO and iNOS than WT macrophages after LPS or E. coli stimulation. These findings suggest that TXNIP is a crucial constituent of the inflammatory response through the regulation of NO production via the NF-κB/iNOS pathway. Therefore, TXNIP plays a critical role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during endotoxic shock. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of TXNIP in regulating the inflammatory response and its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.
ZTF-8 is a protein conserved from worms to humans that plays a crucial role in repairing both mitotic and meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) and in activating the meiotic DNA damage checkpoint in the C. elegans germline. It localizes to both chromatin and the nucleolus, and its subcellular localization changes in response to DNA damage. ZTF-8 interacts with MRT-2, a member of the 9-1-1 DNA damage response (DDR) complex, and the human RHINO protein can rescue the phenotypes observed in ztf-8 mutants, suggesting functional conservation across species. ZTF-8 promotes repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic DSBs, and its functions are required for genomic stability in the germline. Defects in DNA repair genes, including those involved in DSB repair, are linked to tumor progression and cancer. For example, germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD50, NBS1, and Fanconi anemia FA genes have been linked to breast, ovarian, skin cancer, leukemia, and lymphomas. Understanding DSBR at a molecular and cellular level in a genetically tractable multicellular system like C. elegans is of great importance for understanding the role of DNA repair genes in tumor progression.
In tissue development, multipotent progenitors differentiate into specific cell types in characteristic spatial and temporal patterns. A study focusing on the neural tube found that motor neuron (MN) progenitors differentiate more rapidly than other progenitors. Utilizing single-cell transcriptomics, the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs were defined. The findings revealed a pivotal role for the MN determinant Olig2 just prior to MN differentiation, where it represses the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5. Olig2 repression of Hes5 appears to be direct, via a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus, restricting expression from MN progenitors. These results demonstrate how Olig2 acts as the developmental pacemaker, coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation, and showcasing the tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation.
"A study using rhesus macaques as a model for human influenza infection aimed to examine the role of T cells in cross-protection against different influenza viruses. Five macaques were inoculated with a seasonal H1N1 isolate, and four months later, they and seven naive controls were challenged with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm). The results showed that T cells play a crucial role in the early clearance of H1N1pdm infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tract in ""primed"" animals, i.e., those previously infected with the seasonal H1N1 isolate. The ""primed"" animals cleared the infection significantly earlier than the naive animals, and before the appearance of H1N1pdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. This study suggests that vaccines capable of inducing cross-reactive T cells may help protect against severe disease caused by newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses. The emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus raised fears of a new and severe pandemic, and it was determined that its hemagglutinin (HA) envelope protein was derived from the ""classical swine"" lineage, descended from the H1N1 virus that emerged in 1918. Few individuals under age 65 had antibodies capable of recognizing the emerging virus, and by June 2009, the World Health Organization had declared the first influenza pandemic of the 21st Century. The study of T cells in human immunity to influenza remains unclear, but there is evidence that T cells play a role in promoting viral clearance and reducing influenza disease severity. In mice, CD8+ T cells primed by influenza viruses of one subtype can mediate ""heterosubtypic immunity"" against challenge with serologically distinct viruses in the absence of cross-reactive antibody. A recent study in ferrets suggested that previous infection with seasonal influenza viruses reduced shedding of H1N1pdm. Similar serial infection studies in mice suggest that cross-reactive T cells raised by infection with seasonal influenza strains can protect against lethal challenge with H1N1pdm, while antibodies cannot. A retrospective epidemiological study suggested that cellular immune responses induced by recent infection might have protected individuals from severe disease in the 1957 pandemic. Despite these findings, there is little direct evidence from humans that T cells mediate protection from influenza disease or enable rapid virus clearance. Therefore, a translational model of immunity to influenza using rhesus macaques was developed, as they share a closer phylogenetic relationship with humans than mice or ferrets do. One study of DNA-based vaccines in macaques suggested that T cells alone might be capable of limiting replication of H5N1 viruses and protecting vaccinated animals against severe disease. The present study found that T cells ""primed"" by infection with a seasonal human influenza virus were elicited and may serve to limit virus replication after challenge with a heterologous 2009 pandemic isolate. The study suggests that vaccines capable of stimulating T cell responses could play an important role in mitigating the severity of future influenza pandemics, when pre-existing antibodies are not likely to be effective."
Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a widespread zoonosis that can be transmitted to humans through aerosol inhalation or under-processed milk products. Domestic and livestock animals are the most common sources of transmission. The disease is difficult to distinguish from other febrile diseases in humans due to a lack of specific clinical manifestations. In animals, C. burnetii infection is often misdiagnosed due to the lack of identifiable features. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from both the acute and convalescent stages of infection, which are unavailable for early diagnosis. To address these challenges, a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to rapidly and sensitively identify C. burnetii. The LAMP assay has a limit of detection of 1 copy per reaction and a specificity of 100%, with no cross-reaction observed among the bacteria used in the study. The positive rate of unknown febrile patients was 33.3% (95%CI 30.2%--36.4%) for the LAMP assay and 8.3% (95%CI 7.4%--9.2%) for the real time PCR (P<0.05). Similarly, the total positive rate of animals was 7.9% (95%CI 7.1%--8.7%) for the LAMP assay and 0.8% (95%CI 0.7%--0.9%) for the real time PCR (P<0.01). The LAMP assay is a potential tool to support the diagnosis of Q fever in humans and domestic animals, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without the aid of sophisticated equipment or a complicated protocol.
Certain cancers exhibit gene expression profiles similar to undifferentiated cells, resembling embryonic stem cells, but the mechanisms controlling these expression programs are unclear. A novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations, called ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs), was discovered through exploration of transcriptional enhancers during hematopoietic cell development and derived cancers. These ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, with methylated ESSEs being hypermethylated in cancer and co-localized with silenced genes, while unmethylated ESSEs tend to be hypomethylated in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. The disruption of normal cellular identity is a hallmark of cancer cells, and this study suggests that the discovered enhancer sites may provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer. DNA methylation is closely linked to enhancer activity states and to expression levels of associated cancer genes, and the DNA methylation level is an essential factor in enhancer reprograming in cancer. Enhancers present in ES cells and absent from differentiated hematopoietic cells are especially prone to DNA methylation alterations in cancer, providing a basis for the reactivation of ES genes in cancer.
The article discusses the role of population subdivision in crossing fitness valleys or plateaus in a rugged fitness landscape, which is a common feature in genotype space due to epistasis. The study uses a simple and minimal model of subdivision with migration, without any dependence on the average fitness of a deme or additional effects such as extinction and re-founding of demes. The model consists of an ensemble of identical demes, each with a constant number of individuals, and treats migration as a random exchange of individuals between two different demes. The focus is on the simplest fitness valley or plateau involving three successive genotypes, and the study determines the optimal time it takes for the whole metapopulation to cross the fitness valley or plateau, i.e., to fix mutation ‘2’ in all demes, starting from an initial state where all individuals have genotype ‘0’.The study finds that subdivision can significantly accelerate fitness valley or plateau crossing over a wide range of parameters, both with respect to a non-subdivided population and with respect to a single deme. The results show that the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing by subdivision can be realized when isolated demes are in the sequential fixation regime, and that this effect can be observed even when the non-subdivided population is in the tunneling regime. The study also highlights the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs, and discusses the magnitude and robustness of the effect for realistic parameter values.In summary, the study provides quantitative insights into the conditions under which population subdivision can accelerate fitness valley or plateau crossing in a rugged fitness landscape, which is a common feature in genotype space due to epistasis. The results show that subdivision can significantly accelerate fitness valley or plateau crossing over a wide range of parameters, and that the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing by subdivision can be realized when isolated demes are in the sequential fixation regime. The study also highlights the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs, and discusses the magnitude and robustness of the effect for realistic parameter values. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of population subdivision in evolution and adaptation.
The article describes the first comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector for various arboviruses including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. The study used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the temporal metabolic perturbations that occur following dengue virus infection of the midgut tissue, the primary site of infection and replication before systemic dissemination and transmission. The results showed a dynamic-profile of metabolites, particularly a marked increase in the lipid content, with elevation of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acyls coincident with the kinetics of viral replication. The study also identified a critical hub in the sphingolipid pathway that influenced dihydroceramide to ceramide ratios as a vital factor for the virus life cycle, resulting in the first reconstruction of the sphingolipid pathway in Aedes aegypti. The conservation of replication mechanisms of several flaviviruses transmitted by this vector suggests that these biochemical choke points could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes. The study is crucial for developing novel transmission-blocking interventions for controlling globally important diseases.
"The article discusses the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind fatal cardiac arrhythmias through the integration of electrophysiological experiments, models, and theory. Existing models of transmembrane action potential (AP) are complex, varying, and often based on outdated data, leading to the need for simpler models that can clarify the minimum physiological requirements for significant observable phenomena. The authors developed a ""parsimonious"" rabbit AP model using a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of INa and a phenomenological model of repolarization. The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit myocytes under physiological conditions and was able to reproduce important emergent phenomena such as cellular alternans and spiral wave breakup. Model variants were studied to determine the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave break up, and the simplicity and physiological relevance of the model make it a solid building-block for generating more detailed ionic models. The article also discusses the limitations of existing ionic models, including over-parametrization, non-uniqueness, dissimilar predictions, and difficulty in representing natural redundancy, and compares these models to phenomenological models that are designed to represent specific phenomena but do not provide a direct link to physiologically meaningful model parameters. The most important membrane currents for cardiac excitability are INa and IK1, and transfecting cells with genes encoding for these currents and gap junctions can transform monolayers into excitable tissue. The isolated rabbit heart is a valuable model for studying human electrophysiology due to its similarities to human physiology, and the authors aim to develop a parsimonious model for the rabbit myocyte AP based on data recorded from the rabbit under physiological conditions."
"During the sexual cycle of the ciliate Paramecium, the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding germline sequences (IESs) takes place, resulting in the assembly of the somatic genome. These genome rearrangements are initiated by developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which depend on the domesticated transposase PiggyMac. Ligase IV and Xrcc4p, core components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ), are required for the repair of IES excision sites and for the circularization of excised IESs. A ""cut-and-close"" mechanism is used for IES excision, which involves the introduction of initiating double-strand cleavages at both ends of each IES, followed by DSB repair via highly precise end joining. This work provides new insights into how the cellular NHEJ pathway has cooperated with domesticated transposases for the emergence of new mechanisms involved in genome dynamics."
The study examines the mode of death of patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease compared to non-Chagas cardiomyopathy, using patients from the REMADHE trial. The study found that the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. Chagas etiology, left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), creatinine clearance, and use of amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure mortality. LVEDD and use of beta-blocker were independently associated with sudden death mortality. The study challenges the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications in the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death. The management of Chagas heart disease is complex, and the precise understanding of the current natural history of patients presenting systolic dysfunction is indispensable to plan adequate health politics and improve survival. The study population was from a single center, and the Chagas group was smaller than the non-Chagas group, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Clinicians should keep in mind that in severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure plays an important role as the most important mode of death in a scenario of worse prognosis in comparison with other etiologies. The data from this analysis challenges the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications in the selection of treatment choices considering the mode of death. The amiodarone role in chagasic heart disease should be reevaluated. Prevention of thromboembolism must be emphatically pursued. Finally, priority should be given to enhance the research related to prevent and treat the progression of heart failure in Chagas disease.
The NSP-interacting kinase (NIK) receptor-mediated defense pathway has been identified as a target of the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP), but the molecular mechanism through which this antiviral response is activated is unclear. A ribosomal protein, rpL10A, has been identified as a specific partner and substrate of NIK1 that functions as an immediate downstream effector of NIK1-mediated response. Phosphorylation of cytosolic rpL10A by NIK1 redirects the protein to the nucleus where it may act to modulate viral infection. Loss of rpL10A function enhances susceptibility to geminivirus infection, and geminivirus infection interferes with NIK1-mediated nuclear relocalization of rpL10A as a counterdefensive measure. NIK1-mediated defense signaling inhibits plant growth and development and may be involved in restricting the host range of other viruses. This highlights the complex relationships between viruses and their biological hosts, as viruses make extensive use of the basic host cellular machinery and have developed strategies to overcome host detection and interdiction systems. In plants, the major antiviral strategies are the hypersensitive response mediated by resistance genes and post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNA interference. The identification of host functions subverted by viral proteins has uncovered novel components from distinct layers of innate host defenses, including adenosine kinase and sucrose non-fermenting1 which mediate metabolic defenses possibly linked to gene silencing mechanisms. Additionally, a novel defense signaling pathway has been identified as a virulence target of the bipartite geminivirus NSP. Bipartite geminiviruses, such as begomoviruses, enhance their pathogenicity by suppressing the kinase activity of the transmembrane receptor-like kinase NIK through NSP-specific binding to the kinase domain.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungus that can cause paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), and its survival inside the host depends on its ability to adapt to different conditions, including oxidative stress imposed by immune cells. A recent study investigated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX), an enzyme involved in intracellular redox balancing, in the interaction between P. brasiliensis and host cells. The study generated a mitotically stable P. brasiliensis AOX (PbAOX) antisense RNA (aRNA) strain with a 70% reduction in gene expression. They evaluated the relevance of PbAOX during interaction of conidia and yeast cells with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. They found that PbAOX-aRNA conidia and yeast cells had decreased viability after interaction with macrophages, and in a mouse model of infection, the absence of wild-type levels of PbAOX in P. brasiliensis resulted in a reduced fungal burden in lungs at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and an increased survival rate. These data suggest that PbAOX is important in the fungal defense against oxidative stress imposed by immune cells and is relevant in the virulence of P. brasiliensis. Furthermore, the presence of H2O2 increased PbWt yeast cells' PbAOX expression and presented a higher viability in comparison with PbAOX-aRNA yeast cells, indicating that AOX plays a crucial role in the fungal defense against oxidative stress. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the role of AOX in the virulence of P. brasiliensis and its defense mechanism against oxidative stress imposed by the host during infection.
The rodent hippocampus forms a neural representation of the local environment using a dual rate and position code. Each pyramidal neuron is active when an animal is located within a distinct location in space, and its mean firing rate within this location varies with contextual features. These two coding schemes can be distinguished by observing how the network 'remaps' in response to changes in the local environment. Exposing the animal to a physically different space induces global remapping, in which both location and firing rate of place cells take entirely new values, while manipulating contextual features like the color or shape of surrounding walls, odors, or tasks within the same space can elicit substantial changes in firing rates while the location of place fields is unaffected. This is referred to as rate remapping and appears to reflect the presence of multiple context-dependent memories stored within a single spatial map.Recent experiments have observed a gradual transition in the population activity of CA3 place cells as a familiar square arena was morphed into a familiar circular arena in six steps following training in a rate remapping paradigm. These results imply that place cell firing rates are not dictated by network-wide attractor dynamics of the Hopfield type. Instead, both gradual and abrupt transitions were observed on the single neuron level, and in CA3 the transition points of single neuron firing rates also depended on the direction of morphing, a form of hysteresis characteristic of nonlinear systems. A network model of the CA3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts was developed to understand whether these seemingly conflicting results are commensurate with attractor network theory. The model found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and smooth transition curves arose from averaging across the population. Individual unit level responses, however, showed a heterogeneous set of responses. Orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels as experimentally observed when remapping between two independent spatial maps. Strong recurrent feedback entailed a hysteretic effect on the network which diminished with the amount of overlap in the stored memories. These results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells. Similar mechanisms for context-dependent memory may also be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex.
The microaerophilic enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica lacks key components of canonical eukaryotic anti-oxidative defense systems, and alternative anti-oxidative defense strategies have been postulated. This study investigated global metabolic responses in E. histolytica in response to H2O2- and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress using capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Oxidative stress caused drastic modulation of metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Oxidative stress resulted in the inhibition of glycolysis due to the inactivation of several key enzymes, leading to the redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. The levels of nucleoside triphosphates were decreased due to the repression of glycolysis as evidenced by the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates upstream of pyruvate and reduced ethanol production. This study also showed for the first time the presence of a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica as demonstrated by the increased production of glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol upon oxidative stress, suggesting its significance as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E. histolytica.
IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression pattern is required for proper hematopoiesis. It promotes gene repression and activation in collaboration with the NuRD complex and binds to the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) at gene promoters. IKAROS recruits the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to specific genes, influencing the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitating transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1α), an IKAROS-binding protein and P-TEFb activator, to CDK9. An IKAROS mutant unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impedes normal differentiation of IkNULL hematopoietic progenitors. The tumor suppressor IKAROS is involved in transcriptional regulation of erythroid- and myeloid-specific genes and its expression level influences the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. IKAROS controls chromatin organization mainly through association with the NuRD complex, which was initially identified as a repressive complex but demonstrates transcription activation capabilities. IKAROS interacts with CDK9, the catalytic subunit of P-TEFb, playing a role in the assembly and stability of the pre-initiation complex at promoters, promoting transcription elongation. CDK9 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA Polymerase II, allowing productive transcription elongation. The activation of CDK9/P-TEFb and transcription elongation is facilitated by the IKAROS-mediated recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex.
Bat rabies is an emerging public health issue in the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean island of Trinidad which experiences periodic outbreaks within its livestock population. A study was conducted to determine if these outbreaks are a result of in situ evolution or importation of the virus from the nearby South American mainland. The study found that Trinidadian rabies virus (RABV) sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) related sequences, falling into two main lineages (Trinidad I and II) that correlated with geographical and temporal distribution. Trinidad I, predominantly from the northeast of the island, was most closely related to RABV from Ecuador, Venezuela, and French Guiana. Trinidad II, from the southwest, clustered into two groups (Trinidad IIa and IIb) and was most closely related to sequences from Brazil and Uruguay. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis supported three separate RABV introductions from the mainland for each of the three Trinidadian lineages. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. These findings indicate co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa during 2000 and highlight the need for further studies on the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, particularly any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.
The cerebral cortex is divided into functionally distinct areas, and the emergence of these areas is dependent on the expression patterns of several genes. A study used a computational model to determine the regulatory interactions between five genes (Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8) that play a particularly strong role in specifying areal identity along the anterior-posterior axis. The model found that only a fraction of all possible networks were able to reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns, and these networks lacked certain interactions and combinations of interactions including auto-regulation and inductive loops. The analysis of the probability of each interaction indicated that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones. The model provides insights into the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of gene regulatory networks and the importance of computational modeling in understanding their behavior.
The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins control organism development by regulating the expression of developmental genes through transcriptional regulation, achieved in part by PRC2-mediated methylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) and PRC1-mediated ubiquitylation on lysine 119 of histone H2A (uH2A). Bmi1, an integral component of PRC1, is critical for H2A ubiquitylation. While genome-wide binding patterns of some PRC1 and PRC2 components, as well as the H3K27me3 mark, have been reported, there has been no report on uH2A genome-wide localization. Using ChIP-Seq, this study reports the genome-wide localization of the Bmi1-dependent uH2A mark in MEF cells, with a peak at promoters containing the H3K27me3 mark and representing the least expressed genes. Local enrichment of uH2A is linked to DNA methylation at high-density CpG promoters. These findings not only reveal Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation but also suggest that uH2A targeting in differentiated cells may employ a different mechanism from that in ES cells.
Pregnancy-Induced NonCoding RNA (PINC) and retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 (RbAp46) are upregulated in the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in alveolar cells that remain in the regressed lobules following involution, possibly functioning as alveolar progenitor cells. In post-pubertal mice, mPINC is enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitors, with levels increasing throughout pregnancy and declining in early lactation when alveolar cells undergo terminal differentiation. Overexpression of mPINC blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown enhances differentiation, suggesting that mPINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy to prevent abundant milk production and secretion until parturition. Additionally, a PRC2 complex that includes mPINC and RbAp46 may confer epigenetic modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland. mPINC is mammalian-specific, highly expressed in the mammary gland, and upregulated during pregnancy, specifically increasing in luminal cells and enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitors. mPINC may play a functional role in regulating hormonally-induced lactogenic differentiation, and mPINC downregulation may be required for terminal differentiation of alveolar cells in early lactation. The conserved regions of mPINC are necessary for its function as an inhibitor of lactogenic differentiation.
PML, also known as TRIM19, is a protein that primarily expresses in the nucleus and forms dynamic structures called PML nuclear bodies. It has been established that PML plays a crucial role in antiviral defense, but its impact on HIV-1 infection is unclear. Recent studies have shown that infection by HIV-1 and other retroviruses triggers the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies, interfering with an early step of retroviral infection by stabilizing Daxx, a partner of PML nuclear body-associated protein. Daxx, in the presence of PML, is found in the vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse-transcription, thus identifying Daxx as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription. PML and Daxx are part of the intrinsic immunity that constitutes the first line of defense against viral infection, and many viruses have developed strategies to counteract PML NB repression by disrupting PML NBs and/or inducing PML degradation. In summary, the findings reveal a novel antiviral function for PML and PML nuclear body-associated protein Daxx, identifying Daxx as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription, and providing new insight into its involvement in retroviral restriction.
Matt is a program that performs multiple protein structure alignment using an aligned fragment pair chaining algorithm with flexibility. It allows small translations and rotations between sets of aligned fragments in intermediate steps to better model protein structures, particularly in different conformational states or with backbone distortions. Matt has been shown to outperform other programs in aligning the ends of α-helices and β-strands, and to distinguish distantly homologous structure pairs from non-homologous ones using a p-value score based on the length of the common core and average RMSD. It is designed to handle structural distortions and conformational changes in proteins, and shows strong performance on the Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets.
Mitosis, a critical phase of the cell cycle, is characterized by the phosphorylation of over a thousand proteins by Cdk1 and other mitotic kinases. Upon exiting mitosis, these post-translational modifications must be removed by phosphatases. The regulation of mitotic kinases and phosphatases is complex, with mitotic kinase activity appearing to be inversely regulated by phosphatases to avoid futile cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Cdk1, a key player in mitosis, is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Thr14/Tyr15 by Wee1 and Myt1 kinases and positively regulated by the Cdc25 phosphatase. Greatwall kinase (Gwl) plays a crucial role in the G2/M transition by phosphorylating and activating the PP2A/B55δ inhibitors Endosulfin (Ensa) and ARPP19, which in turn inactivate PP2A/B55δ, a phosphatase that negatively regulates Cdk1. Gwl is itself regulated by phosphorylation and its phosphatases and the dynamics of this regulation are not well understood. A recent study used mathematical modeling and experiments with phospho-specific antibodies to monitor the phosphorylation of Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrates during mitotic entry and exit. The study found that PP2A/B55 is required for Gwl dephosphorylation at the essential Cdk site Thr194 and that Ensa/ARPP19 dephosphorylation is mediated by the RNA Polymerase II carboxy terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of neither Fcp1 nor PP2A appears to block dephosphorylation of the bulk of mitotic Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit, suggesting a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19 and Cdk substrate dephosphorylation during mitotic exit.
The aim of developing an HIV vaccine is to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Nab) that can limit the replication of genetically diverse viruses and prevent the establishment of a new infection. A detailed analysis of Nab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection showed that viral escape occurred despite the development of high titer autologous Nab. The escape was driven by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain (V3V5) and V1V2. A single mutational pathway was not sufficient to confer escape, and multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, were used to evade neutralization. HIV-1 undergoes recurrent cycles of escape from autologous Nab, and shifting carbohydrate moieties in and around the outer surface of gp120, changes in the hyper-variable domains, and emergence of N- and O-linked carbohydrates in the V1 and V4 hyper-variable domains have been proposed as general mechanisms used by HIV-1 and SHIV to alter neutralization epitopes. These studies highlight the complexity of HIV-1 neutralization and escape, and demonstrate that the flexibility of Env facilitates the use of multiple mechanisms.
In a study of the plant Capsella grandiflora, the genomes of 13 individuals were sequenced and the amount of selection across the genome was quantified. The results showed that selection is strong in coding regions but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). However, estimates of selection on noncoding regions conserved across the Brassicaceae family showed strong signals of selection. Reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions indicated recent selective sweeps at these sites. The study also found that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, the results suggest that both positive and negative selection on plant noncoding sequence are considerably rarer than in animal genomes, but widespread positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions was observed.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a human tumor virus associated with various malignancies, including Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV can efficiently immortalize naïve B-lymphocytes and establish long-term latent infection in these immortalized cells. EBV drives B-cell proliferation and differentiation through a complex combination of viral proteins and non-coding RNAs. EBV gene expression programs change coordinately with the differentiating host-cell, and these changes have been referred to as latency types. EBNA2 is a potent transcriptional co-activator that is expressed in early stages of EBV-induced proliferation of naïve B-cells but is extinguished at later stages. EBNA2 is best characterized for its physical interaction with the sequence-specific transcription factors RBP-jκ (also called RBPJ, CBF1, and CSL) at promoters and enhancers of EBNA2-regulated genes. Recent genome-wide studies have revealed that EBNA2 frequently colocalizes with RBP-jκ, as well as other cellular factor binding sites, including Early B-cell Factor 1 (EBF1). EBF1 is a sequence specific DNA binding protein that functions as a B-cell identity factor necessary for the establishment of pro-B cells and maintenance of B-cell specific transcription programs. EBNA2 colocalizes with EBF1 and RBP-jκ at many enhancer and super-enhancer regions in EBV positive lymphoblastoid cell lines. EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival. EBNA2 is a viral mimic of Notch at some transcriptional regulatory elements, inducing the formation of new binding for both RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with transcriptional activation of linked genes that are important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EBNA2 leads to a rapid alteration in RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA depletion studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. In summary, EBNA2 plays a crucial role in EBV-induced B-cell immortalization through facilitating combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival.
The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector for dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. In Mexico, the Neovolcanic axis (NVA) acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypti populations, resulting in differences in their ability to transmit DENV2. The mosquito population north of the NVA has an average vector competence (VC) rate of 0.55, while the population south of the NVA has an average VC rate of 0.20. This variation is primarily due to midgut infection and escape barriers. The NVA also impacts the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. However, further studies are needed to determine the specific reasons for the NVA acting as a barrier to gene flow and the stability and epidemiological significance of the differences in vector competence between populations north and south of the NVA.
In this study, researchers examined the role of the DnaA protein in the initiation of bacterial replication. Previous studies have suggested that DnaA is the main controller of initiation frequency, with initiation occurring when a threshold concentration of ATP-DnaA has been reached. However, the researchers found that artificially increasing the concentration of ATP-DnaA in cells did not affect the timing of replication, suggesting that accumulation of ATP-DnaA alone is not sufficient to trigger initiation. Instead, other factors must be involved in the precise timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. The researchers also investigated the roles of datA-dependent DnaA inactivation (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA. They found that loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein, indicating that compromised cell cycle machines perform in a less robust manner. Overall, the study suggests that while DnaA is the main actor in initiation of replication, its accumulation does not control the time of initiation, and other factors are required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment.
A novel approach called partial Granger causality is introduced to analyze interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. This method is tested on toy models and successfully applied to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo multi-electrode array local field potentials recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep, and in vivo local field potentials recorded from distributed sites in the right hemisphere of a macaque monkey. Partial Granger causality outperforms conditional Granger causality in revealing the correct structure of interactions, especially when latent variables and common inputs are present. The approach is used to analyze HeLa cell cycle gene expression data, revealing three basic frequencies in the circuit and how genes interact with each other at the identified frequencies in the IκB-NF-κB circuit. Additionally, the approach is applied to multi-electrode array recordings from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep and transcortical bipolar electrodes from 15 distributed sites in the right hemisphere of a monkey, finding an additional interaction between two areas compared with conditional Granger causality analysis.
The authors present new methods for local ancestry inference in recently admixed individuals, using sequence data and leveraging continent-specific variants (CSVs) to increase performance. The proposed approach incorporates admixed genomes themselves jointly with public datasets, such as 1000 Genomes, to improve the accuracy of CSV calling. The method attains accuracy similar to widely used computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with large decreases in runtime. The authors also extend their approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and show that accurate local ancestry inference can be attained at low sequencing coverage. Additionally, they generalize CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs) and show that in some cases it is possible to determine the sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments on the basis of sCSVs. This new method has the potential to be useful in medical and population genetic inferences, such as finding disease-risk loci, inferring recombination rates, and mapping missing contigs in the human genome. The authors provide the method as a free software package for the community.
Mammalian circadian rhythmicity is widely prevalent, affecting 10%-15% of all genes, and driven by an intrinsic molecular clock in the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues. Statistical analysis of periodicity is limited by small datasets and high levels of stochastic noise. A new approach using digital signal processing algorithms identifies circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all expressed genes. Consequently, changes in gene expression caused by mutations or environmental factors should be evaluated in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations. Circadian rhythms are crucial for a complete understanding of both physiology and pathology in mammalian and other species. The existence of multiple oscillators in a system enhances its robustness. Analysis of time series gene expression data for periodic patterns is challenging due to the limited number of time points and high stochastic variation. In a study, researchers analyzed microarray timeline experiments from independent sources and found oscillating patterns with statistically significant circadian periodicity in as many as 99% of all genes present in the dataset. The digital filters improve the ability to identify oscillation pattern, resulting in the report of nearly 100% oscillating genes. The position-centering filter mimics the human eye observing the heatmap, while other filters mimic the human eye at it tries to follow the flow of curves. The order in which single profiles are concatenated can differ slightly, depending on the preliminary estimation of oscillation likeliness. Experimental validation of a few selected genes by qRT-PCR has confirmed the presence of an oscillating pattern in gene expression. The number of circadian oscillating genes far exceeds the expected 10%-15%, but is consistent with previously reported simulation studies. The source of the discrepancy results from the intuitive, but unfounded assumption made in the formulation of the null hypothesis applied to tests of gene expression profiles for periodicity. All algorithms for analysis of periodicity are at a disadvantage when applied to one gene at a time. Conversion of single gene profiles into a long continuous stream allows application of digital signal processing to reduce the noise and enhance the signal. The concept that most, if not all, genes in a living cell experience oscillation in expression is not surprising as basic cell metabolism is a natural oscillator in and of itself.
Whole-genome re-sequencing of a three-generation pedigree of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) was conducted to localize and characterize recombination events in an avian system. The study identified 325 meiotic crossover (CO) events and 267 non-crossover gene conversion (NCO) events in the flycatcher genome. The CO events were found to be concentrated in certain hot-spot regions, which were associated with genes, especially promoter regions and CpG islands. The male CO rate was higher than the female rate (3.56 cM/Mb vs. 2.28 cM/Mb) and showed positive CO interference up to a distance of 14 Mb. The location of NCO events was associated with the location of CO events, and a significant transmission distortion in favor of G and C alleles over A and T alleles was observed at NCOs, providing direct evidence for GC-biased gene conversion in an avian species. The study provides valuable insights into the characteristics and consequences of recombination in an avian system and highlights the importance of recombination in shaping avian genomes.
"Repeat-proteins are made up of repetitions of 20-40 amino acid stretches and fold into elongated, non-globular architectures. The folding of these proteins can be understood as a quasi-one-dimensional problem due to the symmetries in their primary sequence and three-dimensional structure. A family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins is used as a case study to illustrate the folding of repeat-proteins. The study shows that natural repeat proteins are ""poised"" at specific ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions. The internal symmetries of repeat-proteins suggest that the overall folding properties of a complete ""domain"" can be derived from a microscopic description of the energy balance within each folding element and its interactions with its neighbors. The one-dimensional nature of repeat-proteins implies simple relations for the experimental observables, such as folding free-energy (ΔGwater) and the cooperativity of denaturation (m-value). The parameters for the ""coarse-grained"" description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes."
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cancer associated with risk factors including obesity, alcoholism, and viral hepatitis. These conditions activate the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) or Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathways, but the role of these stress pathways in HCC has not been tested. Here, studies show that the ISR-regulated transcription factor CHOP promotes liver cancer. CHOP expression is upregulated in liver tumors in human HCC and two mouse models, and Chop-null mice are resistant to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Deletion of CHOP reduces levels of basal inflammatory signaling in the liver, and Chop-null mice are resistant to fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. These results suggest a model where CHOP contributes to hepatic carcinogenesis by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation, implicating CHOP as a common contributing factor in HCC development in various chronic liver diseases.
A systematic review of clinical studies was conducted to identify treatment options for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethiopica in Ethiopia. The review identified 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes, with the most commonly used drugs being antimonials, pentamidine, and cryotherapy. However, the studies suffered from methodological limitations and there was a lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Antimonials are the most available CL treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be better defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miltefosine or paromomycin, should be explored. High-quality clinical trials are urgently needed to evaluate several options in parallel, particularly for complicated CL due to L. aethiopica.CL is a chronic infectious skin disease caused by Leishmania parasites and can present in various forms, including localized CL, diffuse CL (DCL), and mucocutaneous CL (MCL).

In this study, the biochemical oscillator responsible for circadian rhythms was reconstituted in vitro using three purified proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. This oscillator displayed self-sustained 24-hour periodicity that was temperature compensated, similar to circadian rhythms. Time-dependent interactions of the three proteins were analyzed using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis to determine the timing of complex formation among the Kai proteins. These data were used to develop a dynamic model for the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduced the rhythms of KaiABC complexes and KaiC phosphorylation, and was consistent with biophysical observations of individual Kai protein interactions. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) confirmed that monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers occurred. The model demonstrated that the function of this monomer exchange may be to maintain synchrony among the KaiC hexamers in the reaction, thereby sustaining a high-amplitude oscillation. Temperature pulses were used to reset the phase of the KaiABC oscillator, allowing for the first perturbation analyses of an in vitro oscillator and testing of the resetting characteristics of this unique circadian oscillator. This study provides a detailed molecular understanding of circadian clockwork.
The brain's trial-to-trial variability and its correlation with behavioral performance have been investigated primarily through event-related potential (ERP) studies, which typically test for a monotonic relationship between the two. However, recent findings suggest that across-trial variability can correlate with behavioral performance independent of trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U-shaped relationship. This means that larger brain variability can be associated with better or worse behavior, respectively. A study using human electrocorticography (ECoG) found evidence of an inverted-U brain-behavior relationship in a visual stimulus detection task. When the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity was closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate was higher and reaction times were faster. Importantly, this relationship was present in both post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity and pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. These findings support attractor network theories and are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain. Additionally, the existence of both monotonic and inverted-U relationships between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance can be explained by the consideration of two sources of brain variability: deterministic and stochastic. A U- or inverted-U-shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance has been established in relation to various neuromodulatory influences, including arousal, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic systems. However, the possibility of a similar inverted-U function between trial-to-trial fluctuations of brain activity and behavioral performance is seldom tested. The vast majority of studies have only investigated a monotonic relationship between them by comparing trial-averaged brain activity between different categories of behavioral performance or computing the linear correlation between trial-to-trial brain activity and performance metrics. Recent studies have reported that trial-to-trial variability decreases after stimulus onset, suggesting that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task stimulation. Variability reduction can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. ECoG recordings show a dramatic reduction of across-trial variability in the post-stimulus period, reaching the minimum at 646 ms and gradually recovering to the baseline at around 2 seconds following the stimulus. Similar variability reduction was observed when the ipsilateral hand was used for motor output, and the magnitude of variability reduction was slightly larger than when the contralateral hand was used. The presence of stochastic noise in the brain imposes an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and performance, and recent studies have reported that trial-to-trial variability decreases after stimulus onset in neuronal spiking, fMRI signals, and ECoG recordings. Furthermore, the reduction of variability can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance.
The evolution of sexual development in eukaryotes, including fungi, is marked by both conservation and flexibility. In fungi, mating compatibility is determined by mating-type genes located in mating-type (MAT) loci. While ascomycetes and Mucoromycotina have bipolar mating systems with one MAT locus, basidiomycetes typically have tetrapolar mating systems with two genetically unlinked MAT loci. However, bipolar mating systems can arise in basidiomycetes through genomic linkage of the HD and P/R loci or when the P/R locus loses its function in determining mating specificity. Fusion of the HD and P/R loci has occurred independently in multiple fungal lineages, including the Trichosporonales and pathogenic Cryptococci. The analysis of MAT loci in 24 Trichosporonales species revealed that all of them have physically linked MAT loci containing both P/R and HD genes. However, the Trichosporonales have a unique and highly conserved gene content and order in their fused MAT loci, suggesting distinct mechanisms underlying the evolution of physically linked MAT loci in this group. The fused MAT loci in Trichosporonales may have provided evolutionary advantages, as they have been selected for multiple times in basidiomycetes.
Chagas disease is a major vector-borne parasitic disease in Latin America, with a significant transmission risk from non-domiciliated vectors. A mathematical model was developed and fitted to field data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses. The model accurately fitted and predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season. However, the reduction in bug abundance was not improved by larger doses or more frequent interventions and decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. Alternatively, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. Control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying, because it would require yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
Feathers in birds are arranged in a precise pattern in avian skin, arising from a row along the dorsal midline and spreading wave of new feather buds. This patterning is achieved through a reaction-diffusion-taxis system involving fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, mesenchymal cell movement, and a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20. The process is partly mechanochemical, with the mechanical compression of the epidermis intensifying FGF20 expression. The EDA/EDAR pathway plays a crucial role in this process in a quasi-1-dimensional manner, imposing ordered pattern formation. Feathers first appear during development, laying out a hexagonal lattice of feather primordia through a 2-dimensional space. The initiation of feather formation begins with the condensation of dermal mesenchymal cells beneath an epidermal placode. The feather primordium then grows into a filament within a follicle, branches internally, and produces a down feather by hatch. The process of laying out the periodic arrangement of feathers begins at stereotyped anatomical sites, laying down a row of feathers as the initiation of each tract, with new rows added progressively in parallel to existing ones. Both epithelium and mesenchyme are essential for periodic patterning and feather primordium formation, and this process fails to initiate if either tissue is maintained in isolation. The integrated intercellular signalling, mesenchymal cell movement and density, and mechanical processes drive feather pattern formation, with EDA/EDAR signalling as the critical signal driving the wave of patterning and spreading across a gradient of mesenchymal cell density. The appearance of cell aggregates, changes in gene expression, and the formation of the feather periodic pattern all occur simultaneously. Local epithelial FGF stimulates mesenchymal cell aggregation, which in turn activates both the expression of BMP4 and amplifies epithelial FGF20 production. BMP proteins diffuse and inhibit FGF production through transcriptional suppression of FGF20, resulting in the formation of discrete and characteristically spaced feather primordia. This structure of interactions is capable of breaking symmetry to produce a periodic pattern de novo. In silico modelling has shown that only when this patterning system is driven by a travelling wave of activation are the spatiotemporal progression of sequential row insertion and a uniformly hexagonal patterning outcome observed. A transient block on patterning in embryonic skin results in irregular primordium arrangements, consistent with the absence of a patterning wave. The nature of the wave that triggers feather patterning has been elusive, but recent research suggests that it relies on local tissue compression.
The 2013-2015 Ebola outbreak was unprecedented due to sustained transmission within urban environments and thousands of survivors. The World Health Organization stated that there was insufficient evidence to give definitive guidance about which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a risk to humans. A rapid systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors was conducted. The review found that for most body fluid types there were insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken >16 days after onset were usually negative. In the six studies that used both assay methods RT-PCR tests for filovirus RNA gave positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every otherwise confirmed patient. Apart from semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR positive samples are likely to be culture negative and so possibly of low infectious risk. However, it is not apparent how relatively infectious many body fluids are, even when culture-positive, not least because most test results come from more severe cases. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission due to the known high viral loads in blood.
The voltage trace of neuronal activities can exhibit multiples timescale dynamics due to correlated membrane conductances, resulting in power-law behavior that can't be characterized by a single time constant. This non-Markovian process can be modeled by a fractional derivative, which represents a non-local process determining the value of the variable by integrating a temporal weighted voltage trace, also called the memory trace. A fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model was developed and analyzed, with the exponent of the fractional derivative varying from 0 to 1. As the exponent decreases, the weights of the voltage trace increase, and the value of the voltage becomes more correlated with the trajectory of the voltage in the past. This model can reproduce upward and downward spike adaptations, longer first-spike latency, and high inter-spike variability with power-law distribution found experimentally in various types of neurons. The model also generates reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input, reflecting the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation.
Paracoccidioides, the etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, has the ability to defend itself against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host effector cells, which is crucial for its survival. The fungus expresses various antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases (SODs), to counteract these radicals. In this study, six SOD isoforms were identified in the Paracoccidioides genome. The expression of PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 was found to increase during the transition process, exposure to oxidative agents, and interaction with phagocytic cells, suggesting their role in combating superoxide radicals generated during host-pathogen interaction. Knockdown strains of PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 showed that these genes are involved in the response of the fungus against host effector cells, particularly the oxidative stress response, and in a mouse model of infection. Protein sequence analysis and functional analysis of knockdown strains suggest that PbSOD3 expression is linked with a pronounced extracellular activity while PbSOD1 seems more related to intracellular requirements of the fungus. Overall, the study suggests that Paracoccidioides actively responds to the radicals generated endogenously during metabolism and counteracts the oxidative burst of immune cells by inducing the expression of SOD isoforms.
The study investigates the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in vitro and in vivo, and the hypothesis that IDPs are predominantly associated with chaperones in the cell, providing them protection from degradation by proteases. High-throughput interaction studies were analyzed to determine if the predicted disorder of proteins correlates with their tendency to bind chaperones. The results, however, showed a negative correlation between predicted disorder and chaperone binding in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa species. This suggests that chaperone binding is primarily required for folding of globular proteins and that the primary reason for chaperone binding of mostly disordered proteins is promotion of assembly with partners. The study also found that IDPs that bind chaperones tend to bind other proteins as well. The data suggests that protection by chaperones is not a general explanation for the weak correlation of protein disorder with intracellular degradation rate, and that protein-protein interaction and tight control of proteolytic systems play a role in the survival of IDPs in the cell. These findings open up new perspectives on the role of chaperones, the regulation of proteolysis, and the behavior of IDPs in the cell.
The Drosophila genes, spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr), encoded Zn-finger transcription factors regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signalling pathway in the wing imaginal disc, are required for cell survival, proliferation in the central region, and vein patterning in the lateral regions. To identify candidate Salm/Salr target genes, microarray experiments were conducted, comparing the expression profile of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs. A complex transcription landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins in the wing disc was uncovered, with genes having their expression turned off and positively regulated by Salm/Salr. Loss-of-function phenotypic analysis of these genes indicated a requirement for wing growth and patterning for a fraction of them. The identification and analysis of candidate Salm/Salr target genes are critical to understand the genetic control of growth and patterning of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc by the Dpp pathway.
The human protein Plk4, a kinase involved in cell division, is regulated by its autophosphorylation-induced degradation and by SCF-mediated degradation promoted by its active kinase form. Plk4's homolog in C. elegans, ZYG-1, is similarly regulated. Overexpression of Plk4 or ZYG-1 leads to extra centrioles, while moderate inhibition of PP1, a major cellular phosphatase, can restore centriole duplication to a Plk4 mutant. However, strong PP1 inhibition in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification. A new pathway has been defined where PP1, I-2, and SDS-22 downregulate ZYG-1 protein abundance, and PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism. Mutations in the I-2 homolog szy-2 result in altered splicing and reduced I-2SZY-2 protein levels, suppressing centriole duplication failure in zyg-1 mutants. RNAi depletion of SDS-22, a leucine-rich repeat domain protein, also suppresses zyg-1 phenotypes, as does the sds-22 ( bs9 ) mutation, which has a G-to-A missense mutation in the coding region resulting in a single amino-acid substitution within the eighth LRR.
Leishmaniasis, a zoonosis that has been rapidly expanding and becoming more urbanized, is a significant public health concern with the etiological agent Leishmania ( Leishmania ) infantum infecting sand flies, wild and domestic animals, and humans. In the Americas, the disease has been spreading and occurring in complex networks of relationships between the etiological agent, sand flies, vertebrates, and susceptible hosts. Although dogs are considered the main reservoir in urban environments, other non-human hosts such as wild and synanthropic animals may also be involved in the maintenance of L. ( L.) infantum in endemic environments. In Brazil, VL was initially a rural and wild disease but has become urbanized and expanded to hundreds of municipalities, including populous urban centers and several capitals. The transmission patterns and epidemiological profiles of VL are varied and complex, and increasing environmental degradation has been shown to alter the composition and interaction of fauna, leading to modifications and adaptations in the biology of vectors and hosts of diseases like leishmaniasis. In the municipality of Campinas in southeastern Brazil, an autochthonous canine case of VL was reported in 2009 in an environmentally protected area (EPA) within the municipality. Since then, disease transmission has remained restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA. A cross-sectional study using molecular tools and serological techniques found canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six species of insects, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified in the EPA, and natural infection by L. ( L.) infantum was recorded in one Exapapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola. Natural infection by L. ( L.) infantum and Leishmania subgenus Viannia was also detected in two white-eared opossums ( Didelphis albiventris), a known reservoir of VL. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios is evident, and understanding the epidemiological profiles of VL and the particularities of each transmission area is crucial for the development of prevention and control measures.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression and play critical roles in various cellular processes, including those exploited by viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to evade the host immune system. EBV is an oncogenic virus linked to several human diseases, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic tumor common in South Asia. While viral proteins contribute to NPC cell migration and invasiveness, not all tumor tissues express these oncoproteins, suggesting other mechanisms may be involved. A previous sequencing study by the authors revealed that the EBV miRNA miR-BART9 was highly expressed in all EBV-positive NPC tissues. In this study, the authors used gain- and loss-of-function approaches to investigate the effect of miR-BART9 in EBV-negative and EBV-positive NPC cells. They discovered that miR-BART9 promotes the migration and invasiveness of NPC cells, which was confirmed by demonstrating that miR-BART9 specifically inhibits E-cadherin, a membrane protein that preserves cell-cell junctions and the epithelial phenotype, to induce a mesenchymal-like phenotype and promote NPC cell migration. These results suggest that high levels of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive NPC cells may contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor cells.
Ggsashimi is a command-line tool for the visualization of splicing events across multiple samples, offering a unique feature of creating aggregated plots for groups of experiments. It is an improvement over existing versions of sashimi plot generating programs as it uses popular bioinformatics file formats, is annotation-independent, and allows visualization of splicing events for large genomic regions. Developed in python, it generates R code for plotting. Ggsashimi is useful for large-scale projects and overcomes limitations of current implementations by eliminating the need for specialized annotation formats and supporting summarized views for hundreds of samples. It can be easily integrated into splicing analysis pipelines, facilitating interrogation of alternative splicing in large-scale RNA sequencing projects. Ggsashimi represents splicing events using the sashimi plot standard, with added features such as sample aggregation and intron length shrinkage for enhanced visualization. It is publicly available at <https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi>.
The cross-species comparison of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) is crucial for predicting CRMs and understanding their evolution, but it is hindered by the challenge of reliable sequence alignment and the inadequacy of existing models of DNA sequence evolution. To address these limitations, a model of CRM evolution is proposed that captures different modes of evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and background sequences. A probabilistic model of gains and losses of TFBSs is also presented. A computational framework is introduced that uses this model to solve the problems of CRM alignment and prediction. The alignment method is similar to existing methods of statistical alignment but uses the conserved binding sites to improve alignment. The CRM prediction method deals with the uncertainties of binding site annotations and sequence alignment in a probabilistic framework. The program, EMMA (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis), is demonstrated to improve both alignment and prediction of CRM sequences over several state-of-the-art methods. The alignments produced by EMMA are used to study binding site conservation in genome-wide binding data of key transcription factors in the Drosophila blastoderm, revealing that factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm and that binding sites in distal bound sequences tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions.
The piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) pathway is crucial for silencing transposons in the germline and maintaining genome integrity, but its functions during development are unclear. This study finds that mutations in Drosophila piRNA pathway genes, including armi, aub, ago3, and rhi, lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during the cleavage stage of embryonic divisions. Additionally, aub and armi mutations disrupt telomere binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduce expression of a subpopulation of 19- to 22-nt telomere-specific piRNAs. These findings suggest genetically separable functions for the Drosophila piRNA pathway, with aub, armi, rhi, and ago3 genes silencing transposons and maintaining chromosome integrity during cleavage-stage embryonic divisions and aub and armi having an additional function in assembly of the telomere protection complex. These results contribute to our understanding of piRNA pathway functions beyond transposon silencing and genome maintenance during development.
In November 2007, an outbreak of Hemorrhagic Fever (HF) in Bundibugyo District, Western Uganda, was found to be caused by a new species of Ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, which is most closely related to Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus. This new virus was responsible for 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths in the outbreak. The virus was identified through a combination of classic methods such as antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA, and a random-primed pyrosequencing approach. The discovery of this new virus has important implications for the design of future diagnostic assays, antivirals, and vaccines for Ebola HF, as the sequence divergence of this new virus relative to all previously recognized ebolaviruses is significant. The natural reservoir of ebolaviruses is still elusive, but recent data suggests that three species of arboreal fruit bats may be carriers of Zaire ebolavirus and a cave-dwelling fruit bat has been implicated as a natural host for marburgvirus. Filovirus outbreaks are sporadic, and the last new species of ebolavirus was discovered 14 years ago in Cote d'Ivoire. The antigen-capture, IgM, IgG, and newly designed real-time PCR assays were quickly transferred to the Uganda Virus Research Institute to facilitate rapid identification and isolation of Ebola cases for efficient control of the outbreak. The entire genome sequence of this virus was completed using a classic primer walking sequencing approach and revealed that the newly discovered virus differed from the four existing ebolavirus species with approximately 32% nucleotide difference from even the closest relative, Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus. This high level of genetic diversity translates to considerable amino acid differences in the encoded virus proteins, including the important determinant of virus tropism and pathogenicity, the virus surface glycoprotein, and immunosuppressive VP35 protein. Retrospective analysis of case description, epidemiologic, and laboratory data from the Bundibugyo outbreak is ongoing. This investigation highlights the power of molecular detection and characterization tools to quickly identify new pathogens while providing a cautionary note regarding sole dependence on molecular techniques such as real-time PCR assays for detection of novel agents in biodefense or emerging disease surveillance programs.
The progression rates of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) vary significantly among patients, with some transiting the stages of the disease over a period of months, while others take decades. This variability poses a challenge in assessing the efficiency of treatment strategies. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging procedure (FAST) are commonly used instruments to stage the course of AD, with each GDS/FAST stage having a published mean duration. However, the variance in stage durations is unknown. A statistical analysis of a cohort of 648 AD patients revealed that the standard deviations for stage durations are comparable with their mean values, indicating large variations in AD progression among patients. Such heterogeneity is consistent with the existence of several sub-groups of AD patients with different patterns of decline. Despite the usefulness of quantifying the average course of AD in terms of stage durations, it is essential to quantify the variance of GDS/FAST stage durations to judge the significance of any improvements observed in treatment strategies.
The study presents a model of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, focusing on its role in encoding and decoding memory patterns in a changing environment. The model is extended to include spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. The network is trained to adapt to changing input statistics in a sequence of spatial environments using three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. The simulations confirm that additive neurogenesis is the superior adaptation strategy, allowing the network to maintain high retrieval accuracy in new environments while preserving representations of earlier environments. Additionally, a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporates cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells has an overall performance significantly better than any one of the three individual strategies operating alone. This adaptation rule can be tailored to maximize the performance of the network when operating as either a short- or long-term memory store. The time course of adult neurogenesis over the lifetime of an animal raised under different hypothetical rearing conditions is also examined, with several distinct features that form a theoretical prediction that could be tested experimentally. Furthermore, the study shows that place cells can emerge and refine in a realistic manner in the model as a direct result of the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computational models in understanding the functional relevance of adult-born neurons and the importance of neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
African trypanosomes, the causes of human sleeping sickness and Nagana cattle disease, have a digenetic life cycle, multiplying as infective bloodstream (BS) forms in the blood and body fluids of their mammalian hosts and as procyclic insect form in the midgut of the tsetse fly vector. BS trypanosomes have one of the highest endocytic rates ever measured, with all vesicular trafficking of macromolecules taking place at the flagellar pocket. The lysosome is the final repository of cargo taken up from the host serum for nutritional and immune evasion purposes. BS trypanosomes lack catalase and selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases, and hydroperoxide detoxification is achieved by 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins and non-selenium glutathione peroxidase (Px)-type enzymes. RNA interference studies have revealed that both types of peroxidases are essential, but proliferation of the Px-depleted BS parasites can be fully restored by supplementing the culture medium with the vitamin E analogue Trolox. In this study, the authors focus on the role of Px III and the cytosolic Px I-II in the viability of BS T. brucei. They find that the px III knockout results in parasites that display only a minor and transient growth retardation in vitro, while parasites lacking the cytosolic peroxidases (px I--II−/− cells) die within less than two hours after transfer into Trolox-free medium. Further investigation reveals that, in the absence of Trolox, BS px I--II−/− T. brucei undergo lysosomal disintegration, followed by damage of the mitochondrion and likely other cellular membranes, and total cell lysis. This process is closely linked to the endocytic uptake of iron ions.
PMEL is a well-conserved amyloidogenic protein expressed in pigment cells, forming intralumenal fibrils in melanosomes where eumelanins deposit. Allelic variants in several species are associated with reduced eumelanin levels in epidermal tissues, although it's unclear if they're gain-of-function or loss-of-function. A mouse line with the Pmel gene inactivated (Pmel−/−) shows viable, fertile mice with no obvious developmental defects. Melanosomes in Pmel−/− melanocytes are spherical compared to the oblong shape in wild-type animals. Despite a mild effect on coat color, there's a substantial reduction in eumelanin content in hair. PMEL is essential for maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation. Vertebrates produce two types of pigment - red/yellow pheomelanins and black/brown eumelanins - with PMEL primarily involved in eumelanins synthesis. In mouse, PMEL expression starts in the retinal pigment epithelium and neural crest-derived melanoblasts, suggesting a function in the early stages of melanosome biogenesis. PMEL mutations in various species are associated with hypopigmentation, such as the silver allele in mice causing diluted black/brown eumelanins but no effect on pheomelanin, resulting in hair graying over time. PMEL fibrils have amyloid characteristics and may serve as a model for functional/non-pathological amyloid formation.
This study systematically reviewed and conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of environmental methods for dengue vector control. The review followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The CONSORT 2010 checklist was used for quality assessment. The meta-analysis calculated the difference-in-differences (DID) and difference-of-endlines (DOE) for the Breteau index (BI) and pupae per person index (PPI) for container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up campaigns, and elimination of breeding sites. Nineteen studies were included in the systematic review, and 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis.The study found that each of the investigated environmental methods showed some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies to strengthen this evidence. The meta-analysis showed that container covers without insecticides and waste management with direct garbage collection achieved the strongest reductions for the BI, whereas container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places showed the strongest effects for the PPI.The study concludes that environmental interventions can be effective in controlling the immature stages of Aedes sp. mosquitoes, but the link between the reductions of vector populations and risk of transmission is not clear. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence and clarify the link between vector populations and transmission risk.
"A new approach for therapeutic development is the identification of small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by stalling the ribosome, specifically targeting PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These compounds have shown promising results in preclinical models, reducing LDL cholesterol and affecting the translation of only a few off-target proteins. However, the impact of these compounds on cell physiology and ribosome quality control pathways is unknown. A genome-wide CRISPRi screen was conducted using a selective PCSK9 translational inhibitor, PF-06378503 (PF8503), to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth. The two most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503 are the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3, which bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Translation quality control proteins Pelota and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. These results provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation and will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease. Proteins are the main druggable therapeutic targets for the treatment of human diseases, but many proteins remain ""undruggable"" due to the difficulty in identifying small molecule or biological inhibitors of their function. An alternative approach is to prevent the synthesis of target proteins in the first place by targeting the step of translation. However, targeting translation in a highly specific way remains an unsolved problem. Genomic screens, such as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens, serve as powerful and unbiased tools to identify genetic modifiers of the action of small molecule inhibitors, reveal the pathways likely to be general cellular responses to the stress induced by translation inhibition, and suggest the cell dependencies most likely to be impacted by this class of inhibitors."
The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability plays a crucial role in controlling gene expression, ensuring transcript fidelity, and enabling cells to respond to environmental cues. However, unregulated enhancement of mRNA turnover can dampen cellular responses to signals. Herpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), induce widespread destruction of cellular mRNAs to block host gene expression and evade immune detection. KSHV promotes this phenotype via the activity of its viral SOX protein, which stimulates cellular transcriptome turnover through a unique mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. Transcripts in SOX-expressing cells exhibit extended poly (A) polymerase II-generated poly (A) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. SOX-induced polyadenylation changes correlate with its RNA turnover function, and inhibition of poly (A) tail formation blocks SOX activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly (A) binding proteins are critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear relocalization by SOX. SOX-induced mRNA turnover therefore represents both a novel mechanism of host shutoff and a new model system to probe the regulation of poly (A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. KSHV is the etiologic agent of several neoplasms, including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and the most common neoplasm associated with untreated HIV infection. KSHV undergoes both latency and lytic replication, and lytic KSHV infection destroys the host transcriptome by promoting global mRNA degradation via unknown mechanisms. The SOX protein mediates this host shutoff and has homologs across the entire herpesvirus family, but its mechanism of mRNA turnover remains unknown due to its lack of intrinsic ribonuclease activity. Instead, SOX likely functions by modulating one or more cellular RNA turnover pathways. Control of message stability represents a powerful means of regulating gene expression both on an individual and a global scale, and nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs are protected from exonucleolytic attack by a 5′ cap structure and a 3′ poly (A) tail. Cleavage and polyadenylation are cotranscriptional events, and polyadenylation generally serves to stabilize mRNAs, whereas in bacteria and some organelles, it facilitates RNA turnover. However, it is now becoming clear that polyadenylation can be a facilitator of eukaryotic mRNA degradation as well. In particular, yeast possess a nuclear polyadenylation complex that marks aberrantly processed RNAs for quality control-mediated turnover via the addition of short poly (A) tails. Analogous pathways may function in higher eukaryotes, as polyadenylated precursors to RNA turnover have also been detected in mammalian cells. Here, it is revealed that KSHV SOX-induced host shutoff is intimately linked to mRNA polyadenylation. SOX promotes aberrant polyadenylation of cellular transcripts in a manner dependent on its RNA turnover activity. Transcript degradation requires both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly (A) binding proteins, the latter of which undergoes striking nuclear relocalization in a host shutoff-dependent manner. In the absence of cellular 3′ end processing and polyadenylation, SOX can no longer target mRNAs for destruction, although addition of a templated poly (A) tail reinstates SOX-induced turnover. These findings suggest SOX is directing a novel polyadenylation-dependent mechanism of host shutoff and demonstrate a link between polyadenylation and mRNA destruction in higher eukaryotes.
The type III interferon (IFN)λ receptor, IL-28R, is highly expressed in the respiratory tract and is crucial for defense against some viral pathogens. However, its role in innate immunity against bacterial pathogens is unclear. In a study, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections in mice caused significant production of IFNλ in the lungs. IL-28R null mice showed increased clearance of these bacteria from the lungs, reduced lung pathology, and lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In vitro studies revealed that IFNλ downregulates microRNA miR-21, leading to sustained PDCD4 expression, which promotes inflammatory signaling. Mice lacking the IFNλ receptor or PDCD4 had improved clearance of both airway pathogens and less pathology, suggesting IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4 during bacterial pneumonia. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach for treating bacterial pneumonia by modulating IFNλ or inhibiting IL-1R.
A retrospective study over 23 years on 781 cases of advanced stage-2 sleeping sickness admitted at the National Reference Center for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo analyzed mortality trends and risk factors. Death was the outcome variable, with age, gender, disease duration, body fluid parasites, cytorachy, protidorachy, clinical status, and treatment regimen as predictors. The study found that clinical status on admission, high protidorachy, presence of parasites in the CSF, and high cytorachy were significantly associated with death. The algorithm for initial clinical status assessment can serve as a basis for standardized tools in the clinical management and information exchange in epidemiological reports of HAT.
A new imaging arena and tracking algorithm were developed to study the social behavior of large groups of Drosophila melanogaster flies. This allowed for the reliable tracking of a large number of flies and the creation of an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. It was observed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters. The genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes were then explored, and it was found that while behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one and were mostly in metabolic genes. These changes were verified through the increase of lipid content in isolated flies. Therefore, this new pipeline can be used to unravel the behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in Drosophila. Social interactions are a key feature of many species, and isolation is known to affect the onset and progress of diseases in humans. Socially interacting species are influenced by isolation, and changes in social conditions may influence gene expression patterns. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful genetic and neuroscience model for studying social behavior, but appropriate experimental setups, reliable tracking, behavioral classification, and detailed social network analysis are needed. The pipeline developed in this study includes an efficient and relatively low-cost acquisition setup, an improved tracking algorithm for up to 16 male flies, a machine learning method for classification of social interactions, and a novel algorithm for computing an average social network to analyze social structure. This pipeline was used to study behavioral changes due to isolation and correlate these with changes in genome-wide gene expression, resulting in the discovery of strong and specific effects of isolation on social network dynamics, metabolic gene expression, and animal physiology.
The study conducted in rural Bangladesh aimed to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines on the adherence to clinical guidelines for the treatment of diarrheal diseases. The 'Rehydration Calculator' was developed based on end-user feedback and evaluated during the fall 2015 cholera season at two hospitals. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for prescriptions of intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. A total of 841 patients were enrolled, and the intervention resulted in a decrease in the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids and an increase in the proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin. However, limitations, including an absence of a concurrent control group and no independent dehydration assessment during the pre-intervention, were noted. Despite these limitations, the study demonstrated the potential of a smartphone-based tool to improve guideline adherence, providing a foundation for a randomized controlled trial to expand on these findings. The study also highlighted the challenges faced by medical facilities in resource-limited settings, where logistical, educational, and temporal constraints can impact the quality of clinical care provided, particularly during outbreaks or seasonal swells of diarrheal diseases. The 'Rehydration Calculator' was developed to address some of these challenges by adapting the WHO diarrhea management guidelines onto a smartphone platform, with functionality including weight-for-age estimation, dehydration assessment, and treatment recommendations.
The dynamics of host-parasite interactions are crucial in determining the impact of climate change on disease, as both host and parasite traits can be strongly affected by temperature. However, the effects of environmental change on disease dynamics are difficult to predict due to the distinct temperature dependencies of host and parasite traits. A study using experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microsporidian parasite fitted a mechanistic model of within-host parasite population dynamics, using parameters specified by relationships arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicts host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely. This approach of linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host-parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) posits that the thermal dependencies of biological processes across levels of biological organization can be deduced from the thermal dependency of the basic metabolic rate of individual organisms. MTE further suggests that the Van't Hoff-Arrhenius model can predict an organism’s metabolic rate and related processes based on temperature. These models can inform classical models of host-parasite dynamics to estimate the net effect of temperature changes on disease prevalence and severity. The simplicity and generality of this framework provide a valuable approach for predicting the outcomes and consequences of infections for hosts and parasites in light of climate change.
GABAergic interneurons, which are outnumbered by excitatory cells in the brain, play a crucial role in maintaining normal brain activity. These interneurons come in various types that differ in their anatomical, physiological, and biophysical properties, leading to the hypothesis that individual types perform specific computations in neuronal microcircuits. Distinct connectivity motifs exist among these interneuron types, such as Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons preferably inhibiting the perisomatic regions and basal dendrites of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs), Somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons mainly targeting the apical dendrites of PCs, and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) interneurons mainly connecting to the dendrite-targeting SOM neurons, providing a disinhibitory circuit for the distal dendrite of PCs. A SOM-PV motif plays a key role in the redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition, while a SOM-VIP motif may control the PV/SOM-mediated redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition. This SOM-VIP motif, when optimized, can enable a switch between two distinct processing modes in which top-down inputs arriving at the apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or obliterated via VIP cell modulation. Mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP neurons, along with spike-frequency adaptation, short-term facilitation, and the absence of recurrent connections among both VIP and SOM neurons, underpins the amplification abilities of the microcircuit, allowing for signal amplification, frequency selection, and switching behavior.
Microbiota have a significant impact on various aspects of host phenotype, including disease, and can be linked to specific phenotypes through microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) that compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples. However, abundance differences may also reflect indirect effects due to microbial interactions. The authors of this study used techniques from statistical physics to develop a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The method corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in IBD. The study demonstrates that considering microbial interactions is crucial in MWAS to distinguish taxa directly linked to disease from those affected only through their interactions with other species.
Wolbachia, a common bacterial symbiont in insects, has been studied for its potential to restrict the transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Plasmodium. The majority of research has focused on DENV replication and has shown that Wolbachia effectively reduces DENV replication and transmission when introduced as a stable infection in the naturally uninfected host Aedes aegypti. However, several disease transmitting mosquito species remain recalcitrant to Wolbachia transinfection, and natural Wolbachia infection models have been examined to provide insight into Wolbachia-host-pathogen interactions. A study by Baton et al. found that wFlu infection in its natural host Ae. fluviatilis enhanced oocyst infection with the avian malaria parasite P. gallinaceum. Zele et al. also showed that in the natural mosquito-Wolbachia-Plasmodium combination, Wolbachia increased the susceptibility of Culex pipiens mosquitoes to P. relictum. A study by Mousson et al. found that Ae. albopictus naturally superinfected with the two Wolbachia strains wAlbA and wAlbB infection limited the transmission, but not replication of DENV. These studies suggest that the degree of pathogen modulation from different host-Wolbachia combinations can differ considerably depending on the mode of infection, the host, and the pathogen. Therefore, it is important not to base predictions of pathogen modulation in a particular host-Wolbachia strain combination on results obtained from divergent infection modes and host species. In this study, the effect of wAlbB on replication and transmission of DENV and WNV (Kunjin strain) in Ae. aegypti infected through both transient somatic infection and stable transinfection was compared. The results showed significantly lower Wolbachia infection densities in transiently infected Ae. aegypti when compared to the stable infected line. Both Wolbachia infection models displayed similar effects, blocking replication and transmission of both DENV and WNV (Kunjin strain). These results conclusively show that neither DENV nor WNV (Kunjin strain) infection is enhanced in Ae. aegypti either transiently or stably infected with wAlbB.
Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that play a crucial role in various cellular functions, including signal transduction. In vertebrates, the Inversin compartment (InvC) is a portion of the cilia shaft adjacent to the transition zone (TZ), and its mechanisms of establishment and maintenance are unknown. The roundworm C. elegans has a ciliated nervous system, with cilia shafts divided into two regions: a proximal microtubule doublet-based region attached to the TZ and a distal microtubule singlet-based region. It has been suggested that C. elegans cilia possess an InvC, similar to mammalian primary cilia. This study explores the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C. elegans ciliary doublet region and InvC, finding that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region. Genes associated with these regions modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region and the glutamylation modification of tubulin, a post-translational modification. The study concludes that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.
The study investigates the role of the polarity protein Scribble in the development and regeneration of myelin by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development, up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes, and localized to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation, while its conditional elimination in mice disrupts myelin initiation during development and following focal demyelination, and suppresses the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. These findings highlight the essential role of Scribble and other intracellular polarity regulators in myelination and remyelination, and provide new insights into the mechanisms of remyelination failure in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
Streptolysin S (SLS) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor produced by Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of various diseases such as pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Recently, it has been discovered that other notorious Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, and Staphylococcus aureus, also produce related peptides. The L. monocytogenes cluster is particularly interesting as it is found exclusively among a subset of lineage I strains, which are responsible for most outbreaks of listeriosis. The expression of these genes results in the production of a haemolytic and cytotoxic factor, Listeriolysin S, which contributes to the virulence of the pathogen. This discovery suggests that the genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of lineage I L. monocytogenes has been revealed, and the distribution of these genes may explain the reason for the enhanced virulence of certain strains of this pathogen. Bacteriocins, including Class I lantibiotics, have been of particular interest due to their unusual post-translational modifications, which are required for their activity. Most modified bacteriocins have been investigated for their potential applications in medicine or food, but two exceptional examples of bacteriocin-like modified peptides that are cytotoxic and contribute to the virulence of bacterial pathogens are the lantibiotic Cytolysin (Enterococcus faecalis) and Streptolysin S (Group A Streptococcus). Streptolysin S production is significant as it contributes to the cytotoxicity, inflammatory activation, and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) resistance of GAS, thereby playing a role in necrosis and systemic spread. In-silico analysis has demonstrated that gene clusters potentially encoding Sls-like factors are also present in some of the most notorious Gram-positive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium botulinum. A specific focus on the L. monocytogenes cluster has revealed that it encodes an inducible cytotoxic and haemolytic peptide, Listeriolysin S, which plays a role in the survival of the pathogen in PMNs and contributes to its virulence in the mouse model. Notably, the Listeriolysin S-associated cluster is strain variable, being present in a subset of isolates from lineage I, the evolutionary lineage associated with most epidemics associated with this often fatal pathogen.
Mycetoma is a chronic, progressive granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria, characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains surrounded by a significant inflammatory reaction. A study at the Mycetoma Research Centre in Sudan examined the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma lesions and its correlation with disease severity. The study found that IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was detected mainly in Zones II and III, with higher expression in Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis biopsies compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. The study also found a direct correlation between MMP-9 and IL-17 levels and the disease duration. These findings suggest that the expression levels of IL-17 and MMP-9 in mycetoma granuloma formation may be correlated with the severity of the disease, independent of the causative agent. Further studies are needed to investigate the precise function of IL-17 and MMP-9 in the formation of the mycetoma granuloma and their interaction with other cytokines and chemokines within mycetoma lesions.
"The Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family (EFS) includes IDPs that exhibit many features of ""fuzziness,"" a phenomenon characterized by IDP polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity, and a dynamic ensemble of disordered bound-state conformations. The transcriptional activation domain of the EFS oncoprotein family (EAD) is one such IDP, with multiple EAD aromatic side chains driving molecular recognition. A hypothesized polycation-π model suggests that EAD-target binding involves polycation-π contacts between a disordered EAD and basic residues on the target. Experimental effects of EAD sequence variations, including aromatic number, aromatic density, and charge perturbations, support this cation-π model, which is further validated by a coarse-grained EAD chain model and a corresponding analytical model. EAD-target binding is thus driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. This highly versatile mode of molecular recognition offers a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs."
Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has two putative ATP-dependent Lon proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2. Lon-1 is upregulated in response to blood, while Lon-2 is not. Both are expressed during culture in BSK-H medium. The presence of two lon gene homologs is rare in eubacteria, but appears to be unique to the genus Borrelia. Lon-1 and Lon-2 are closely related to each other but are distinct from the canonical Lons of E. coli and B. subtilis. Phylogenetic analysis of the NH2-terminal domains of Lon-1 and Lon-2 shows that they are especially dissimilar, suggesting that they may recognize different substrates. Lon-2 clusters separately from all other bacteria, indicating a close relationship exclusive to the genus Borrelia. B. burgdorferi Lon-1 was studied for its potential role in remodeling spirochete outer surface lipoproteins during the transition from the tick to the mammal and as a potential virulence factor. However, recombinant Lon-1 (rLon-1) did not show ATP-dependent proteolytic activity and was not able to degrade FITC-casein in the presence of ATP. The ATPase activity of rLon-1S714A confirmed that the ATPase and the proteolytic domains function independently, and that introduction of a mutation into the proteolytic domain does not affect the ability of Lon-1 to hydrolyze ATP. Further study of B. burgdorferi Lon function is needed to understand its role in the bacteria, but it is clear that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles and that Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with canonical Lon while Lon-1 has a unique role in host adaptation during the transition from tick to mammal.
Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-mediated antibody functions play a crucial role in preventing HIV infection, and one such function, antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), is thought to be involved in controlling other viral infections. However, the role of ADP in HIV infection is unclear. Researchers measured the ability of HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. They found minimal or no ADP of virions with any of the antibodies, but after coating virions with gp41 or gp41-derived peptides, gp41-specific mAbs efficiently mediated phagocytosis. A minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed. Phagocytosis or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection. In vivo studies have shown that FcγR-mediated antibody functions play an important role in preventing lentivirus infections, but there is no direct evidence to support the role of any particular FcγR-mediated function in protection. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) occurs when antibody-opsonized virions or cells bearing viral antigens are internalized via FcγRs into phagocytic cells. A related phenomenon known as trogocytosis occurs when membrane components from one cell are transferred to another, a process that can be mediated by antibody in an FcγR-dependent manner. Phagocytosis plays a key role in antibody-mediated protection against some viral pathogens, but internalization of antibody-opsonized dengue virus through FcγRs enhances infection of phagocytes and is thought to be a mechanism underlying severe dengue virus infections in humans. Several studies have begun to explore the potential role of phagocytosis in HIV infection, but the role of phagocytosis in preventing or enhancing infection remains unknown.
Human hookworm infection is a highly endemic disease in many low- and middle-income countries, affecting approximately 500 million people and causing 2,126,280 DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) in 2016. However, the global economic and health impact of hookworm is not well understood, and its economic burden exceeds published estimates for several diseases that receive more attention, such as rotavirus. The disease primarily affects children and adults and leads to iron-deficiency anemia, malnutrition, and chronic health problems. Despite mass drug administration programs, the disease burden remains high due to a lack of significant impact on hookworm-related anemia.To estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection, a computational simulation model was developed using a Monte Carlo method in Microsoft Excel and Crystal Ball add-in. The model determined the productivity losses and DALYs for hookworm infection by country, WHO region, and globally from the societal perspective. The model considered age-specific hookworm prevalence, intensity level of each hookworm infection, health outcomes, and productivity losses. The model estimated the probability of low, moderate, and heavy intensity infection and converted each case into health outcomes, resulting in productivity losses and DALYs.The model found that hookworm infection resulted in a total of 2,126,280 DALYs using 2004 disability weight estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 2010 disability weight estimates, excluding cognitive impairment outcomes. Total productivity losses varied, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages and $2.5 billion to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy for annual wages.In conclusion, hookworm infection has a significant economic and health burden, exceeding published estimates for several diseases that receive more attention. Despite control programs, hookworm's disease burden remains high, and a better understanding of its economic and health burden is necessary for decision-makers to determine how much time, energy, and resources to invest in hookworm control. The computational simulation model developed in this study provides a comprehensive estimate of the economic and health burden of hookworm infection and can inform decision-making for hookworm control.
Hypoxic injury to the developing human brain is a major cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in premature infants, but the mechanisms by which hypoxia disrupts connectivity in the central nervous system (CNS) are not well understood. Recent work in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that hypoxia causes discrete axon pathfinding errors, and a similar effect has been found in the forebrain neurons of zebrafish (Danio rerio) after developmental hypoxic injury. These pathfinding errors result from activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway and are mimicked by chemical inducers of the hif1 pathway or by expression of constitutively active hif1α. Blocking transcriptional activation by hif1α helps prevent the guidance defects. The receptor ephA4a is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons, and ephrinB2a, a target of hif1 pathway activation, mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Magnesium sulfate, which is known to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2a. These results suggest that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia and support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium.
This study focused on evaluating pulmonary lesions in an experimental model of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in mice using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathological analysis. Male BALB/c mice were infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis conidia and scanned using HRCT every four weeks to determine pulmonary lesions, quantify lung density, and reconstruct and quantify lung air structure. Lungs were also analyzed by histopathology and histomorphometry. The study found that HRCT is a useful tool for the evaluation and quantification of pulmonary damage in experimental mouse PCM. The experimental design decreases the need to sacrifice a large number of animals and serves to monitor treatment efficacy. The study also demonstrated that the infection causes granulomatous inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma leading to fibrosis and severe restriction of respiratory function. The model allowed for the evaluation of histopathological and immunological pulmonary tissue responses occurring during the active and residual stages of the process. The study suggests that recognition and monitoring of CT patterns associated with this model of disease could improve understanding of the anatomo-spatial distribution of lesions and their time course in the same animal. Additionally, imaging could also be used to evaluate in vivo therapeutic responses.
A novel marker for latent L. donovani infection, an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA), was proposed and tested to detect the cell-mediated immune response in VL. The study used a commercial kit, QuantiFERON, and evaluated five different leishmania-specific antigens from L. donovani. The study found that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. The assay based on SLA had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100%. The study also found that the positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with leishmania antigen in patients with active VL was contradictory to the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and needs further research. VL is a chronic systemic disease that is fatal if left untreated, and it is highly endemic in countries such as India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sudan, and Brazil. The study highlights the importance of identifying and documenting trends in incident L. donovani infections for the VL elimination initiative. Currently, serological methods and leishmanin skin testing are used to document incident infection, but their value as markers of infection is not firmly established. The study suggests that markers of the cellular immune response, such as T cell proliferation and IFN-γ released by activated T cells, hold promise for detecting latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A similar assay based on leishmania antigen might also be valuable for leishmaniasis. A recent study explored the use of a modified QuantiFERON assay to detect the cell-mediated immune response against L. infantum. The study developed a novel IFN-γRA based on the QuantiFERON test system and evaluated its potential to detect L. donovani infection.
Gastrointestinal infections caused by enteric yersiniae can lead to persistent complications such as relapsing enteritis and severe autoimmune disorders. The bacteria must cope with hostile surroundings to establish a persistent infection, which is enhanced by the CNFY toxin that induces inflammatory responses and extensive tissue destruction. Suppression of CNFY function increases interferon-gamma-mediated responses and facilitates the establishment of a commensal-type lifestyle. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infections in humans usually result in self-limiting gastrointestinal disorders but can occasionally lead to autoimmune disorders. The bacteria can persist in the intestinal mucosa and lymphoid tissue for several years, causing chronic ileitis, relapsing enteritis, and the development of reactive arthritis. A murine infection model for persistent Y. pseudotuberculosis infection revealed that sublethal infection results in prolonged asymptomatic colonization of the cecum and shedding of Yersinia with the feces in a fraction of mice. A cnfY mutant showed early reprogramming from virulent to persistent mode, which triggers a host response that allows a commensal-type life-style, promoting the establishment of asymptomatic, persistent infection. In summary, the CNFY toxin plays a crucial role in the persistence and pathogenicity of Y. pseudotuberculosis infections, and its suppression can increase interferon-gamma-mediated responses and facilitate the establishment of a commensal-type lifestyle, promoting the establishment of asymptomatic, persistent infection.
A novel pathogenicity gene, DES1, was identified in Magnaporthe oryzae, which is a significant rice pathogen causing blast disease. This gene plays a crucial role in counter-defenses against host basal resistance during colonization and further reproduction in host plants. The DES1 gene encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties and is conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes. The loss of DES1 in the fungus leads to the failure of host colonization and induces strong plant defense responses. The Δdes1 mutant displayed reduced infectious hyphal extension, resulting in decreased pathogenicity. The DES1 mutant also exhibited hypersensitivity to oxidative stress and a significant reduction in the activity and transcription level of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases. In the interaction with a susceptible rice cultivar, rice cells inoculated with the Δdes1 mutant exhibited strong defense responses, including brown granules in primary infected cells, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the generation of autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction in neighboring tissues. Furthermore, the suppression of ROS generation significantly reduced defense responses in plant tissues challenged with the Δdes1 mutant, allowing the mutant to recover its normal infectious growth. Overall, DES1 functions as a novel pathogenicity gene that regulates the activity of fungal proteins, compromising ROS-mediated plant defense.
Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection common in the tropics and subtropics, is transmitted through freshwater snails and its prevalence is influenced by environmental factors. In Ghana, the distribution of Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni is not even, with S. haematobium being more prevalent. Model-based geostatistics (MBG) is used to predict prevalence and determine intervention strategies. However, a study in Ghana found that using MBG to determine the appropriate treatment regimen for S. haematobium infection in schools would result in 28% of children being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment without need. The predictive map for Ghana is not adequate for guiding the national program and modelling must be a tool complementary to empiric assessments. Continual empiric testing and model refining is necessary for the practical usefulness of predictive risk mapping.
In the reproductive process, sperm must navigate through the female reproductive tract to locate and fertilize oocytes. While much is known about sperm motility in aquatic species, the mechanisms guiding sperm to oocytes in internally fertilizing animals are less clear. Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model for studying sperm behavior and fertilization due to its transparant epidermis, allowing visualization of sperm distribution and motility. Oocytes synthesize F-series prostaglandins (PGs) from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) provided in yolk lipoprotein complexes. These PGs function collectively and largely redundantly to promote sperm guidance. The synthesis of CePGF2, an analog of PGF2α, is dependent on 20-carbon PUFA synthesis and transport to oocytes. In mammals, mammalian cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways convert PUFAs into PGH intermediates, but C. elegans utilizes distinct biochemical mechanisms. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Bietti's Crystalline Dystrophy, negatively regulates prostaglandin synthesis. Overall, these results suggest a model where multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins function together to promote sperm motility important for fertilization, and this pathway may be conserved. These findings have implications for understanding the complex processes surrounding sperm guidance and fertilization, and may provide insight into potential targets for reproductive health and fertility treatments.
The immunogenicity of biotherapeutics can pose a significant barrier to their widespread clinical application, leading to the need for improved deimmunization technologies. A recent study describes algorithms that optimize proteins for reduced T cell epitope content while maintaining high-level function, revealing that there is no single global optimum for protein deimmunization. Instead, mutagenic epitope deletion yields a spectrum of designs with tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and molecular function. The Pareto frontier, or the set of undominated variants for which no other single design exhibits better performance in both criteria, has been designed, constructed, and evaluated experimentally for a therapeutic enzyme. Various measures of protein performance were found to map a functional sequence space that correlated well with computational predictions, representing the first systematic and rigorous assessment of the functional penalty that must be paid for pursuing progressively more deimmunized biotherapeutic candidates. These algorithms may prove useful in augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts.
In eukaryotes, sexual reproduction typically involves meiosis, which relies on a reciprocal exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes, known as crossover (CO). The frequency and distribution of COs are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, with more known about the molecular mechanisms governing the former. A study on Arabidopsis thaliana discovered that elevated temperature induces meiotic hyper-recombination, and the extra COs are derived from the major Type I interference-sensitive pathway. These findings suggest that environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and offer practical applications. Meiosis creates haploid gametes from diploid progenitor cells through a specialized form of cell division, characterized by DNA exchange between homologous chromosomes. CO formation is critical for stabilizing homologous chromosome pairing and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during meiosis. In Arabidopsis, approximately 200 DSBs are formed in each meiocyte, but only about 10 are repaired to form COs, while the remaining DSBs are repaired as non-crossovers. Perturbations in DSB frequency do not concomitantly alter CO frequency, indicating that CO frequency is under homeostatic control. However, CO number and position can be modulated by external factors such as nutrient availability, exposure to environmental toxins, stress, and temperature.
The paper describes a novel computational approach to help bench researchers analyze the vast and rapidly evolving terrain of molecular biomedicine data. The approach involves a knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods. Reading methods extract information from external resources, either structured or unstructured, and track knowledge provenance. Reasoning methods enrich the knowledge that results from reading by noting relationships between genes, such as two genes annotated to the same ontology term or database entry, and calculating a combined reliability score. Reporting methods visualize the combined network of relationships in a tool that facilitates the knowledge-based analysis of experimental data. The implementation of this approach, called the Hanalyzer, was demonstrated on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development. The tool was critical in the creation of hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development, which were validated by further experimental work. Human knowledge in biomedical research is expanding at an exponential pace, with over 10 million publications indexed by the National Library of Medicine and structured knowledge in the form of molecular biology relevant databases also growing at an impressive rate. However, even with the U.S. National Institutes of Health investing over $52 million to support ontology development and use, it is still unable to keep up with the volume of relevant publications, making it difficult for biomedical researchers to keep up with biomedical knowledge. The Hanalyzer system constrains knowledge to be compatible with the Web Ontology Language and represents relationships as binary or n-ary, depending on the number of individuals or values linked. The system uses the practice recommended in the W3C working group note Defining N-ary Relations on the Semantic Web to represent more than one other individual or value. The system begins from a target list of genes of interest from a particular experiment, and extracts relationships describing protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions from databases and the literature. The system combines relationships from different databases and assay types, and assigns reliability scores to each assay type. The system also extracts protein transport events, protein-protein interaction assertions, and what proteins are expressed in which cell types from the literature using the OpenDMAP system. Overall, the system helps bench researchers navigate the vast and rapidly evolving terrain of molecular biomedicine data and facilitates the knowledge-based analysis of experimental data.
Fasciola hepatica, a helminth parasite, releases extracellular vesicles (EVs) which can modulate host immunity. These EVs have surface proteins and oligosaccharides that interact with host cell surfaces. In a study, two EV sub-populations, 15k and 120k, were found to have different origins - 15k from gastrodermal epithelial cells and 120k from the protonephridial (excretory) system. Proteomic analysis revealed 380 surface proteins, including virulence factors, membrane transport proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Glycan analysis showed that while both EV populations had high mannose sugars, their lectin profiles differed from each other and from the parasite surface tegument. PNGase F, but not exo- and endo-glycosidases, remodeled the surface oligosaccharides and blocked EV uptake by host macrophages. Pre-treatment with host antibodies or purified antibodies against specific EV surface proteins enhanced EV uptake by macrophages. This study shows the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways in F. hepatica and the molecular interaction between parasite EVs and host cells, providing insights into the development of therapeutic blocking agents.
A study has identified the transcription factor CDF2 as a regulator of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in plants. CDF2 interacts with DCL1, a key protein in miRNA processing, and affects the accumulation of a population of miRNAs. CDF2 binds directly to the promoters of certain miRNAs and acts as a transcription activator or repressor. It preferentially binds to the pri-miRNAs it regulates and affects DCL1-mediated processing of these pri-miRNAs. Genetically, CDF2 works in the same pathway as miR156 or miR172 to control flowering. The study highlights the importance of proper miRNA levels in controlling plant development and the role of CDF2 in maintaining these levels by regulating miRNA transcription and processing.
Folliculogenesis, the process of ova production for reproductive life, requires bidirectional communication between oocytes and granulosa cells through a physical connection that conveys signals and metabolites. A study has discovered that oocyte geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a metabolic intermediate in protein geranylgeranylation, is required to establish this communication. GGPP and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (Ggpps) levels in oocytes increase during early follicular development. Depletion of GGPP impairs granulosa cell proliferation, primary-secondary follicle transition, and female fertility. GGPP depletion inhibits Rho GTPase geranylgeranylation and its GTPase activity, causing the accumulation of cell junction proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm and failure to maintain the physical connection between oocyte and granulosa cells. Additionally, GGPP ablation blocks Rab27a geranylgeranylation, which may account for impaired secretion of oocyte materials such as Gdf9. Immunohistochemistry assays demonstrated that Ggpps is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of the oocyte at all follicular developmental stages. Oocyte-specific Ggpps knockout mice show a novel function of GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation in the oocyte during the primary-secondary follicle transition. Oocyte GGPP is required for Rho GTPase-regulated physical connection between oocyte and granulosa cells and Rab GTPase-directed secretion of oocyte materials such as Gdf9 and thereby has a profound impact on both the oocyte-granulosa cell communication and ovarian primary-secondary follicle transition.
"The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a crucial eukaryotic enzyme that synthesizes messenger RNA using a DNA template. Despite extensive studies, it remains uncertain whether the ""secondary channel"" is the only route for NTPs (nucleoside triphosphates) to reach the enzyme's active site, or if the ""main channel"" could be an alternative. Existing crystallographic structures of Pol II have been helpful in understanding the structural basis of transcription, but the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the full transcription bubble (TB) is still unknown. To gain a complete understanding of the Pol II transcription process, determining the structural information of the full TB is essential because the diffusion routes of NTP substrate through the main channel might overlap with the TB region. In a study, a structural model of Pol II with a complete TB was built using multiple sources of existing structural data and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations together with structural analysis. The study found that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription, as it has twice the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading compared to the main channel. Additionally, the diffusion of NTP through the main channel is disfavored due to electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the NTP loading routes and the role of the TB conformation in the transcription process."
Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is a significant public health problem in many countries, including Thailand and Cambodia. Although dengue is a reportable disease in these countries, the actual disease burden is underrecognized due to underreporting of cases. A study was conducted using dengue incidence data from laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases in prospective cohort studies in Thailand and Cambodia to estimate the magnitude of dengue underrecognition and establish accurate disease burden estimates. The study found that during 2003-2007, there was an 8.7-fold underrecognition of total symptomatic dengue cases and a 2.6-fold underrecognition of inpatient dengue cases in Thailand. In Cambodia, there was a 9.1-fold underestimation of total symptomatic dengue cases and a 1.4-fold underestimation of inpatient dengue cases during 2003-2007. These findings demonstrate that the true burden of dengue is significantly higher than what is reported through national surveillance data, emphasizing the need for improved surveillance and reporting systems to better understand and manage the disease.
In this study, researchers aimed to understand the role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in promoting protective immune responses to viral infections. While it is known that NK cells can control viral replication, their role in orchestrating global antiviral defense is unclear. The researchers used mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as a model system to examine the consequences of NK cell dysfunction on antiviral CD8 T cell responses. They found that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection in vivo by limiting IFN-α/β production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through the early control of cytomegalovirus, which dramatically reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) for cytokine production, preserves the conventional dendritic cell (cDC) compartment, and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. These results suggest that NK cells play a critical role in balancing the intensity of other innate immune responses, dampening early immunopathology, and promoting optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. This extends NK cell's role beyond their direct antiviral effects and highlights the importance of intricate relationships between NK cells and other innate leukocytes in the development of antiviral immune responses.
In eukaryotes, rRNA genes are arranged in head-to-tail tandem arrays with not all copies being transcribed under normal growth conditions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, four major rRNA gene variants have been identified, with one being induced and another, the most highly represented variant, reactivated in Atnuc-L1 mutants. These changes in rRNA gene expression are due to a novel mechanism controlled by the nucleolin protein, which plays a major role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis. This mechanism involves IGS transcription and symmetric DNA methylation. Further analysis of the rRNA gene variants in A. thaliana revealed at least three major variants, VAR1, VAR2, and VAR3, with VAR1 being silent in wild-type plants but derepressed in A. thaliana plants lacking the AtNUC-L1 protein. VAR1 is differentially expressed in WT plants, being detected essentially in seeds imbibed for 48 hours, though a very weak band is amplified in roots and flowers. In 2-day germinating seedlings expressing the rRNA VAR1 gene, the rRNA chromatin is immature with several FISH signals observed using a 25S probe, but these are smaller compared with those observed in 15-day old plants. These results suggest that rRNA variants are developmentally regulated in A. thaliana plants and chromatin state plays a major role in controlling the expression of rRNA VAR1. Additionally, pre-rRNA cleaved at the primary cleavage site in the 5′ETS region accumulates in Atnuc-L1-1 mutant plants, and northern blot analysis revealed accumulation of 45S pre-rRNA and processing in the 3′ETS region in Atnuc-L1-1 plants. An RNase protection assay confirmed that the mapped cleavage sites are located upstream from four repeat sequence elements named R1 to R4.
In this study, the role of histone deacetylation in regulating human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gene expression was examined. The researchers used a method for rapid immunoisolation of an epitope-tagged protein coupled with mass spectrometry to identify candidate HDAC1-interacting proteins in the context of infection. They confirmed the interaction of pUL38 and pUL29/28 with HDAC1 using reciprocal immunoprecipitations. The researchers found that multiple components of the NuRD complex, including RBBP4 and CHD4, are needed for efficient HCMV replication. They also showed that pUL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs. The HCMV lytic replication cycle involves dynamic changes in histone modifications, and HDACs have been identified within multi-protein complexes such as NuRD. Disruption of the NuRD complex has a profound impact on cellular differentiation and proliferation and is associated with metastatic cancer. In HCMV, the virus-coded IE2 protein interacts with HDAC1 and 2 and auto-regulates viral gene expression. Inhibition of HDACs during CMV infection hyperactivates immediate-early gene expression, overcomes the repressive effects of hDaxx at the MIEP, and substantially rescues the growth of an IE1-deficient virus. HCMV-coded IE1 protein binds HDAC3 and promotes viral replication by antagonizing histone deacetylation. Proteins from several other herpesviruses bind to and modulate HDACs, and modulation of deacetylases occurs during human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The researchers identified constituents of the NuRD complex as interacting partners of a tagged HCMV UL38-coded protein at 24 hpi, indicating a possible interaction between the viral protein and the NuRD complex. They then performed a global search for putative HDAC1-interacting proteins in the context of infection and validated several of the interactions, including the formation of complexes between components of the NuRD complex with the HCMV-coded proteins, pUL38 and pUL29/28. pUL38 is an early protein that controls cellular stress responses, and pUL29/28 is necessary for efficient viral replication. The interaction between pUL38 and HDAC requires pUL29/28, and blocking expression of NuRD components inhibits replication of a wild-type virus. The researchers demonstrate that full activation of the HCMV MIEP requires pUL29/28 but not pUL38. They propose that HCMV co-opts NuRD function at least in part to enhance expression of its immediate-early genes.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pneumonia in infants, resulting in 57,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Although high titers of neutralizing antibodies appear to ameliorate the disease process in infants less than 9 months of age, individuals remain susceptible to RSV upper respiratory tract reinfection life-long. RSV isolates can be classified into two antigenically distinct groups (A and B) with genetic differences occurring primarily in the attachment glycoprotein G (47%) and to a lesser degree in the fusion protein F (9%). This study aimed to analyze the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection and trace its evolution through adolescence and adulthood.Whole genome-fragment phage display libraries (GFPDL) expressing linear and conformational epitopes in the RSV fusion protein (F) and attachment protein (G) were used for unbiased epitope profiling of infant sera prior to and following RSV infection. F-GFPDL analyses demonstrated modest changes in the anti-F epitope repertoires post-RSV infection, while G-GFPDL analyses revealed a 100-fold increase in number of bound phages. The G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-terminus of the G ectodomain, along with increased reactivity to the central conserved domain (CCD). Panels of F and G antigenic sites were synthesized to evaluate sera from young children (<2 yr), adolescents (14–18 yr), and adults (30--45 yr) in SPR real-time kinetics assays. A steady increase in RSV-F epitope repertoires from young children to adults was observed using peptides and F proteins. Importantly, several novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. In all age groups, antibody binding to pre-fusion F was 2--3 folds higher than to post-fusion form. For RSV-G, antibody responses were high following early RSV infection in children, but declined significantly in adults, using either G proteins or peptides. This study identified unlinked evolution of anti-F and anti G responses and supportive evidence for immune pressure driven evolution of RSV-G. These findings could help development of effective countermeasures including vaccines.
Filarial nematodes, which include those causing lymphatic filariasis and river blindness, affect millions of people in tropical and subtropical regions, with the existing drugs used in mass drug administration being ineffective against adult filariae. Emodepside, a veterinary anthelmintic, has been found to have macrofilaricidal effects and is being considered for the treatment of onchocerciasis. It has been shown to inhibit motility in nematodes by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically the SLO-1 K channels. Emodepside has a higher potency in males than in females, as demonstrated in Brugia malayi and Onchocerca volvulus. The slo-1 gene, which encodes SLO-1 channels, has several isoforms, and alternative splicing in the RCK1 binding pocket affects emodepside potency. This suggests that the sex of the filarial target is an important therapeutic variable to consider when evaluating a dose-regimen for treatments during clinical trials. Emodepside is currently in the process of being developed as the first registered oral macrofilaricide treatment for onchocerciasis, with DNDi planning to run a Phase II “proof-of-concept” clinical trial in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine where annual mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. These tests detect a Wuchereria bancrofti glycoprotein in the blood of infected individuals via a carbohydrate moiety recognized by the monoclonal antibodies AD12 and DH6. However, recent research has identified loiasis cross-reactivity as a serious obstacle to LF elimination in loiasis-endemic areas. This cross-reactivity is due to the presence of multiple L. loa proteins in LF RDT-positive loiasis sera, including both secreted and somatic proteins. These reactive L. loa antigens appear to be only transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with loiasis. The key differences between the circulating antigens of W. bancrofti and L. loa can be used to differentiate positive results generated by both species and may lead to improved diagnostic tests for LF and loiasis. This research involved the testing of adult human sera and was conducted to identify filarial antigens in the blood of persons infected with L. loa that could cause false-positive LF RDT results. The information obtained from this study may lead to the development of improved diagnostic tests for both infections.
Primary cilia are specialized sensory and developmental signalling organelles present on most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders known as ciliopathies, such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). The formation, maintenance, and function of cilia depend on intracellular transport systems like intraflagellar transport (IFT), driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors, and regulated by the BBS cargo-adaptor protein complex or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, researchers used the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, they discovered a signature expression profile enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, they uncovered orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, which is associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, revealed that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. These findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveil RAB28 as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.
The brain represents the outside world using neural responses, but it cannot directly access external stimuli and must decode them using only neural responses. The study of stimulus reconstruction usually involves characterizing the space of relevant stimuli, constructing functions relating stimuli to neuronal responses, and using these functions to decode new stimuli. However, the brain does not have access to independent stimulus measurements and must use neuronal spiking activity to represent the external world. In the context of hippocampal place cells, which reflect spatial information in rodents, a new question arises: how can the output of these place cells be used by downstream structures to reconstruct position and the underlying space, without access to corresponding place fields? This study shows that a great deal of information about a physical environment can be obtained using only very coarse features of population spiking activity. By defining a 'cell group' as a collection of cells that collectively fire significantly above baseline within a broad (~250 ms) temporal window, the simple knowledge of which groups of hippocampal place cells fire together is enough to extract global topological features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space within which the animal's position can be faithfully tracked. This is made possible by using standard tools from algebraic topology and graph theory, without requiring place fields, precise spike timing, or any prior independent measurements of position. Therefore, even without access to direct relationships between neural responses and external stimuli, the brain can compare neural responses to each other and reveal structure of the outside world using relationships between stimuli.
Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe and potentially fatal disease caused by excessive inflammation in the liver in response to a viral infection. A study using a mouse model of FH, induced by murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), found that the virus induces severe disease and high mortality in wild-type mice, but not in mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1-/-) or in mice treated with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). The virus-infected IL-1R1-/- mice and IL-1Ra-treated mice had reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. The study found that IL-1R1 deficiency impairs the virus-induced FGL2 production in macrophages and CD45+Gr-1high neutrophil infiltration in the liver. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is responsible for the cleavage and activation of pro-IL-1β, is required for the in vivo bioactivation of proIL-1β during MHV-3 infection. Mice deficient in NLRP3 or Caspase-1, two essential components of the inflammasome complex, have reduced IL-1β induction and ameliorated hepatitis. The study suggests that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis is a critical signaling pathway that is overactivated and directly causes severe liver disease during viral infection. These findings provide insights into the development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.
Hookworm infections, caused by Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, are major global health issues, leading to significant morbidity in terms of anemia and iron deficiency, particularly in children living in tropical regions. Despite their importance, the assessment of hookworm species-specific prevalence and infection load is rarely done due to limitations of current diagnostic methods. A study in Malawi used multiplex real-time PCR to determine the prevalence, infection load, and association of A. duodenale and N. americanus with severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. The study found that both species were present in the study population, with A. duodenale being more prevalent (26.1%) than N. americanus (4.9%). Moderate and high load A. duodenale infections were positively associated with severe anemia and iron deficiency. The study demonstrated the need for quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections using multiplex real-time PCR as a powerful diagnostic tool to combat anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource-poor settings.
In meiosis, the successful completion of meiosis requires the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, only HR can generate the interhomolog crossovers (COs) needed for meiotic chromosome segregation. In Caenorhabditis elegans gametogenesis, COM-1, the homolog of CtIP/Sae2/Ctp1, is crucial for the repair of meiotic DSBs via HR and the formation of COs. COM-1-deficient germ cells repair meiotic DSBs via the error-prone pathway NHEJ, resulting in a lack of COs, extensive chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. COM-1 promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting the NHEJ complex Ku, and it acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at the early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase. In the absence of both COM-1 and Ku, animals are viable and proficient in CO formation. These results reveal the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identify a critical role for COM-1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells.
Melioidosis is a significant public health threat in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative, non-spore forming, aerobic, and motile bacillus. The disease has a high mortality rate, and both B. pseudomallei and its close relative, B. mallei, are classified as category B bioterrorism agents. In Thailand, B. pseudomallei is widely distributed in water and wet soils, and human infections occur through dermal inoculation, inhalation, and ingestion. Melioidosis clinical presentation includes pneumonia, sepsis, and chronic abscesses in internal organs, and it can be treated if diagnosed early and correctly. However, current bacteriological methods for detection are too slow to guide early treatment. Therefore, there is a need for a sensitive, specific, and rapid test for diagnosis of melioidosis.A study using a caprine melioidosis model of aerosol infection has the potential to characterize the humoral immune response and identify immunogenic proteins for new diagnostics and vaccine candidates. Outbred goats may more accurately mimic human infection, in contrast to the inbred mouse models used to date. In this study, B. pseudomallei infection was delivered as an intratracheal aerosol, and antigenic protein profiling was generated from the infecting strain MSHR511. Humoral immune responses were analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and the antigenic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The results showed a much greater humoral response with IgG antibodies, in both breadth and quantity, compared to IgM antibodies. Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins already reactive for IgG and IgM in most of the goats, and after infection, the number of IgG reactive proteins showed a marked increase as the disease progressed.Further analysis of the immune reactive proteins in goats and humans with melioidosis showed many common proteins, indicating that the caprine model can provide significant insight into the understanding of pathogenesis and immune response. The systemic study of the immune response and antigenic protein detection can help find potential candidates for the diagnostics of the infection in the early stage of disease process. Understanding the progression of immune response through an animal model could give insight into how the host reacts to B. pseudomallei infection and what antigens contribute to immune reactivity. The research also provides detailed information on the antigens that induce an immunological response during infection, which can be useful for vaccine development.
A positive feedback loop triggers the activation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 at the end of G2, marking the start of mitotic entry. Following this, mitotic exit and cell division occur due to the destruction of cyclin B1, which inactivates Cdk1. The kinetics of Cdk1 activation have been studied through a novel approach that measures the temporal development of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity in single cells. This method quantifies the dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and phosphorylation of the Cdk1 target anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome 3. The results indicate that cyclin B1-Cdk1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation, with cytoplasmic cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. A bistable circuit model accurately describes these experimental data. The required levels of cyclin B1-Cdk1 to enter mitosis are lower than the amount needed for mitotic progression, and increasing cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is crucial for coordinating mitotic progression.
In the pursuit of an effective HIV-1 vaccine, identifying the appropriate epitopes to target remains a significant challenge. Studies of natural HIV-1 infection have identified four primary epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope: the MPER in gp41, the CD4-binding site, glycopeptide residues in the V1/V2 region and also the V3 loop. However, a small number of individuals develop antibodies that can't be mapped to these regions, suggesting additional epitopes play a role in a broad and potent neutralizing response. A study examining superinfection (SI), or sequential infection from different source partners, found that this did not induce a dominant Nab response to any one of the four main epitopes in 21 women infected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D. Furthermore, computational analyses suggested that the majority of the women’s Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These findings support a model where SI with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, providing backing for vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs. This research highlights the complexity of HIV-1 and the need for further investigation into the epitopes that can induce a broad and potent Nab response.
Congenital Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide, but the mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well-defined. A recent study found that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected neural progenitor cells (NPCs) through the HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1). The IE1 protein leads to Hes1 depletion by mediating Hes1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by acting as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase. This study suggests a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes1 protein to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by HCMV infection. The findings also complement the current knowledge of herpesviruses by identifying IE1 as the first potential HCMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.HCMV infection of NPCs results in depletion of the Hes1 protein via a mechanism that requires de novo viral protein synthesis. The Hes1 downregulation occurs as early as 12 hours post infection (hpi) and requires de novo viral protein synthesis, suggesting the potential involvement of HCMV proteins present during the IE phase of infection. The major IE proteins (IE1 and IE2) and the most abundant input virus component pp65 were introduced into NPCs via nucleofection with plasmids pCDH-IE1, pCDH-IE2 and pCDH-pp65, respectively. The results showed that IE1 or IE2 lead to markedly lower Hes1 protein levels, with IE1 showing a stronger down-regulating effect on Hes1 than IE2.The IE1 protein reduces the expressed Hes1 protein amount in a dose-dependent manner, and IE1 knock-down restores Hes1 protein level during virus infection. The Hes1 protein was distributed evenly across mock-infected NPC nuclei, but upon HCMV infection, Hes1 was observed to relocate and concentrate at sub-nuclear areas where IE1 was present at 4hpi. An IE1/Hes1 interaction along with Hes1 downregulation was observed in TNwt- and TNrvIE1-infected cells, but not in TNdlIE1-infected cells. The IE1/Hes1 interaction is independent of nucleic acids and likely resulted from a direct protein-protein interaction.In summary, HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected NPCs through the HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) by mediating Hes1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying HCMV-induced neurological disabilities and highlights the potential of IE1 as a target for therapeutic intervention.
This study focused on understanding how variations in regulatory sequences contribute to divergence in gene expression, specifically in blastoderm embryos of four Drosophila species (D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis) representing much of the diversity in the 40 million-year-old genus Drosophila. Gene expression, measured by mRNA-seq, was compared to genome-wide binding, measured by ChIP-seq, of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning.Key findings include mRNA levels being more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in a gene's expression being poorly explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. Highly bound sites, sites in regions bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding, suggesting that a considerable amount of transcription factor binding is weakly or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection.The authors concluded that considerable transcription factor binding has diverged within the Drosophila genus, with binding intensity varying extensively between species and relatively few regions bound by any factor in all four species. Additionally, changes in the distribution of TF-specific binding sites across the genome contribute to the observed binding divergence.The study also highlighted the importance of Zelda (Zld) in chromatin and transcription factor binding, with the Zelda effect being conserved among Drosophila species. Lastly, mRNA levels were found to be highly correlated between species, with the correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance, while overall divergence of mRNA levels was significantly lower than divergence of any TF's binding.
The monitoring and evaluation guidelines of the programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis require impact assessments through transmission assessment surveys (TAS) in at least one sentinel and one spot-check site in each implementation unit (IU). However, these guidelines may miss sites with transmission potential and their statistical assumptions have not been validated. A study in two primary health centers in Thanjavur district, India, addressed these issues by examining the prevalence and intensity of microfilaria (Mf) and antigenaemia (Ag) in a large-scale epidemiological study. The study found that, despite low Mf and Ag levels, there were residual and transmission hotspots with high prevalence of Mf and Ag. The presence of these hotspots and the spatial clustering of infections indicate the need for developing good surveillance strategies for detecting hotspots, adopting evidence-based sampling strategies and evaluation unit size for TAS. The global programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, launched in 2000, aim to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 through annual single dose mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole with diethylcarbamazine citrate or ivermectin for at least 5-6 years. By 2010, the programme had made significant progress in 53 of the 72 endemic countries, delivering billions of treatments to nearly 897 million people in the world. India, which contributes to nearly one-third of the global burden of LF, aims to achieve LF elimination by 2015. However, the impact of the programme is monitored once in two years in each IU by screening the population in at least one sentinel and one spot-checks sites for Mf. Several endemic countries have reported that delivering 5-6 rounds of MDA reduced the prevalence of Mf and Ag in many IUs. In India, it has been reported that in 192 of the 250 IUs Mf-prevalence has reached <1% – the recommended threshold for proceeding with further epidemiological assessment. Such an assessment is required prior to making a decision to stop or continue MDA in these IUs. The WHO monitoring and evaluation guidelines (2005) required a multi-step process to be completed before MDA could be stopped. The recommended sampling strategy for stopping MDA in an IU is to test a cluster design based lot quality assurance-cluster sampling (LQAS) of 10 young children for Ag-status and if no positives are found, an additional LQAS of 3000 school entrants drawn from the entire IU for Ag-status. MDA has to be stopped if no Ag-positives are detected by (ii). The above procedure is applicable only when (a) the Mf-prevalence is <1% in both sentinel and spot check sites, (b) Mf-prevalence is <1% in 5-10 additional sites of high risk transmission, and (c) Ag is negative among children aged 2-4 years in all these sites. Although this rigorous process was designed to ensure that transmission was stopped with a high degree of probability, it was cumbersome. Therefore, the WHO has revised the guidelines in 2011 and proposed TAS for making decision to stop/continue MDA. TAS are to be carried out in IUs that have completed at least five rounds of MDA, each with >65% coverage and with Mf-prevalence of <1% in both sentinel and spot check sites.
The organophosphate larvicide temephos is a widely used method for controlling dengue vectors, particularly in water storage containers. A systematic literature review of 27 studies (11 single intervention and 16 combined intervention) found that temephos, when used alone, consistently reduced entomological indices, but the same effect was not observed when it was used in combination with other interventions. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that temephos use is associated with reductions in dengue transmission. The community-effectiveness of temephos was found to be dependent on factors such as quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental factors. The timing of temephos deployment and its need for reapplication, along with behavioral factors and operational aspects such as cost, supplies, time, and labor, also impact its effectiveness. Overall, while temephos has been shown to be effective in controlling Aedes breeding sites, its impact on dengue transmission when used in combination with other interventions is less clear. Integrated surveillance activities may need to be implemented along with vector control interventions to address the knowledge gap in dengue epidemiology and vector control efficacy.
The cohesin complex is responsible for holding sister chromatids together from the time of their duplication in S phase until their separation during mitosis. Cohesin is found along the length of chromosomes but is most abundant at the centromere and surrounding region, the pericentromere. The Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor, Csm3, are both important for pericentromeric cohesion but act through distinct mechanisms. The Ctf19 complex directs the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere, while Csm3 is essential for the functionality of cohesin in holding sister centromeres together. Cells lacking Csm3 show additive cohesion defects in combination with mutants in the Ctf19 complex. Delaying DNA replication rescues the cohesion defect observed in cells lacking Ctf19 complex components, but not Csm3. It is proposed that the Ctf19 complex ensures additional loading of cohesin at centromeres prior to passage of the replication fork, thereby ensuring its incorporation into functional linkages through a process requiring Csm3.
Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) are significant public health concerns, with 100 million estimated infections occurring annually in tropical and subtropical areas. A systems level characterization of serum metabolome and lipidome of adult DF patients at early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent stages of DENV infection was performed using liquid chromatography- and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analysis identified 60 differential metabolites, including free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids, and perturbed metabolic pathways such as fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and steroid hormone pathway. The metabolites were significantly perturbed during the early stages and normalized to control levels at the convalescent stage, suggesting their potential utility as prognostic markers. The study demonstrates the value of omic approaches in understanding the extensive, concurrent, and dynamic host responses elicited by DENV, offering plausible physiological insights into the self-limiting nature of DF.
Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has increased, but significant need-gaps in diagnostic and treatment tools remain. An analysis of bibliometric data from published research reveals that from 26,833 publications from around the world that addressed 11 diseases, 1,187 (4.4%) had at least one German author affiliation. Of those, 972 publications were processed for the five most published-about diseases, and 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions were extracted to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil, with collaborations with partners on the African continent remaining scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions. Strong performers on an individual level were identified using classic parameters such as number of publications and h-index, as well as social network analysis parameters such as betweenness centrality. The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases. The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research, underlining the need to identify barriers and expand Germany’s otherwise strong research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators that are used to identify opportunities for collaboration. Using free tools to analyze research processes and output could facilitate data-driven health policies. Findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.
"Haiti has made significant progress in controlling Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), specifically lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), through a successful mass drug administration (MDA) program led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population. By 2012, Haiti's NTD program had reached full national scale, enabling it to stop LF treatment in most of the country. Key programmatic elements included strong community awareness, respected community members as drug distributors, directly observed treatment, easy access to treatment, and quality data collection.Haiti's experience has contributed to the global portfolio of ""best practices"" for NTD control. The country's success in implementing and assessing NTD programs can provide valuable insights for other countries implementing integrated NTD programs. ENVISION, a USAID-supported project led by RTI International, plays a significant role in Haiti's NTD program, working with IMA World Health to implement activities in 19 countries, including Haiti.In Haiti, ENVISION has achieved high treatment coverage, with 100% geographical coverage in 2012 and national coverage targets reached for both STH and LF in most communes. Post-treatment coverage surveys confirmed coverage rates of at least 65%. The factors most strongly associated with taking the treatment were access and awareness of the program.Between 2010 and 2014, the per-person treated cost of the program remained steady at $0.35-0.37. However, in 2014, an increase in total budget was necessary for more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation efforts, including TAS surveys.Haiti's NTD program will need to sustain achievements in reducing STH burden as the LF program meets criteria for stopping MDA. The country plans to focus on school-based, STH-only MDA and add water, sanitation, and hygiene activities. Strategies utilized by the program, such as strong community awareness and engagement, easily accessible treatment, and leveraging existing relationships, have significantly contributed to its success and can serve as a foundation for other countries implementing MDA campaigns."
Sinorhizobium meliloti is a beneficial bacteria that can either live freely in the soil or form a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with specific legume hosts. During this symbiosis, S. meliloti undergoes significant cellular differentiation within host root cells, resulting in massive genome amplification, cell branching and/or elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. The cell cycle regulation in S. meliloti is not well understood, but recent research suggests that the master regulator CtrA may play a key role in cellular differentiation during symbiosis. In S. meliloti, depletion of CtrA causes cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to the differentiated bacteroids in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. The cell cycle regulated proteolytic degradation of CtrA is essential in S. meliloti, suggesting a possible mechanism of CtrA depletion in differentiated bacteroids. However, S. meliloti CtrA regulates similar processes as C. crescentus CtrA through different target genes. The findings provide valuable insight into how highly conserved genetic networks can evolve, possibly to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria.
Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious bacterium causing tularemia, has the ability to multiply and survive inside macrophages, which is crucial for its virulence. A study investigating intracellular growth-deficient mutants of the F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) identified a gene, FTL_0766, encoding a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). The mutant strain with an insertion in FTL_0766 showed impaired intracellular multiplication and strong attenuation for virulence in mice. The GGT activity of F. tularensis allows utilization of glutathione (GSH) and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as cysteine sources to ensure intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the essential role of a nutrient acquisition system in the intracellular multiplication of F. tularensis. The capacity of this intracellular bacterial pathogen to utilize the available GSH as a source of cysteine in the host cytosol is a paradigm of bacteria-host adaptation.
Leishmania parasites, which cause various diseases in humans and animals, have a complex life cycle that involves alternating between flagellated promastigotes in insect vectors and round-shaped amastigotes in mammalian host cells. These parasites reside in parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) within infected host cells, and the characteristics of these PVs can vary depending on the species of Leishmania. For example, Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes are found in large PVs that can contain many parasites, while Leishmania major amastigotes are enclosed in small, tight PVs. In order to study the interactions between PVs of different Leishmania species, researchers infected mouse macrophages with L. amazonensis amastigotes and then superinfected them with fluorescent L. major amastigotes or promastigotes. They found that PVs containing L. major promastigotes fused with pre-established L. amazonensis PVs, but L. major amastigotes were excluded from these chimeric vacuoles and remained in their own unfused PVs. Within these unfused PVs, metacyclic-enriched L. major promastigotes differentiated into proliferating amastigotes, while log phase promastigotes were destroyed. These results suggest that PVs can have different abilities to fuse with each other and that a species-specific PV is required for the destruction or differentiation of L. major parasites. Further study of these interactions may provide insight into the mechanisms of Leishmania pathogenesis and intracellular survival.
A study investigating the ability of native, membrane-expressed JR-FL Env trimers to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) found that uncommonly potent nAb titers developed in two of eight rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers and one of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost. These sera neutralized via quaternary epitopes and exploited natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of JR-FL gp120. The trimer VLP sera took advantage of the unusual absence of a glycan at residue 197, and removing the N197 glycan rendered 50% or 16.7% (n=18) of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to the two trimer VLP sera. Neutralizing sera targeted epitopes that overlap with the CD4 binding site, consistent with the role of the N197 glycan in a putative “glycan fence” that limits access to this region. These findings suggest that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes and inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.
The traditional surgical treatment of Buruli ulcer (BU) has been supplemented with a combination chemotherapy of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin, which has improved treatment outcomes and reduced recurrence rates. However, wound healing after successful specific therapy remains a challenge, particularly in rural African areas with the highest disease burden. A study has identified markers to monitor wound healing in antibiotic-treated BU lesions through immunohistochemistry. The study analyzed tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions collected before, during, and after chemotherapy. The results showed that α-smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblasts, which produce extracellular matrix proteins, emerged during the healing process. After antibiotic treatment, many cells, including myofibroblasts, showed an activated phenotype, as indicated by ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. Healing wounds also revealed dermal tissue remodeling by apoptosis and showed increased cytokeratin 16 expression in the epidermis. These markers may help understand disturbances responsible for wound healing delays observed in some BU patients. BU is a necrotizing skin disease caused by M. ulcerans, primarily affecting subcutaneous tissue and leading to extensive tissue destruction and ulceration if untreated. The disease is prevalent in 30 mainly tropical countries, with the highest incidence in West Africa. It primarily affects children and the elderly and can lead to permanent morbidities. The currently recommended treatment is daily administration of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin for 8 weeks. BU presents with various clinical forms, including nodules, plaques, edema, and ulcers. Wound healing is a complex process consisting of four overlapping and integrated phases: rapid homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils characterizes the inflammatory phase, which cleans the wound area and releases cytokines to stimulate fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and other elements involved in the subsequent phase of the wound healing process. The proliferative phase is characterized by epithelial proliferation and migration through a temporal extracellular matrix composed of several proteins, including fibronectin, tenascin, and pro-collagen I, which support fibroblast migration into the wound bed. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells are abundant at this time and support capillary growth and formation of granulation tissue. Myofibroblasts are the main producers of collagen in healing wounds. Initially, type III collagen is produced and then replaced by type I collagen. Myofibroblasts can contract by using a smooth muscle type actin-myosin complex and are involved in the contraction and closure of wounds. After healing is complete, myofibroblasts are normally eliminated by apoptosis and are present only sub-epithelially in mucosal surfaces. However, myofibroblasts seem to persist in wound granulation tissue that fails to resolve after healing, which is considered to be the cause of excessive matrix deposition in hypertrophic scars.
Mitochondrial traffic and distribution along axons are crucial for maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis in neurons, especially in areas remote from the cell body due to high energy demands and variable impulse activity. Mitochondrial positioning at these sites is essential, and understanding its relation to impulse conduction in vivo is key. In vivo confocal imaging of saphenous nerves in anesthetized mice, combined with electrical and pharmacological stimulation of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, revealed that low-frequency activity increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in silent axons. Higher frequency conduction (50 Hz) dramatically further increased anterograde, but not retrograde, mitochondrial traffic, by rapidly increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and gradually increasing their velocity. Stationary mitochondria in axons conducting at higher frequency become shorter, presumably through enhanced fission, providing additional mitochondria to the trafficking population. Mitochondria recruited to the mobile population do not accumulate near Nodes of Ranvier, but continue to travel anterogradely, suggesting that peripheral terminals of sensory axons represent sites of particularly high metabolic demand during physiological high-frequency conduction. Axonal mitochondrial biogenesis mainly occurs at the cell body, and increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic may represent a mechanism that ensures a uniform increase in mitochondrial density along the length of axons during high impulse load, supporting the increased metabolic demand imposed by sustained conduction.
Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT) is a recessively inherited disorder caused by loss of function mutations in Filamin B (FLNB), characterized by progressive vertebral, carpal, and tarsal bone fusions, short stature, and scoliosis. A study using a Flnb knockout mouse found that intervertebral discs (IVDs) of Flnb–/–mice undergo rapid and progressive degeneration during postnatal development due to abnormal cell fate changes in the IVD, particularly the annulus fibrosus (AF). The AF cells lose their typical fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes, leading to hallmarks of endochondral-like ossification. This change is coincident with upregulated TGFβ signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP-induced p38 signaling as well as sustained activation of canonical and noncanonical target genes p21 and Ctgf. The IVD disruptions in Flnb–/–mice resemble aging degenerative discs and reveal new insights into the molecular causes of vertebral fusions and disc degeneration. Skeletal dysplasias are a group of disorders characterized by abnormalities in patterning, development, and maintenance of the skeleton, with congenital vertebral deformities causing chronic pain and deformity. The mechanisms underlying the development of these fusions are poorly understood. The study of these disorders and the use of appropriate animal models are crucial to understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing effective treatments.
The Thogoto virus (THOV), an orthomyxovirus, targets the polymerase complex through its Matrix protein long (ML) associating with TFIIB, a general transcription factor. This leads to the inhibition of type-I interferon (IFN-α/β) genes expression, a crucial part of the antiviral response. However, ML does not cause general inhibition of gene expression or apparent toxicity. The researchers used AP-LC-MS/MS to identify proteins involved in IFN-α/β inhibition by THOV and found TFIIB and CAPN15 specifically enriched in ML samples. ML specifically binds to TFIIB, leading to its re-localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, interfering with its function in RNA transcription. This specific binding to TFIIB is necessary and sufficient to interfere with IFN-α/β induction, while ML binding to CAPN15 does not affect induction of type-I interferons. ML does not reduce the abundance of TFIIB or PIC proteins or affect general translation rates in THOV infected cells. ML binds to TFIIB, altering its subcellular distribution and preventing it from contributing to transcriptional processes.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the genus Erythroparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae. It causes fifth disease or slapped cheek syndrome in children but can also cause hematological disorders, particularly in immunocompromised patients. B19V infects human erythroid progenitors at the burst-forming unit and colony-forming unit-erythroid stages in the bone marrow and fetal liver, leading to their death and causing various hematological disorders. The viral genome contains a P6 promoter that encodes non-structural protein NS1 and a 7.5-KDa protein, while the right side of the genome encodes two capsid proteins and an 11-kDa protein. NS1 is essential for replication of viral DNA and regulates viral gene expression. B19V infection inhibits differentiation of BFU- and CFU-erythroid progenitors, induces apoptosis of infected erythroid progenitors, and causes cell cycle arrest at G2-phase, resulting in a DNA4N/BrdU- phenotype. B19V NS1 induces G2-phase arrest through its predicted transactivation domain TAD2, which is independent of the p53 pathway. B19V infection also induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that is essential for viral DNA replication but has no effect on cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. Here, a study used genome-wide RNA-seq analysis to identify genes that are regulated by the NS1 TAD2 domain and function in NS1-induced G2-phase arrest. The results showed that the TAD2 domain is predominantly responsible for the transactivation of cellular genes in NS1-expressing cells and mediates activation of ATR, which phosphorylates CDC25C at serine 216, thereby inactivating the cyclin B/CDK1 complex and inducing G2-phase arrest. These findings provide insights into the mechanism underlying B19V NS1-induced G2-phase arrest and the role of the NS1 TAD2 domain in the dysregulation of the cell cycle.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes a significant global disease burden. The virus's nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been implicated in viral replication, immune evasion, and endothelial dysfunction. Specifically, DENV NS1 has been shown to disrupt the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL) and induce endothelial hyperpermeability both in vitro and in vivo. A recent study further examined the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways in DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability.The study found that DENV NS1 triggers localized vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type mice in a TLR4- and TNF-α-independent manner. In vitro experiments using human dermal endothelial cells demonstrated that NS1 does not induce the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-8. Furthermore, blocking these cytokines did not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. These findings suggest that DENV NS1-induced endothelial cell-intrinsic vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines.Additionally, the study showed that DENV NS1-induced vascular leak is dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components. In vitro and in vivo experiments using inhibitors targeting molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption were able to block DENV NS1-induced vascular leak. These findings highlight the importance of the endothelial glycocalyx in maintaining vascular integrity and the potential of targeting glycocalyx-degrading enzymes as a therapeutic approach for treating severe dengue disease.In summary, DENV NS1 induces endothelial hyperpermeability via a TLR4- and TNF-α-independent, but glycocalyx-dependent, mechanism. These findings contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
In budding yeast, cytokinesis is initiated by the assembly of a septin ring at the bud emergence site, which serves as a scaffold for other proteins involved in cytokinesis. The correct positioning of the cleavage furrow is crucial for equal distribution of genetic information and prevention of aneuploidies that can lead to tumorigenesis. The spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) ensures proper spindle orientation along the mother-bud axis before chromosome segregation into daughter cells. The SPOC is regulated by the Kin4 protein kinase, which keeps the Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex active, preventing mitotic exit until the spindle is properly aligned. Dma1 and Dma2, two redundant ubiquitin-ligases, regulate septin ring integrity, spindle positioning, cytokinesis, and SPOC. They control septin dynamics by promoting efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck, which, in turn, activates Kin4. Artificial recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck in dma1 dma2 cells is sufficient to restore normal septin ring, proper spindle positioning, and a proficient SPOC response. These findings suggest that septin dynamics and SPOC function are interconnected and that bud neck integrity is crucial for SPOC signaling. Simultaneous lack of Dma1 and Dma2 causes cell lethality in the absence of the PAK kinase Cla4, indicating that Dma proteins might regulate septin dynamics. Dma1 and Dma2 are implicated in septin ring stability and SPOC by regulating the bud neck localization of the Elm1 kinase. Impaired recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck in dma1Δ dma2Δ mutant cells results in decreased Elm1-dependent phosphorylation of Kin4 on T209 and in misregulated localization of the Bub2/Bfa1 complex at the poles of mispositioned spindles without affecting Elm1 kinase activity. Constitutive recruitment of Elm1 at the bud neck through a chimeric protein is sufficient to rescue the septin defects and the SPOC failure of dma1Δ dma2Δ cells, indicating that the checkpoint defect in these cells is indeed due to loose Elm1 association with the bud neck. Thus, Dma ubiquitin ligases play a crucial role in septin dynamics and SPOC response in budding yeast.
The paper discusses the role of climate in shaping human genetic variation. The authors scan the human genome for selection signals by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate across 61 worldwide populations. They find a significant enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those that are strongly correlated with climate variables. These signals include SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases, and are enriched in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection and immunity, and cancer. These results suggest that adaptations to climate have shaped the spatial distribution of variation in humans. Previous studies have shown that climatic factors like temperature and humidity play an important role in determining species distributions and influencing phenotypic variation of populations over geographic space. Human populations occupy a wide variety of environments with respect to climate, leading to varying selective pressures across geographic regions. Adaptations to spatially varying selective pressures are evident in the geographic distributions of many traits, such as body mass, pigmentation, and metabolism. To accurately assess whether a correlation between a genetic variant and latitude or climate is due to natural selection, it is crucial to control for population history, which can pose several challenges. Here, the authors use the same allele frequency data analyzed in Hancock et al. (2010) to test for adaptations to continuous climate variables at the genome-wide level and to identify genetic loci that underlie these adaptations. They find that several genome-wide scans for selection have been conducted in humans, but only two used information about the environment to detect signatures of selection on a genome scale. However, these previous studies used less informative variables compared to those used here. The present analysis detects new selection signals compared to those reported in Hancock et al. (2010) and those from other genome scans for selection. Importantly, while the adaptations to diet, subsistence and ecoregion tended to coincide with susceptibility SNPs for metabolic diseases and traits, the signals identified in this study show a different pattern, with a prominent role for pigmentation and immune response phenotypes. Therefore, through this approach, the impact of different selective pressures can be examined by testing for different environmental variables.
The Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. A study used Markov chain (MC) models to investigate arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the SQT1 variant of the SQTS, caused by the N588K mutation in the KCNH2-encoded hERG. The MC models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models in reproducing experimental data regarding the effects of the N588K mutation on IKr. These ionic channel models were then incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealized and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. The N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) during APs in single cell models. However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of IKr density in the intact tissue model, the N588K mutation led to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves in 2D and 3D tissue. The N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue. This highlights the importance of considering tissue substrate in understanding the arrhythmogenic effects of ion channel mutations.
A study has shown that deep attention networks can be used to create a model of animal collective behavior that is both predictive and insightful, offering a solution to the lack of important elements in simple models and the complexity of detailed models. The network was tested using simulated and experimental trajectories of zebrafish and was able to recover the ground-rule interaction used to generate the simulated trajectories and extract details such as the number of interacting neighbors and the rules of interaction. The network extracts that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbors, with higher weights for closer neighbors, those on a collision path, or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. The network also shows that each animal dynamically selects information from the collective, suggesting a new way of understanding and modeling collective behavior.
The study presents a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness cost of major resistance mutations in HIV-1 using data from the Swiss HIV cohort study. The approach employs stochastic birth-death-sampling processes, which have been shown to be suitable for modeling epidemic processes. The transmission tree is modeled using two types: hosts infected by a sensitive or resistant strain. This allows quantification of fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug sensitive strains. The study found that among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains. The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations all included 1, suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. The study provides a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations and validated it using HIV-1 sequence data from the Swiss HIV cohort. The findings of this study can be used to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution and to inform treatment decisions.
The study reveals that the fission yeast Sin3/Elp3, a component of the Elongator complex, is important for oxidative stress survival. While the stress transcriptional program is affected in mutant cells, the main cause of stress phenotypes is the deficiency in tRNA modification and subsequent translation inefficiency of certain stress-induced, highly expressed mRNAs. These mRNAs have a high number of lysine-coding codons AAA versus AAG, resulting in poor translation after stress in cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 or Ctu2. This shows that the transcriptional defects of these strains are a secondary consequence of the deficient expression of a transcription factor, Atf1-Pcr1, and other components of the transcriptional machinery. In unicellular organisms, the major changes in microbial gene expression programs arise due to extracellular stresses. These changes are achieved by transcriptional events, with a shift of the transcriptional machinery from growth- to stress-related genes. The MAP kinase Sty1 pathway is essential for inducing massive changes in the gene expression programs in response to environment insults. The histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and SAGA component Gcn5, as well as the Elongator complex, contribute to stress survival, and genetic defects in non-essential components of these complexes can render phenotypes of sensitivity to stress.
Primate lentivirus Nef is a multifunctional pathogenicity factor that is required for sustained virus replication in vivo and accelerated progression to AIDS. While Nef is known to increase the infectivity of cell-free virions, the mechanism by which it does so remains unclear. This study explores the potential link between Nef and Env, specifically focusing on the impact of Nef on the sensitivity of HIV-1 to neutralizing agents. The results indicate that Nef confers resistance to certain neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that target the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of TMgp41, including 2F5 and 4E10. This resistance was observed across a range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, and primary isolates. Functional analysis of Nef mutants revealed that this activity requires Nef myristoylation but is genetically separable from other Nef functions. Additionally, glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV was found to substitute for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. Overall, these findings suggest that Nef alters MPER recognition in the context of the virion membrane, protecting lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies. This newly discovered activity for Nef has important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
The snail Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos is the intermediate host of the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, which is a leading cause of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Greater Mekong sub-region of Thailand. A study was conducted to examine differences in gene expression profiling between uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos using high-throughput sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analyses. The transcriptomes of uninfected and infected snails were compared, resulting in the identification of 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 43 distinct biological pathways. Many of these pathways are related to immune defense mechanisms against parasites. Specifically, transcripts encoding distinct proteases displayed the highest down-regulation in Bithynia specimens infected by O. viverrini, while transcription of genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins was significantly up-regulated in parasite-infected snails. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between the parasite and its snail host and could inform the development of novel strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of O. viverrini-induced CCA.
Leprosy is a public health issue, particularly in Brazil, where it causes significant social stigma. A case-control study was conducted to understand the role of Complement Receptor 1 (CR1) in differential susceptibility to leprosy. CR1 binds complement fragments C3b/C4b deposited on mycobacteria, mediating its entrance in macrophages. The study investigated CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 (sCR1) levels in Brazilian leprosy patients. Nine polymorphisms were haplotyped in 213 patients and 297 controls. mRNA levels and sCR1 were measured in up to 80 samples. The most common recombinant haplotype, harboring rs3849266*T and rs3737002*T, was associated with twice the susceptibility to leprosy (OR = 2.43, p = 0.017) and lower sCR1 levels in paucibacillary patients, reducing the anti-inflammatory response. The most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to multibacillary clinical form (OR = 3.04, p = 0.01) and presented the intronic rs12034383*G allele, associated with higher gene expression, probably increasing internalization of the parasite. CR1 polymorphisms may regulate mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy.
This summary discusses the use of metabolomic profiling and genetic association data to investigate the effects of genetic variation at the molecular level. Serum metabolite concentrations can provide a direct readout of biological processes and have been associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. A study of over 3,300 individuals found significant concentration differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites. Sex-specific genome-wide association studies (GWAS) also showed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus for glycine. These findings suggest that the metabolite profiles of males and females are significantly different and that specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism. The study highlights the importance of considering sex-specific effects in studies, as gender inequalities can affect the interpretation of metabolic results. It is important to minimize confounders and consider the role of sexual dimorphism in order to better understand the contribution and complex interaction of genes, proteins, and metabolites in health and disease.
Genome-scale metabolic networks are a comprehensive framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. However, the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically large, requiring optimization-based approaches for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function used in these algorithms is directly linked with the biological hypothesis underlying the model and is therefore crucial for successful modeling. A new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl), has been proposed which decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions by casting objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. This method allows for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation and has been successful in elucidating the mechanistic basis of several genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Metabolism is a fundamental aspect of a living cell and has become a focal point of study in many disciplines. Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a structural framework for integrative data analysis and quantitative modeling of cellular metabolism. Constraint-based optimization approaches are commonly applied for simulating metabolic fluxes by searching for an optimal flux distribution that maximizes or minimizes an appropriate biological objective function while satisfying the mass balance and metabolite exchange constraints. Various commonly used objective functions include maximization of growth and minimization of intracellular flux, among others. In genetically or environmentally perturbed networks, algorithms such as Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment (MoMA) have been reported to better represent the biological observations as they simulate the redistribution of fluxes in a perturbed cell so as to be as similar as possible to the wild-type. However, the mathematical formulation of certain class of problems, such as those using a linear combination of fluxes, has been found to be sensitive to the representation of the reaction stoichiometry. This dependency can lead to contradictory predictions upon a given genetic or environmental perturbation, thus making the biological interpretation subjective and ambiguous. The new method, MiMBl, accounts for reaction stoichiometry in the objective function by mapping the flux space into the metabolite turnover space, thus showing robust predictions independently of the stoichiometry representation. This new formulation has been shown to increase the power for predicting genetic interactions in the metabolic network of S. cerevisiae.
Plague, a virulent and re-emerging disease, affects both humans and rodents, with human cases reported annually, mainly in Africa. Despite its impact, plague ecology in African foci remains poorly studied compared to North American foci. In Madagascar, plague has been endemic since the 1920s, with human seroprevalence levels and cases heterogeneously distributed across the highlands. This spatial variability has been suggested to be related to topographic relief. The black rat, Rattus rattus, is the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar, and its limited home range and low levels of dispersal make it an essential subject for plague spread studies. This summary investigates the role of rat dispersal in plague spread by comparing plague seroprevalence levels and genetic structure of rat populations in four areas of the Madagascan plague focus with different topographic relief profiles. The study aims to determine if plague seroprevalence distribution in rat populations differs between plateau and mountain areas, if the fine-scale genetic structure of rat populations is higher in mountain areas than in plateaus, and how plague distribution relates to the population genetics of R. rattus. Field sampling was carried out systematically, capturing rats from introduced species (house mouse, black rat, and Norway rat), and euthanizing, measuring, and collecting blood and tissue samples for analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped for 15 microsatellite loci. Plague seroprevalence was determined using a rat IgG anti-F1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic diversity, allelic richness, and FIS were assessed for each subpopulation, and effective population size was estimated using a linkage disequilibrium-based method. Relationships between plague seroprevalence and genetic diversity or population size were evaluated using Spearman's rank non-parametric correlation analyses. Bayesian clustering and FST analyses were performed to estimate the number of genetic clusters in each area and assign individuals to the various clusters.
"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting over 200 million people, with 120 million symptomatic and 20 million suffering severe illness. Up to 70 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to this disease. Human schistosomiasis is caused by infection with Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma haematobium, or Schistosoma japonicum. The current control strategy relies on mass drug administration of praziquantel; however, the risk of drug resistance emphasizes the need for an immunoprophylactic anti-schistosomal vaccine.A potential vaccine candidate is the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 (SmLy6) protein family. These proteins, named SmLy6A to SmLy6K, contain one or more uPAR/Ly6 domains, a 60-110 amino acid region that forms a characteristic ""three-fingered protein domain"" fold. SmLy6 proteins share the same core fold with the transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFβR) family and the snake α-neurotoxins family but are differentiated by protein features and cysteine spacing. Human Ly6 proteins are involved in diverse roles such as septate junction formation, odorant response, and limb regeneration. In schistosomes, proteomic analyses have identified two uPAR/Ly6 domain-containing proteins on the surface of the adult, SmCD59a and SmCD59b, and another member within the tegumental fraction. These proteins are not functional orthologs of the human CD59 protein, but part of a larger set of S. mansoni uPAR/Ly6 domain-containing proteins containing seven members with unknown functions.Recent studies have shown that two S. mansoni Ly6 family members, SmLy6A and SmLy6B, elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities, supporting their surface localization. IgG1, IgG4, and IgE responses against SmLy6A and SmLy6B were found to be higher than IgG1 prevalence for a sub-surface tegumental antigen, SmTAL1. Additionally, post-treatment IgG1 levels against surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B significantly drop, while rising IgG1 levels against sub-surface SmTAL1 were observed. Therefore, SmLy6 family members are promising vaccine candidates for schistosomiasis prevention."
The Drosophila retina is a complex tissue made up of various cell types with unique shapes, positions, and neighbor relations. Mechanical forces within cells control these cell shapes and larger-scale organization within tissues. A fundamental issue is whether tissue morphology can be described as the sum of cell morphologies, determined by autonomous force generators, or if it is passively determined by equilibrium mechanics once a small number of force parameters is established by force-generating molecules within cells. The Drosophila retina is a pseudostratified epithelium containing over 800 repeating units called ommatidia, each consisting of twenty cells including eight photoreceptor neurons and twelve accessory cells. Cells in the retina express two kinds of cell-cell adhesion molecules: E-cadherin and N-cadherin. The cadherin protein molecules become localized in a thin band of lateral cell membrane, affecting the adherence of one cell with its neighbor. The binding interactions appear to be homotypic, with E- and N-cadherin molecules not binding to each other. Intermolecular binding collectively generates adhesion between facing membranes, thereby decreasing the interfacial energy per AJ area and making expansion of the interfacial AJ domain energetically favorable. Membrane that has established such bonds is considered “active”. The mechanical energy of the entire ommatidium needs to be minimized globally in order to find an equilibrium configuration for the ommatidium, which describes the entire retinal tissue since ommatidia are arranged in the epithelium as identical tiles with six-fold axes of symmetry. Cell-cell adhesion can play an important role in cell sorting and morphogenesis of tissues. In the Drosophila retina, the role of cadherins goes beyond cell sorting and in fact determines the details of their geometric shapes. In order to understand how cadherin molecules control cell geometry, one must consider the distribution and dynamic properties of cadherins. A computer simulation of the epithelial tissue was created in which the global interfacial energy between cells is minimized, and experimental data for both normal cells and mutant cells either lacking or misexpressing the adhesion protein N-cadherin can be explained by a simple model incorporating salient features of morphogenesis that include the timing of N-cadherin expression in cells and its temporal relationship to the remodeling of cell-cell contacts. The simulations reproduce the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, distinguish features of cadherin dynamics, and emphasize the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. The simulations also indicate that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, thereby modulating adhesion strengths between cells.
MT1-MMP is a membrane protease that plays a central role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by aggressive cancer cells, localizing at membrane protrusions called invadopodia. A continuous supply of MT1-MMP and its rapid turnover are essential for ECM degradation at invadopodia. The turnover rate of MT1-MMP and its contribution to ECM degradation have been examined through FRAP experiments and computational modeling. The FRAP experiments showed rapid recovery of MT1-MMP, approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants of 26 seconds and 259 seconds, which depends primarily on vesicle transport. The computational model, employing the observed kinetics of the FRAP experiments, successfully reproduced the FRAP experiments. Inhibition of vesicle transport blocked ECM degradation experimentally, and the simulation showed no appreciable ECM degradation under conditions inhibiting vesicle transport. The degree of the reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of the reduction in the MT1-MMP turnover. Therefore, the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP is critical for ECM degradation at invadopodia, and the computational model provides a new in silico tool to design and evaluate intervention strategies in cancer cell invasion.
In order to understand how drug-resistant HIV-1 arises and spreads within an infected individual, a study was conducted on four macaques infected with RT-SHIVmne027, a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), and treated with RT inhibitors. Both viral DNA and RNA were isolated from multiple compartments including blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at multiple time points. The resulting sequences revealed a dynamic system in which vRNA rapidly acquires drug resistance concomitantly across compartments through multiple independent mutations. Fast migration results in the same viral genotypes present across compartments, but not so fast as to equilibrate their frequencies immediately. The blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized rarely, while both the blood and lymph node were more frequently different from mucosal tissues. This study suggests that even oft-sampled blood does not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut where vRNA turnover was faster than the plasma and vDNA retained fewer wild-type viruses than other sampled compartments. The findings of transient compartmentalization across multiple tissues may help explain the varied results of previous compartmentalization studies in HIV-1. Understanding the spatial landscape of drug resistance in HIV-1 is crucial for administering current therapy and designing new antiretroviral therapies. Previous studies suggest that HIV-1 drug resistance originates primarily in tissues with low or absent drug concentration, highlighting the importance of improving drug penetration in these tissues. However, nearly all sampling of HIV-1 is done in the blood plasma, and differences between viruses from plasma and tissues could drive misdiagnoses of pre-existing drug-resistant variants, resulting in incorrectly applied therapies and selection for further drug resistance. Therefore, understanding HIV-1 genetic variation across the body might contribute to our understanding of viral reservoirs and the potential for virus eradication.
"Feedback regulation of cell lineage progression is crucial for tissue size homeostasis, but its role in tissue morphogenesis is not well-understood. A study using mathematical modeling shows that a particular feedback architecture with both positive and negative diffusible signals acting on stem and/or progenitor cells can lead to bistable or bimodal growth behaviors, ultrasensitivity to external growth cues, local growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise from the control of stem or progenitor self-renewal and not from regulation of cell cycle speeds. Diffusible molecules, such as morphogens, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, play important roles in solid tissues, including conveying positional information, coordinating proliferation with differentiation, and enabling collective responses to disturbances. However, the importance of diffusible signals in orchestrating the morphogenesis of solid tissues is not well understood. Recent mathematical modeling has suggested that the ability of diffusible molecules to spontaneously create large-scale spatial patterns may drive branching morphogenesis. However, a negative feedback loop that has primarily been studied for its role in size homeostasis of continually self-renewing tissues can also produce steady states that are ""perfectly"" robust, insofar as tissue size is maintained at a set-point independent of initial conditions, cell cycle speed, or rates of cell turnover. This feedback mechanism can also achieve nearly perfectly robust final states for tissues that do not turn over, which is important for the many organs in which cell turnover is non-existent or negligible in the adult. Feedback molecules such as GDF8, GDF11, myostatin, and other renewal-inhibiting factors are often highly expressed during development and can mix with other diffusible molecules that have exactly the opposite effect on stem and progenitor cells, promoting renewal at the expense of differentiation. The simultaneous positive and negative feedback regulation of cell renewal by diffusible signals tends naturally to lead to the spontaneous emergence of spatially dynamic behaviors, which manifest as sharply localized differences in net growth. These phenomena can be used to drive the formation of bulges, buds, and fingers, the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis. Importantly, the patterns that arise are not Turing patterns, but rather are driven by the coupling between tissue growth and the inherent ultrasensitivity of the underlying system."
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the most common eye disorder, affecting tens of millions of individuals worldwide. It is primarily caused by an excessive elongation of the eye, leading to images being focused in front of the retina and resulting in blurred distance vision. A recent genome-wide association study involving 45,771 Europeans aimed to identify the genetic factors associated with myopia. The study identified 22 significant associations with myopia age of onset, 20 of which were novel. These associations pointed towards multiple genetic factors and various mechanisms involved in the development of myopia.The leading cause was a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) in an intron of LAMA2, a gene encoding for laminin, an extracellular structural protein that plays a role in the development and maintenance of different eye structures. Changes in the composition of the sclera's extracellular matrix have been shown to alter the axial length of the eye. Two of the novel associations were in or near genes involved in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the light-sensitive component of photoreceptors. This process, known as the visual cycle of the retina, is crucial for the eye's adaptability to varying light conditions. Additionally, five associated SNPs showed possible links to eye or overall morphology, further emphasizing the multifactorial nature of myopia.Although the study identified several genetic factors associated with myopia age of onset, it was limited by the self-reported nature of the data, potential errors in recall, and the exclusion of non-European populations. Additionally, the study relied solely on age of onset rather than clinical assessments of myopia severity. Future studies should incorporate clinical assessments, broader and more diverse populations, and additional environmental factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex and multifactorial nature of myopia.
The study investigates the impact of different forms of body curvature-based sensory feedback on the steady swimming kinematics and energetics of lampreys, which have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that controls locomotion and adjusts activity based on sensory inputs. The CPG is modeled as chains of coupled oscillators, activating muscles that flex the body and move the lamprey through a fluid environment. The fluid environment is simulated using a full Navier-Stokes model, and curvature serves as input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop. Two forms of feedback are considered: directional feedback, which excites or inhibits oscillators depending on the sign of a chosen gain parameter, and magnitude feedback, which provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators. The study finds that both types of feedback, with the same magnitude of curvature-based feedback on the CPG, can cause distinct differences in swimming performance. This research highlights the importance of sensory feedback in the locomotion of lampreys and suggests that the CPG can generate different responses depending on the type of proprioceptive feedback. This has implications for understanding the neural control of movement in animals and the design of bio-inspired underwater vehicles.
The global pandemic of HIV-1 group M infections, which started about a century ago, is characterized by high molecular diversity and strong founder effects, with most regions being dominated by at most a few subtypes or circulating recombinant forms. The phylogeography of HIV is characterized by compartmentalized local epidemics that are typically dominated by a single subtype, indicating strong founder effects and an advantage of the resident strain that was the first to colonize a population. This effect slows down the invasion of new strains and the diversification of the epidemic. A stochastic modelling framework was developed to simulate HIV epidemics over dynamic contact networks, and the simulations confirmed a strong first comer advantage in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and may influence the future evolution of the pandemic.
The organization of muscle is a multiscale coupling problem, and the study summarized here aimed to understand the role of extracellular boundary conditions in potentiating the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for sarcomeregenesis. The researchers hypothesized that boundary conditions in the extracellular space could potentiate the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for directed sarcomeregenesis. They developed a quantitative model of how the cytoskeleton of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes organizes with respect to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. The results suggest that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton and that a positive feedback loop is required to polarize the contractile cytoskeleton, potentiated by extracellular boundary conditions. The researchers used a computational model of myofibrillar patterning to show the sensitivity of the intracellular architecture to the extracellular space. By comparing experimental results with the computational model, they elucidated the role of maturing myofibrils, their parallel coupling, and their functional attachment to the focal adhesion assembly and how these processes are guided spatially by the boundary conditions imposed on the cell. The researchers concluded that the self-assembly and -organization of the contractile apparatus is facilitated by a symmetry-breaking event that is potentiated by either a geometric cue in the extracellular space or a random event in the intracellular space. The theoretical approach focuses on the interaction between the myofibril and the ECM, as well as adjacent myofibrils. The researchers modeled only the maturation of cytoskeletal structural elements responsible for contraction and integrin binding to the ECM, defining these components using coarse-grained variables that are experimentally observable. The variables used in their approach are: (1) the density of bound and unbound integrin, and, with the bound integrins connected to premyofibrils and nascent myofibrils labeled as and, respectively; (2) the net force exerted on the bound integrin, ; (3) the local density, , orientation, , and the orientational order parameter, , of the premyofibril network and the nascent myofibril network; and (4) the resultant 2D stress field exerted by the cell on the substrate, .
The symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia is being trialed as a biocontrol agent in several countries to reduce dengue transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia causes cytoplasmic incompatibility, has a high rate of maternal transmission, and low fitness costs in the host, making it a promising tool for biocontrol. However, differences in climate, field-release protocols, urbanization level, and human density among the sites where Wolbachia has been deployed have limited comparison and analysis of its invasive potential. A study examining the phenotypic effects of the wMel Wolbachia strain in laboratory Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background found that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission, and no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Additionally, mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro found that the likelihood of Wolbachia invasion varies based on the size of the local mosquito population. Through analysis of laboratory, field, and mathematical data, the study shows that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place. Dengue is a major public health issue, with an estimated 2.5 billion people living at risk of infection worldwide. Control efforts are complicated by the current lack of an effective dengue vaccine, the emergence of insecticide resistance in natural vector populations, and the difficulties and costliness associated with maintaining effective suppression of mosquito breeding sites. Wolbachia-based biocontrol has the potential to ameliorate the burden of dengue.
Histone lysine methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Specifically, histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) plays a crucial role in gene expression involved in plant developmental control and stress adaptation. A study by Sun et al. identified a JmjC domain-containing protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses all three forms of H3K4me in rice. The loss-of-function mutation of the JMJ703 gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant. The crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of JMJ703 revealed a general structural similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD2 proteins that are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However, several specific features were observed in the structure of c-JMJ703, including key residues that interact with cofactors Fe(II) and N-oxalylglycine and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide, which are essential for the demethylase activity in vivo. Overall, this study provides important insights into the resetting mechanism of H3K4me and the regulation of gene expression in rice.
The HIV-1 capsid is crucial in all infectious steps from reverse transcription to integration and is targeted by various host cell and pharmacologic ligands. However, structural studies have been limited to capsid monomers, and the mechanisms by which these ligands influence infection are not well understood. A study identified a multi-subunit interface in CA hexamers that mediates binding to linear epitopes within cellular cofactors NUP153 and CPSF6, competed for by antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand utilizes a shared phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif and binds to a pocket in the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with additional interactions across the NTD:CTD interface to a second monomer. The second interface is conformationally dynamic and accommodates peptides from NUP153 and CPSF6, which have overlapping but unique binding sites. The viral capsid plays a key role in post-entry cofactors, and CPSF6 may act upstream of other nuclear import cofactors and determine their usage. NUP153 has recently been shown to interact directly with viral cores using a similar FG motif. While CPSF6 and NUP153 share a common FG binding motif, their interactions with CA are distinct, and NUP153 has a role in HIV-1 nuclear entry. CPSF6 may also have a role in nuclear import by recruiting TNPO3 to the virus and providing transport to active nuclear pores. PF-3450074 (PF74) and BI-2 interact with the same pocket in the CA NTD as NUP153 and CPSF6, blocking reverse transcription and preventing replication in macrophages. However, complexed crystal structures of intact HIV-1 capsids with ligands provide a molecular basis for their associations with capsid and the resulting effects on HIV-1 infection.
The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a vector for several important human arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya. Its genome is large and repetitive, making it difficult to assemble, with 4,758 scaffolds, few of which have been assigned to a chromosome. To improve the genome assembly and allow the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission, researchers used SNPs in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti to generate a genetic map. This revealed many misassemblies in the current genome, with sequences from different chromosomes found on the same scaffold. After correcting these errors, they were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome. They found very large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres. To illustrate the utility of this new genome assembly, they mapped a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi and generated a list of candidate genes that could be affecting the trait. This improved genome assembly provides a valuable resource for studying the genetic components of vector competence in Ae. aegypti and the development of control techniques.
The mosquito Aedes aegypti, a vector of several viruses including dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, is a significant target of vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional surveillance of Ae. aegypti has relied on periodic household inspections for the presence of larvae-bearing containers, which inform health agents on the most productive breeding sites and trigger control strategies. However, this method faces criticisms such as being costly, dependent on agent effort and householder availability, and providing only qualitative measures of abundance. Traps, on the other hand, offer several advantages over larval surveys. They transfer the searching effort from health agents to mosquitoes, provide qualitative and quantitative indices, and are available in various types that vary in attractiveness, specificity to different mosquito life stages, ease-of-use, and cost. This article compares the standard larval survey and four traps (ovitrap, MosquiTRAP, Adultrap, and BioGent-Sentinel) in five cities representing different climate regimes in Brazil. The study found that traps performed better than the House Index in measuring the seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. The choice between traps should further consider differences of cost and ease-of-use.
APOBEC3G (A3G) is a human protein that inhibits retroviruses and transposable elements by deaminating cytidines to uridines in single-stranded DNA replication intermediates. It contains two cytidine deaminase domains (CDAs), with only the C-terminal one known to mediate cytidine deamination. The N-terminal CDA is enzymatically inactive but is important for oligomerization, which is necessary for A3G's antiviral function. Specifically, tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127 within the N-terminal CDA mediate A3G oligomerization, and this coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. Oligomerization is also RNA-dependent. A3G associates with various cellular RNA molecules, and this association is necessary for its oligomerization, virion packing, and antiviral function. Substitution of arginine residues at positions 24, 30, and 136 within a putative RNA-binding pocket in A3G results in reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization. Overall, these findings suggest that RNA serves as a key regulator of A3G oligomerization, virion packaging, and antiviral function.
The study of the bric-a-brac (bab) locus in D. melanogaster has identified three regions with multiple polymorphisms significantly associated with natural variation in female abdominal pigmentation. These regions include a 15 kb region in the first intron of bab1, an 8 kb region between the bab1 and bab2 coding regions, and a 9.5 kb region near the transcription start site of bab2. Sequence variation surrounding the core cis-regulatory element (CRE) responsible for sex-specific expression in the epidermis of the last three abdominal segments is strongly associated with pigmentation variation, indicating a larger mutational target for functionally relevant mutations than previously thought. A predicted and experimentally verified Polycomb response element (PRE) in the intergenic region between bab1 and bab2, which regulates transcriptional activity over multiple cell generations, also contains significantly associated polymorphisms. The bab2 promoter and transcription start site, traditionally thought of as passive players in transcription, are found to be active in transcriptional regulation and contain significantly associated polymorphisms. These results suggest that not only are promoter regions involved in transcriptional regulation, but that sequence variation in these regions can have a significant impact on gene expression and phenotype. Additionally, the study finds that haplotypes formed by these associated polymorphisms have a large effect on pigmentation, with each region accounting for 20% to 50% of the pigmentation variation. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of QTL alleles and the importance of considering multiple molecular mechanisms and functional elements when studying the genetic architecture of quantitative traits.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a significant human pathogen that primarily resides in the human nasopharynx and causes both invasive and mucosal diseases. The bacterium's genome has significant diversity due to frequent genetic exchange with the surrounding microbial community. This genetic diversity leads to changes in the capsule locus, allowing for host-immune evasion, and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. Pneumococcus utilizes various strategies, including a quorum sensing system and a competence system, to persist in the face of clearance mediated by the host and microbiome. The competence system, controlled by the extracellular accumulation of the competence stimulating peptide pheromone (CSP), activates a regulatory cascade resulting in the upregulation of a number of early competence genes, including an alternative sigma factor. This regulatory cascade culminates in the activation of over 180 genes involved in DNA uptake and genetic recombination. Many genes that encode the antagonistic fratricide effectors are upregulated during competence and target non-competent cells in the population for lysis, releasing genetic material for DNA exchange. Previous work suggested a regulatory connection between the competence regulon and the blp locus, responsible for pneumocin production. This study demonstrates that CSP can trigger the activation of the blp locus in rich media, resulting in increased transformation efficiency in dual culture biofilms through bacteriocin expression. This finding further highlights the adaptability of this pathogen and its ability to enhance DNA exchange and uptake during competence.
The poliovirus IRES-mediated translation requires the functions of certain canonical and non-canonical factors for the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA. The interaction of cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20 in extracts from poliovirus-infected cells has been shown to function synergistically in viral translation. This study further defines the mechanism of ribosome recruitment for the initiation of poliovirus IRES-dependent translation, focusing on the role of the interaction between cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20. The results demonstrate that SRp20 dramatically re-localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of poliovirus-infected neuroblastoma cells during the course of infection and partially co-localizes with PCBP2 in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In extracts from poliovirus-infected cells, SRp20 is associated with PCBP2 bound to poliovirus RNA, indicating that this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. A mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition motif (SRp20ΔRRM) was found to be localized similar to the full-length SRp20, and also partially co-localizes with PCBP2 during poliovirus infection. Expression of this mutated version of SRp20 results in a ∼100 fold decrease in virus yield for poliovirus, possibly via a dominant negative effect. These results support a model in which SRp20 interacts with PCBP2 bound to the viral RNA, and this interaction functions to recruit ribosomes to the viral RNA in a direct or indirect manner, with the participation of additional protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions.
A study was conducted to understand the genetic pathways regulating neural crest (NC) development and to dissect the roles of discrete protein domains in this process. An N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen was used on a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10LacZ/+. Four heritable loci, called modifier of Sox10 expression pattern 1-4 (msp1-4), were identified and mapped, which showed altered NC patterning. msp1, a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, was further characterized and found to carry a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the protein. The ENU-induced mutation was sufficient to impair ERBB3 signaling, leading to impaired NC development and embryonic lethality. This study highlights the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB3 receptor function and activation, and underscores the utility of using an ENU mutagenesis to identify genetic pathways regulating NC development and to dissect the roles of discrete protein domains. NC is a transient population of multipotent stem cells that arises during vertebrate development and gives rise to numerous cell types, including neurons and glia of the peripheral and enteric nervous systems and the melanocytes of the skin and hair. Defects in genes and genetic pathways regulating NC development result in a wide spectrum of developmental disorders, collectively called neurocristopathies. Sox10, a member of the Sox family of transcription factors, is associated with neurocristopathies such as Waardenburg syndrome type II, Waardenburg syndrome type IV, and PCWH syndrome. Mutations in SOX10 have been linked to these syndromes, which are characterized by abnormal pigmentation, hearing loss, and loss of enteric ganglia.
This study investigates risk factors for Schistosoma mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community as part of a longitudinal reinfection study. The study focuses on the influence of age, sex, and ethnic background on susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminth drug treatment, while controlling for cercarial exposure and other environmental and behavioral heterogeneities. The findings suggest that ethnic- and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, while age-related differences in reinfection were linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1, which itself was significantly related to resistance to reinfection. The study highlights the benefit of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings to understand the ecology of a population and make more robust conclusions. Despite control efforts, the estimated worldwide prevalence of schistosomiasis has not changed over the past 50 years, with more than 200 million people currently thought to be infected with Schistosoma spp. Patterns of reinfection in communities that have received curative chemotherapy are never uniform, with some individuals appearing more susceptible to reinfection and others appearing comparably resistant. Studies have observed that water contacts generally decline with age, and gender-related differences in schistosomiasis infection have been attributed to socio-cultural or behavioral factors, but there is evidence that they may also be related to differences in susceptibility to infection. Ethnic differences in infection have been described in many communities and have been mainly ascribed to differences in water contact behavior, but genetic differences may also play a role. Reinfection studies have identified genes associated with relative susceptibility or immunity to infection. This study demonstrates the importance of considering exposure patterns whilst undertaking population-based studies on risk factors for infection and the biology of disease.
A study was conducted to estimate the worm burden of Clonorchis sinensis in humans by counting eggs per gram of feces (EPGs) and comparing it to the actual number of worms collected from 60 residents in an endemic area in Korea. The results showed a positive correlation between EPGs and the number of worms (r=0.681, P<0.001). The worm recovery rates were 9.7% in cases of EPGs 1-1,000 and 73.7% in those of EPGs over 1,000. No worms were detected from egg-negative subjects. The study also estimated that at least 110 worms are infected in a human body with EPGs around 3,000, and egg productivity of a worm per day is around 4,000. Clonorchiasis is a disease caused by infection of C. sinensis and results from ingestion of its metacercariae by consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish. The disease is widespread in East Asia, particularly in China and Korea, and can lead to several pathological changes in the bile duct including cholangiocarcinoma and other complications. Despite these risks, most patients with clonorchiasis complain no or mild non-specific symptoms, making accurate diagnosis and subsequent cure in early stage of infection essential. However, the sensitivity of the worm collection method is too low to apply for diagnosis of clonorchiasis, and it is impossible to figure exact number of infected worms from humans due to limitations in worm collection and EPG counting. Thus, numbers of C. sinensis in the present study were minimum confirmed figures from the infected individuals.
Drug resistance is a significant problem in various fields of medicine, including cancer and infectious diseases, leading to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Combinatorial therapies, which involve using multiple drugs targeting different components of disease networks, have shown promise in treating antimicrobial drug-resistant infections. However, identifying adjunctive targets for these therapies is a major impediment, as most targets have been selected based on previous biological knowledge of drug mode of action and/or mechanisms of resistance, severely constraining the number of proteins that can be targeted.In this study, the researchers performed an unbiased genome-wide screen to identify previously unknown proteins that could be targeted for adjunctive therapy in the context of antimicrobial resistance. They focused on Candida glabrata, a human fungal pathogen with increasing incidence and fluconazole resistance due to gain-of-function mutations in the PDR1 gene. The researchers identified 18 synthetically lethal mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a Candida glabrata PDR1+ gain-of-function allele, one of which was the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5. Deletion or drug-mediated inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles and inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments.This study provides proof of concept that synthetically lethal genetic screens can identify novel candidate proteins that when therapeutically targeted could allow effective treatment of drug-resistant infections. The researchers demonstrated that unbiased genome-wide screens could reveal previously unknown proteins that could be targeted for adjunctive therapy, expanding the potential number of targets for druggable candidates and paving the way for the development of novel therapeutics to combat antimicrobial resistance.
The study of poliovirus (PV) multiplication reveals the presence of membranes containing phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), which appear as vesicular clusters in cross-section. The role of PI4P and membrane remodeling prior to or concurrent with genome replication is not well understood. The study employs two PV mutants, EG and GG, with aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, delaying genome replication and impairing virus assembly. The research indicates that PV induces temporally distinct membranous structures for genome replication (tubules) and virus assembly (vesicular clusters), with the pace of formation, spatiotemporal dynamics, and efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion potentially determined by the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and the capacity for P3 processing to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins. Positive-strand RNA viruses, like PV, pose a significant threat to public health due to their simplicity and evolvability. Establishment of PV infection likely requires multiple genomes entering the cell, possibly through mechanisms like leaving cells in vesicles or attaching to bacterial surface polysaccharides. PV infection wreaks havoc on intracellular membranes, causing dissolution of the Golgi apparatus and forming membranes of unique benefit to the virus. PV-induced membranes often appear as clusters of vesicles, which have been shown to contain viral RNA and proteins. These vesicular clusters arise from tubules induced by viral or viral-hijacked proteins. Early studies of PV-infected cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) documented these changes, while more recent studies using electron tomography suggest that PV-induced membranes arise from tubules. The study also discusses the role of PI4P in PV-induced membranes, which relocalizes from the Golgi to a site between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, and then to the perinuclear region of the cell, localizing with ER markers and viral RNA and proteins.
Chagas disease, prevalent in Latin America and caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions of people worldwide. Current treatments have limitations, including severe side effects and drug resistance, indicating a need for new therapies. Cruzain, a promising drug target, is a cysteine protease enzyme essential for T. cruzi's survival within host cells. This study employed a multi-step cascade strategy using integrated ligand- and target-based virtual screening methods to identify potential cruzain inhibitors from the ZINC database. Twelve non-covalent binding cruzain inhibitors with affinity values in the low micromolar range were found, and their binding mode was confirmed through X-ray crystallographic studies. These inhibitors were also tested against cathepsin L, showing similar affinity values, suggesting their potential for investigating the effect on cell proliferation. Through structure-activity relationship studies, two compounds with trypanocidal activity were identified, with Nequimed42 having a tenfold lower IC50 value than benznidazole, the positive control. A smaller derivative of Nequimed42, Nequimed176, was found to be a novel non-peptidic, non-covalent cruzain inhibitor, making it a candidate for optimization as a trypanocidal agent. Overall, this study highlights the potential of using virtual screening and ligand-based approaches to discover new cruzain inhibitors for Chagas disease treatment.
The yellow fever (YF) virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family, is responsible for causing YF, an infection that results in significant morbidity and mortality in tropical areas worldwide. The only available protection against YF is the attenuated YF virus vaccine, 17D/17DD, which produces both long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and strong T-cell responses. However, this vaccine can have severe side effects that are sometimes fatal. This study investigates the use of non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations to provide an alternative YF vaccine. The two DNA formulations encode the full-length envelope protein (p/YFE) or the full-length envelope protein fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal (pL/YFE) to divert antigen processing/presentation through the major histocompatibility complex II precursor compartments. These DNA constructs were tested in H2b and H2d backgrounds, corresponding to the C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice strains. The results showed that both DNA formulations induced strong T-cell responses and high titers of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies. The pL/YFE formulation performed best and conferred 100% protection against YF virus in intracerebrally challenged mice. Therefore, the pL/YFE DNA is a promising vaccine candidate and should be considered for further development.
Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium responsible for cholera, is naturally found in the marine environment where it forms biofilms on chitin, the second most abundant biopolymer on the planet. Chitin is abundant in the shells of microscopic crustaceans and Vibrio species play an important role in recycling chitin in the aquatic environment. The pathway for degradation and utilization of this carbon and nitrogen source is conserved among the Vibrionaceae. The expression of genes required for chitin degradation, uptake, and utilization are regulated by the orphan sensor kinase ChiS. A recent study found that SlmA, a nucleoid occlusion protein and a member of the TetR family of proteins, is a regulator of chitin utilization by V. cholerae. SlmA binds directly to the chb operon promoter and this interaction is required for transcriptional activation of this locus and for chitobiose utilization. SlmA's DNA-binding function, but not its nucleoid occlusion function, is critical for transcriptional activation. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcriptional regulator in V. cholerae in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor.
The authors present a nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for the scalable solution of parameter estimation problems in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Such problems are computationally challenging due to highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations, multiple experimental data sets, and many parameters. The framework utilizes advanced modeling and solution tools that are computationally efficient, robust, and user-friendly. It uses a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations, enables fully algebraic model implementations and derivative computation, and utilizes computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. The proposed framework is demonstrated to solve a synthetic human gut microbiome community model with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points in less than 3 minutes, whereas an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours. Additionally, the proposed framework can solve problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The framework is flexible, easy-to-use, and can handle sophisticated estimation techniques for quantifying parameter uncertainty, diagnosing observability/uniqueness issues, performing model selection, and handling outliers. Dynamic modeling is essential for understanding biological systems such as microbial communities, gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways. Computational challenges in these problems arise from the dimensionality, nonlinearity, stiffness, incomplete observation, and large number of parameters and data sets. The authors have previously reviewed methods for solving estimation problems with differential equations, including maximum likelihood estimation, simulation-based approaches, and derivative-based and derivative-free search schemes. However, these methods have limitations in terms of computational cost, accuracy, and scalability. The proposed NLP framework addresses these limitations and has been demonstrated to handle large-scale parameter estimation problems for biological models. The framework provides an overview of parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification that leverages state-of-the-art optimization methods and can handle complex features such as unknown initial conditions and non-additive objective functions. The paper includes a detailed explanation of the estimation formulation, NLP solvers, and randomized maximum a posteriori (rMAP) methods for outlier mitigation.
The nCounter, a high throughput digital gene expression system, was used to analyze gene expression changes in multiple tissues of Swiss Webster (SW) mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV) over a nine-day course. The gene expression changes of 179 inflammation-related genes were examined in the spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain of the mice. The results showed that Cxcl10 and Il12b were differentially expressed in all tissues tested except kidney. Data stratification of WNV(+) and WNV(-) tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response from tissue-specific responses arising from WNV infection. Specific gene and protein expression kinetics were found for Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4 and Ccl5 and correlated with the presence of infectious virus. The utility of the nCounter platform for rapid identification of gene expression changes in SW mice associated with WNV infection was demonstrated. WNV is a neurotropic flavivirus endemic to parts of the Americas, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, with humans and animals being potential hosts. While most WNV infections are asymptomatic, a small percentage can develop into severe neurological diseases such as meningitis or encephalitis. There are currently no approved antiviral therapies or vaccines for human use. The number of WNV infections in the US has totaled 37,088 cases, including 16,114 neuroinvasive cases and 1,549 fatalities, since its introduction in 1999. Outbred Swiss mice, such as the SW mice used in this study, have been utilized to demonstrate differences in neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence between naturally occurring and engineered WNV strains, to study molecular determinants of neuroinvasiveness in related lineage 1 WNV strains, and for evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.
In 2014, an outbreak of human rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique, resulting in 14 reported cases and an unreported number of unconfirmed cases. A shortage of reliable data on the burden and risk factors of human rabies in Mozambique has led to underinvestment in control measures. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological profile of animal bites and clinical and epidemiological features of human rabies cases during the outbreak. The study found that the majority of bite victims were children under 15 years old, and most bites occurred in suburban areas where residents have poor access to medical care. Of the 14 human rabies cases, all involved dog bites, and no victims received full post-exposure vaccination. The study found that 819 cases of animal bites were registered during the investigation period, with most bites occurring in people living in suburban areas. Only 30.1% of animal bite victims received post-exposure vaccination. Demographic variables and other known risk factors were compared between cases of animal bites and cases of human rabies to determine predictive variables associated with a higher risk of developing rabies after an animal bite. The study found that age under 15 years, a bite by a stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by an unvaccinated dog, failure to wash the bite site with soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis were all associated with the development of rabies. The study's findings highlight the need for aggressive interventions, including regular canine mass vaccination campaigns, improvement of the provision of vaccines to humans and animals, accompanied by regular campaigns to remove stray dogs, and massive education in communities and primary schools. Weak control measures, including low coverage rates of dog immunization, poor control of stray and unowned dogs, inadequate management of bites, and poor availability of and adherence to post-exposure prophylaxis, are major factors driving rabies outbreaks in Maputo and Matola cities.
A large Utah family with a history of febrile seizures (FS) was found to have a potential mutation in the SCN9A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7. This mutation, p.N641Y, was located in the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II and was not present in 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To establish a functional role for this mutation in seizure susceptibility, researchers introduced the orthologous mutation into the murine Scn9a ortholog using targeted homologous recombination. Homozygous Scn9aN641Y/N641Y mice exhibited significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates. These data support the SCN9A p.N641Y mutation as disease-causing in this family. Further analysis of 92 unrelated FS patients identified additional highly conserved Nav1.7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. After one of these children with FS later developed Dravet syndrome, a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the SCN1A gene was identified. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients yielded nine Nav1.7 missense variants (8% of the patients). Six of these Dravet syndrome patients with SCN9A missense variants also harbored either missense or splice site SCN1A mutations and three had no SCN1A mutations. This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations. FS are the most common seizure disorder of early childhood and occur in up to 75% of children with Dravet syndrome. Children who experience FS have a 2-9% chance of developing afebrile seizures later in life. FS are associated with an increased risk of developing other types of epilepsy, some of which can be resistant to currently available anticonvulsant therapy. This study highlights the importance of further research into the role of SCN9A in human epilepsies.
The study of tissue growth and deformation in biology is crucial to understanding how complex tissue shapes arise, with preferential growth along particular orientations being a key factor. The orientation of this growth can be specified through stresses (axiality-based system) or molecular signalling (polarity-based system). A new polarity-based system, Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, has been developed and applied to a Snapdragon flower, showing that orientations and rates of growth can be specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature. The GPT-framework can be used to understand how genes influence specified growth, which is key to understanding how resultant growth arises. Elements of the stress-based and polarity-based axiality systems have been modelled, and a software implementation of the polarity-based axiality approach, GPT-framework, has been developed. This framework can be used to model tissue growth, with the potential to specify orientation independently of stresses, leading to the generation of complex tissue shapes.
In the early stages of HIV infection, multiple CD8+ T cell responses are elicited, exerting strong selective pressures on different parts of the virus's genome. These pressures result in the selection of mutations that enable the virus to evade recognition, thereby benefiting its survival. The study found that the later these escape mutations emerge, the more slowly they reach fixation. This pattern of escape rate decrease (ERD) can be attributed to distinct mechanisms, including interference among different escape strains in large populations with high beneficial mutation rates. This interference can delay the fixation times of beneficial mutations, leading to a decrease in escape rates. The study found that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern and that the number of loci and recombination rates substantially affect ERD. Additionally, the study found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations and interference effects. Overall, the findings suggest that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations and that accounting for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations demands novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains, rather than mutation frequencies.
The survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is poor, particularly for those in advanced stages, and can be as low as 1%. The successful choice of preoperative chemotherapy for patients with resectable disease is critical to eliminate micrometastasis and improve operability. An in silico experimentation approach has been developed to suggest the optimal treatment protocol for each patient based on their own multiscale data. A determinant for reliable predictions is the a priori estimation of the drugs’ cytotoxic efficacy on cancer cells for a given treatment. A mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment is applied to estimate the cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens. The model incorporates the cancer related mechanism of uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia and treatment resistance. The methodology is based on the provision of tumor volumetric data at two time points, before and after or during treatment. A thorough sensitivity analysis has established the volume growth rate and the growth fraction at diagnosis as key features for more accurate estimates. The methodology is applied on the retrospective data of thirteen patients with NSCLC who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The model is capable of simulating different proliferation patterns based on the assumed conditions of tumor microenvironment and incorporates patient-specific data such as imaging-based, histological, molecular and treatment data. The present work provides a quantitative framework for the estimation of the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies and correlation studies of such estimates with the molecular profile of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
High levels of antibiotic tolerance in bacterial biofilms, characterized by reversible and transient resistance to antibiotics, is a significant concern in healthcare due to the increased tolerance of biofilm-associated bacteria to multiple antibiotics on medical implants. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this antibiotic tolerance are not well understood, but recent studies suggest that the physiological heterogeneity of biofilms and specialized subpopulations within biofilms contribute to this tolerance. A study using Escherichia coli as a model organism identified amino acid auxotroph mutants that exhibited significantly greater tolerance to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in biofilm states than in planktonic states. The biofilm-associated tolerance to ofloxacin was found to be fully dependent on a functional SOS response upon starvation for amino acids and carbon sources, and partially dependent on the stringent response upon leucine starvation. Importantly, the biofilm-specific ofloxacin increased tolerance did not involve any of the SOS-induced toxin–antitoxin systems previously associated with formation of highly tolerant persisters. These findings suggest that the SOS stress response induced in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a molecular mechanism leading to biofilm-specific high tolerance to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind antibiotic tolerance in bacterial biofilms and to develop effective strategies for preventing and treating biofilm-associated infections.
Plasmodium falciparum malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, is responsible for high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis and death associated with this disease are due to parasite-infected erythrocytes. The invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum merozoites requires specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands localized in apical organelles called micronemes. A study identified cAMP as a key regulator that triggers the timely secretion of microneme proteins, enabling receptor-engagement and invasion. Exposure of merozoites to a low potassium environment, typical of blood plasma, activates a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adenylyl cyclase to raise cytosolic cAMP levels and activate protein kinase A, which regulates microneme secretion. Additionally, cAMP activates the Epac pathway, triggering a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ leading to microneme release. The study of these signaling pathways provides novel targets to inhibit blood stage parasite growth and prevent malaria.
The soil-transmitted nematode Strongyloides stercoralis is a commonly overlooked helminth among the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), occurring worldwide except for the far north and south. Its prevalence is often imprecisely estimated due to a lack of information and the limited sensitivity of diagnostic methods. S. stercoralis can reproduce within a human host, leading to long-lasting infections, and can cause systemic infection in immunosuppressed individuals, resulting in hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis, which can be fatal. Uncomplicated intestinal strongyloidiasis may present as gastro-intestinal symptoms, while many infections remain asymptomatic, which can lead to underdiagnosis.A literature review of studies from 1989-2011 revealed a lack of information on S. stercoralis in numerous African, Asian, and South-American resource-poor countries. A Bayesian meta-analysis showed an association between HIV-infection, alcoholism, and S. stercoralis infection. High infection prevalence rates were found in the general population in certain countries and geographical regions. The meta-analysis indicated that S. stercoralis infection is prominent in several risk groups. However, adequate information is still lacking from many countries. The current information emphasizes the need for further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings and the importance of integrating S. stercoralis control into global helminth control.In summary, the nematode S. stercoralis is a widely distributed but often overlooked helminth associated with neglected tropical diseases. Its prevalence is difficult to estimate due to insufficient information and the limitations of diagnostic methods. The worm can cause long-lasting infections and systemic infections in immunosuppressed individuals, making it a significant public health concern. Despite the limited data, the available information indicates that S. stercoralis infection is widespread in various risk groups and regions. Addressing this issue requires further research and incorporating control strategies into global helminth control programs.
This study explores the role of stochastic noise in circadian oscillations and its relevance to circadian therapeutics. Circadian rhythms, which are daily changes in gene expression and physiology, are critical for metabolic health. While cell-to-cell coupling synchronizes rhythms in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, peripheral tissues have weak or no coupling. Cellular-level rhythms are generated by a large network of gene regulatory elements, and the robustness of these oscillations is linked to metabolic health. Bioluminescence-based cellular circadian reporters offer a direct view of the gene regulatory network and are amenable to high-throughput screens. At the single-cell level, transcription is affected by both intrinsic (molecular counts) and extrinsic (cell size, environment) noise, resulting in stochastic bioluminescence traces. While stochastic noise has been suspected to play a significant role in circadian rhythms, measuring it requires careful preparation, recording, and image processing of individual cells. This study demonstrates a method to reliably infer changes in stochastic noise from the changes to the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings of cultured circadian reporters. The method was validated using single-cell fibroblast data, a small-molecule modulator, a mathematical model, and siRNA knockdown data. The authors conclude that circadian rhythms have likely evolved to an optimal point of high amplitude and low stochastic noise and that their method allows the effect of candidate drugs on stochastic noise to be quantified in a high-throughput manner, which is crucial for the development of circadian therapeutics.
The increasing issue of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria has necessitated the development of novel drug-target selection and development approaches. One promising target is the essential bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, which plays a crucial role in bacterial cell division. The allosteric inhibitor PC190723 has demonstrated in vitro activity on Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and in vivo antimicrobial activities. However, the mechanism of drug action and its effect on FtsZ in other bacterial species are unclear. A recent study used PocketFEATURE, a statistical method that scores the similarity between pairs of small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure information about the local microenvironment, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket. The study found that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with substantially disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. MD simulations of an FtsZ dimer also indicated that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding. Thus, the drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states, yielding important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors. PC190723 and its derivatives are promising drug candidates as they have demonstrated inhibitory effects on FtsZ in various Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus. Importantly, PC190723 exhibited antimicrobial properties in vivo in mouse models, suggesting that this small molecule selectively targets bacterial cell division without affecting tubulin, the eukaryotic FtsZ homolog. The co-crystallization of an SaFtsZ-PC190723 complex in two independent studies has confirmed that PC190723 specifically binds to S. aureus FtsZ. However, the exact mechanism of PC19072
Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) is a cellular binding partner of lentiviral integrase (IN) proteins, required for efficient viral replication and specific for lentiviral INs. A crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains of HIV-2 IN in complex with the IN binding domain (IBD) of LEDGF shows primarily charge-charge interactions between the NTD of IN and the IBD. These new structural details enable the engineering of a mutant of HIV-1 IN that primarily functions only when presented with a complementary LEDGF mutant. Retroviral INs, including HIV-1 and HIV-2, share a conserved three domain organization and are involved in the integration of reverse transcribed viral cDNA into the host cell genome. The integration process is catalyzed by IN and involves 3′-processing in the cytoplasm of the host cell and strand transfer in the nucleus, where the viral cDNA nicks and joins to opposing strands of the cellular DNA. The enzyme active site of IN is composed of three invariant acidic residues that coordinate a pair of Mg2+ cations during catalysis. The NTD of IN forms a three-helical bundle and folds around a zinc atom, while the CTD features an SH3-like fold and is likely involved in DNA binding. The CCD of IN spans the most conserved region of IN and bears close structural homology to prokaryotic transposases. The active form of retroviral IN is a tetramer, but the structure of a full-length retroviral IN remains elusive. Lentiviral DNA integration critically depends on LEDGF, which tightly associates with chromatin and has been implicated in regulation of cellular gene expression, epigenetic chromatin modifications, and apoptosis. LEDGF tethers lentiviral IN to host chromatin in the nucleus and plays a critical role in directing PICs to active genes during integration.
A study investigating the evolution of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their impact on tumor progression was conducted using a cellular automaton model. The model tracks the temporal evolution of the malignant subpopulation of CSCs, which are exclusively able to initiate and sustain tumors. The study explores orthogonal cell traits, including cell migration, spontaneous cell death, symmetric cancer stem cell division, and telomere length. The results suggest that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth, with an early increase in proliferation potential yielding larger populations of non-stem cancer cells that compete with CSCs and inhibit CSC division. A reduction in proliferation potential, however, decreases intratumoral competition and enables accelerated CSC pool expansion and further evolution. Additionally, the study found that evolutionary phenotypic heterogeneity leads to unpredictable spatiotemporal distribution of cells with varying aggressiveness, and that the fraction of cancer stem cells in collected biopsy samples can vary by as much as two orders of magnitude. Overall, the study highlights the importance of CSCs in tumor progression and the need for further investigation into the evolution of these cells and their impact on tumor growth.
"The emergence of zoonotic diseases in humans, such as the Spanish flu of 1918 and the SARS outbreak of 2003, poses significant risks to global public health. While previous research has studied the evolution and transmission of these diseases within a homogeneous human host population, factors such as human contact patterns and other forms of host heterogeneity may also shape the risk and speed of emergence events. This study focuses on the heterogeneity in the spatial structure of the human host population, specifically in the context of adapting pathogens.The authors use a model of evolution and emergence in which a zoonotic pathogen infects humans and initially has very poor transmissibility. As the pathogen adapts and becomes more transmissible, it can cause epidemics in human populations. The model considers two routes of adaptation with opposite and distinct characteristics. In the ""punctuated"" scenario, the pathogen acquires genetic changes that increase its ability to pass to other humans, while in the ""gradual"" scenario, the pathogen gradually becomes more transmissible over time.The authors use this model to study the impact of the mutation rate and the average reproductive number of the intermediate strain on the probability of emergence per introduction of the pathogen in a single, infinite population. They find that the probability of emergence grows non-linearly with both the mutation rate and the reproductive number of the intermediate strain. They also find that the model is robust to different types of human movement and that the probability of emergence is largely determined by the biology of the novel pathogen.The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for public health. They suggest that, for plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. They also emphasize the need for further research to understand the impact of human mobility patterns on the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases."
Wild birds, particularly those from the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, have been implicated in the emergence of human and livestock influenza. The role of these birds in spreading influenza viruses has been a concern due to the confounding factors in disease control and surveillance efforts. The patterns of viral spread and the subsequent risk posed by wild bird viruses remain unpredictable, largely due to the lack of knowledge of viral movements between different host populations. In a study, researchers analyzed genomic data from 287 newly sequenced avian influenza A virus samples isolated over a 34-year period of continuous systematic surveillance of North American migratory birds. They used a Bayesian statistical framework to test hypotheses of viral migration, population structure, and patterns of genetic reassortment. The results showed that despite the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay, this host population does not significantly contribute to the North American AIV diversity sampled in Anseriformes. The influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta, on the other hand, are representative of the AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseriformes. The study also found that although AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, the long-term persistence of AIV was independent of bird flyways with migration between populations throughout North America. These findings are vital in developing appropriately informed predictive models critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection.
A novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S139/1, was generated and found to have broad reactivity to multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13. MAb S139/1 showed neutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition activities against specific strains of H1, H2, H3, and H13 subtypes. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb S139/1 had amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193, which are located on the globular head of the HA and form a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain of HA. MAb S139/1 binds to a common antigenic site shared among a variety of HA subtypes and neutralizes viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo by affecting viral attachment to cells. This study supports the notion that cross-reactive antibodies play some roles in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection and highlights the potential therapeutic utility of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza. Neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in protection from influenza virus infection, with most neutralizing antibodies recognizing the HA, the major surface glycoprotein of influenza viruses. The HA of influenza A viruses has been classified into sixteen antigenically distinct subtypes, with considerable amino acid variability in the globular head region among HA subtypes, whereas the structure of the stem region is relatively conserved. However, it is generally believed that the neutralizing antibodies are not broadly cross-reactive among HA subtypes. This study describes the discovery of a cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, MAb S139/1, that reacts with a variety of HA subtypes and inhibits virus binding to sialic acid receptors. The findings suggest the potential of antibodies in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection.
A three-year cohort study of 259 Australian Aboriginals aimed to assess the effect of treatment with ivermectin on the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection and the validity of a lower ELISA cut-off in diagnosis. The study found that treatment with ivermectin was highly effective, resulting in a significant fall in the prevalence of infection. The results suggested that using a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. However, a small group of subjects had persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment. Overall, control of S. stercoralis infection in this cohort appears to be feasible using pharmacological treatment alone. This is significant as S. stercoralis infection is a common and potentially serious public health issue, particularly in underprivileged communities in developed countries. However, there is no consensus on the best measures for controlling the infection, with some advocating for environmental management, while others emphasize the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatment. This study adds to the evidence supporting the use of ivermectin for treating S. stercoralis infection and the potential for using a lower ELISA threshold for diagnosis in certain settings. Further research is needed to determine the optimal measures for control of strongyloides infection in different situations.
Prion diseases are a group of transmissible neurodegenerative diseases affecting animals, including humans, and are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. Prion strains are associated with specific conformations of PrPSc and can interfere with each other, influencing prion strain dynamics and emergence. However, it is unclear if two long-incubation period strains can interfere with each other. A study investigating this found that co-infection of animals with combinations of long-incubation period strains did not result in evidence of strain interference. This lack of interference was not due to a failure to infect common populations of neurons. The study also found that long incubation-period strains contained relatively higher levels of remaining PrPC in PMCA reactions, and the abundance of PrPC is not limiting in vivo or in vitro, allowing prion strains with relatively low prion conversion efficiency to amplify independently. This changes the paradigm of prion strain interactions and has implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.
Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are prevalent in allosteric regulation, and it was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing allosteric coupling. However, a comprehensive ensemble model is proposed to compare the roles of both order-order transition and disorder-order transition in allostery. The model shows that the MWC pathway (order-order transition) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway (disorder-order transition) in allostery, indicating a complicated role of IDPs/IDRs in regulatory proteins. An analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response is also obtained, which shows that too stable or too unstable state is unfavorable to endow allostery, and is thus helpful for rational design of allosteric drugs. This new view of allostery based on the general landscape theory of protein structure highlights the role of ligand binding in stabilizing specific states and shifting the conformational ensemble. The EAM model, which used an ensemble view to explain the allostery of IDPs, provides insight in explaining why IDPs/IDRs are so prevalent in allosteric regulation. However, the pristine EAM model considers only the order-disorder (R-I) transition, but lacks the order-order (R-T) transition as that in the MWC model for the allostery of ordered proteins. Therefore, a comprehensive ensemble model considering both order-disorder and order-order transitions is proposed, which allows for a quantitative evaluation of the role of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation.
Prostate cancer is a major cause of male death in the Western world, but the genetic alterations that drive its initiation and progression are not well understood. One protein that has been implicated in prostate cancer is β-Catenin, which is essential for many developmental processes and has been linked to tumorigenesis in various tissues. However, the role of β-Catenin in human prostate cancer is unclear, with some studies showing increased expression and nuclear localization in late-stage cancer and others showing a loss of nuclear expression in advanced tumors. To further investigate the role of β-Catenin in the prostate, researchers used in vivo genetic studies in the embryo and adult. They found that prostate epithelial β-Catenin is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching, but is dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin controls the number of progenitors in the epithelial buds and regulates a discrete network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. In a model of castration-resistant prostate cancer, deletion of β-Catenin had no effect on disease progression. However, overexpression of β-Catenin in the embryo led to the formation of squamous epithelia, and in the context of Pten loss, it drove progression to invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplasia. These studies suggest that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and has the potential to drive squamous fate differentiation and invasive prostate cancer.Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the developed world and is often driven by the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, the gene rearrangement TMPRSS2-ERG, and the oncogene C-MYC. To better understand the genetic and molecular interactions between these signalling pathways, researchers have investigated genes during embryonic development of the prostate. This approach has identified several genes that are important during both prostate development and tumorigenesis, including Sox9, Hoxb13, and Nkx3.1.The prostate develops from the endodermally derived urogenital sinus in response to androgens that signal through the androgen receptor. This process requires complex epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and involves signalling pathways such as androgens, FGF, and SHH. The buds then elongate, branch, canalize, and undergo cytodifferentiation to become secretory after birth. The adult prostate epithelium is composed of p63-expressing basal cells, AR-positive luminal cells, and rare neuroendocrine cells.The cytoplasmic protein β-Catenin (encoded by the CTNNB1 gene) is crucial in many steps of embryogenesis and is involved in a number of cancers. In the absence of WNT ligand, a destruction complex promotes the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-Catenin via the ubiquitin pathway. However, when WNT ligand binds to the Frizzled/LRP receptor complex, the destruction complex is destabilized, leading to an accumulation of β-Catenin that translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes.In human prostate cancer, CTNNB1 mutations are rare, but β-Catenin expression and localization change during disease progression. In prostate cancer cell lines, β-Catenin enhances androgen-stimulated AR transcriptional activation and increases sensitivity to low levels of androgens and to non-androgen ligands. Nuclear localization of β-Catenin may also result in increased complexes between AR and β-Catenin in prostate cancer cells, changing target gene activation.Mouse models have demonstrated that activating β-Catenin leads to prostate neoplasia and squamous transdifferentiation. Likewise, mouse prostates expressing a stabilized form of β-Catenin in combination with either the SV40 large T-antigen or with a mutated K-ras form invasive carcinoma. PTEN is frequently altered in prostate cancer, with mutations and/or deletions found in 30% of primary cancers and 63% of metastatic prostate tumors. PTEN loss promotes phosphorylation of Akt through PI3K, which in turn phosphorylates multiple targets including GSK3β. Activation of this pathway results in an increase in cell proliferation, cell survival, and protein synthesis. Evidence suggests that β-Catenin can interact with the PI3K/Akt pathway following PTEN loss, through the inactivation of GSK3β and stabilization of β-Catenin.In conclusion, prostate cancer is a complex disease driven by various genetic and molecular interactions. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN and the oncogene β-Catenin play crucial roles in prostate development and tumorigenesis. Understanding the interactions between these pathways may provide novel targets for the treatment of prostate cancer.
A study was conducted to assess factors affecting informed consent in a genetic research study of podoconiosis, a type of elephantiasis, in rural Ethiopia. The study found that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and the techniques of presenting information had significant impact on participants' understanding of the research. Researchers recommended that information sheets and consent forms used in developed countries may not be appropriate for developing countries due to differences in cultural settings, literacy levels, and decision-making norms. Guidelines recommend preceding individual consent with community level consultation and approval, using verbal consent and innovative forms of documenting the individual informed consent process, and providing information about the study at an appropriate level of comprehension. The study found that participants supported the concept of informed consent and valued the respect and politeness shown to them by researchers. However, the information provided must be focused around patients' perspectives and expectations, and other approaches of tailoring the communication style to the local context are essential. The findings from the rapid assessment were used to inform the consent process for the genetic research, including preparing sensitization meetings and conducting community discussions and consultations.
The immune system ensures body integrity through the continuous production of diverse T lymphocytes in the thymus, involving processes of proliferation, differentiation, selection, death, and migration to peripheral tissues where proliferation also occurs upon antigen recognition. A study analyzed the dynamics of proliferation of T lymphocytes across differentiation in the thymus and spleen of mice using single-cell multicolour flow cytometry and a generic mathematical model of state transition. The results revealed that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, with a specific signature that depends on genetic origins, is specific to cell differentiation stages in thymus and spleen, and is altered with age. The model allows inferring proliferation rates and estimating cell cycle durations in sub-populations. The cell division is a common characteristic of biological systems, with variability of rates of proliferation and interphase duration. In the immune system, cell proliferation is essential for the high turnover of diversified lymphocytes that ensures dynamic cognitive function and maintenance of body integrity. The production of T cells occurs through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, selection, and death in the thymus to finally export less than 6% of cells to peripheral tissues as naïve T cells. T cells circulate through the whole organism and interact with environmental and body antigens to proliferate and differentiate into effector/memory T cells upon antigenic recognition. Quantification and interpretation of lymphocyte dynamics remain a challenge in systems immunology. Studies on T cell dynamics at various ages have questioned the mechanisms of thymic involution, followed by immuno-senescence and inflammation with aging, and physiological accumulation of effector/memory peripheral T cell clones, particularly of CD8 phenotype, in both aged humans and mice. Although the number of T cells decreases with aging, promiscuous CD4 T cells accumulate. Thymic hypoplasia or thymectomy in young individuals also affects the repertoire of peripheral T cells and immunocompetence. Thus, thymic production is primordial so as to maintain a homeostatic and dynamic equilibrium in terms of cell populations and repertoires, thereby allowing an effective and adaptive immune surveillance.
A study has been conducted to analyze the effects of a specific mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mouse cells. The mutation, an m. 3739G>A transition in the mitochondrial mt-Ti gene, recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation described in humans. This mutation, similar to the human one, promotes a high frequency of abnormal folding of the tRNAIle that cannot be charged with isoleucine. The cells harboring the mutant mtDNA show a higher ROS production that leads to a compensatory response by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis. This study highlights the different nature of mutations affecting protein-coding genes vs. tRNA genes and demonstrates the positive implication of ROS-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in the expression of mitochondrial tRNA pathological mutations found in human patients. The mechanism may generate an epistatic-like effect by exerting a partial suppression of deleterious mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs, allowing the survival and reproduction of some individuals despite harboring a deleterious allele, thereby facilitating the appearance of a true compensatory mutation.
In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved through X-chromosome inactivation and up-regulation of X-linked genes in both sexes. To determine if X expression is adjusted in response to ploidy, a study examined X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells. The results showed that the X:autosome expression ratio is lower (0.81-0.84) in triploid cells with one active X and higher (1.32-1.4) in triploid cells with two active X's, indicating that X-linked gene expression in triploid cells does not strictly respond to an autosomal factor. An epigenetic mechanism may be responsible for adjusting X-linked gene expression in triploid cells with a single active X. The study also found that a small subset of X-linked genes (~7%) had expression levels proportional to the number of autosomal sets, and that X-linked and/or autosomal gene expression can respond to abnormal genotypes. Overall, the study suggests that X-linked gene expression is up-regulated approximately two-fold in triploid cultures with two active X chromosomes like in diploid cultures, but in triploid cultures with a single active X, X expression is further adjusted further upward, although not tripled. Therefore, global X-linked gene expression does not strictly respond to an autosomal counting factor in triploid cells.
The dN/dS ratio is a widely used measure of natural selection's impact on protein-coding sequences, comparing the rate of substitutions at silent sites (dS), assumed neutral, to the rate of substitutions at non-silent sites (dN), possibly experiencing selection. A dN/dS ratio greater than one implies natural selection promotes changes in the protein sequence, while a ratio less than one implies natural selection suppresses protein changes. This intuitive interpretation is supported by theoretical work. However, the dN/dS ratio was originally developed for the analysis of genetic sequences from divergent species, and its relationship with the underlying selection pressure assumes sequences are sampled from independent, divergent species. Despite this, the dN/dS ratio test is frequently applied to data that may represent samples from a single population, particularly in microbes. In such cases, the differences between sequences do not represent fixation events along independent lineages, but rather polymorphisms segregating in a single population. A study analyzed the population genetics of dN/dS and found that the relationship between selection and dN/dS is qualitatively different for samples drawn from a single population compared to samples from divergent lineages. As a result, standard tests for selection based on dN/dS are extremely sensitive to violation of the assumption of divergent lineages. The expected dN/dS ratio within a population is relatively insensitive to selection pressure, and strong positive selection is expected to produce dN/dS<1 among population samples. Therefore, when applied to intra-specific samples, the standard interpretation of dN/dS is unjustified and may lead to surprising conclusions.
Natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous beliefs. This was demonstrated by studying the correlation between neutral divergence and functional content, as well as between neutral divergence and recombination rate in various species. These correlations persist after accounting for confounding factors such as hypermutable CpG sites, GC content, and biased gene conversion. Coalescent models indicate that even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome. This suggests that natural selection plays a significant role in shaping patterns of genetic variation, including inter-species differences, and has implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.
Phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism for protein stability and activity in circadian clocks across various species. It determines the speed and strength of molecular oscillations by acting on transcriptional activators and their repressors, forming negative feedback loops. In Drosophila, the CK2 kinase phosphorylates and destabilizes the PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins, which inhibit CLOCK (CLK) transcriptional activity. A recent study found that CK2 also targets the CLK activator directly. Downregulating the activity of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 induces CLK degradation, even in the absence of PER and TIM. This indicates that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. Since the CK1 kinase promotes CLK degradation, it suggests that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2. The cyclic regulation of CLK, as opposed to the constitutive expression of CYC, makes the CLK protein the key rhythmic component of the circadian activator in Drosophila. CLK DNA-binding and transcriptional activity show a robust oscillation with an evening peak that is associated with the rapid increase of per and tim mRNA levels. The release of CLK from DNA goes hand in hand with its hyperphosphorylation, which depends on both PER and DBT. Kinase activity of DBT does not seem to be required for hyperphosphorylation, and it is proposed that DBT acts as an interface for the recruitment of other kinases into a complex with CLK. CLK transcriptional activity in cultured cells is affected by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Ubiquitylation is also involved in the regulation of CLK and BMAL1, the CYC ortholog in mammals. In Drosophila, USP8 was recently reported to decrease CLK activity by deubiquitylation. The CK2 kinase has a key function in the clockwork of various organisms. In Neurospora, CK1 and CK2 phosphorylate both the White Collar Complex (WCC) transcriptional activator as well as its inhibitor FREQUENCY (FRQ) to control their activity, subcellular localization, and stability. In mammals, CK2 and CK1 destabilize PER2, although phosphorylation at specific CK2 target sites stabilizes the protein. The CK2 holoenzyme is formed by a tetrameric complex consisting of two catalytic (α) and two interacting regulatory (β) subunits. The β subunits stabilize the α subunits that possess constitutive kinase activity. Phosphorylation of most substrates is enhanced by CK2β, while some substrates are more efficiently phosphorylated by free CK2α in the absence of CK2β. In Drosophila, CK2α and CK2β affect PER and TIM abundance and subcellular localization, which correlates with a direct phosphorylation of both proteins by the CK2 holoenzyme in vitro. The dominant-negative CK2αTik mutation strongly increases TIM stability even in the absence of PER, supporting TIM as the main target of CK2. The CK2αTik protein overexpression induces hyperphosphorylation of TIM that could be explained by enhanced phosphorylation or reduced dephosphorylation of TIM by other kinases and phosphatases. Since the identity of the kinases involved in the control of CLK phosphorylation remains unclear, a study aimed to determine whether CK2 plays a role in the phosphorylation and regulation of CLK. The results indicate that inhibition of CK2α activity strongly increases CLK degradation, whereas CK2β does not affect CLK stability. The CK2 holoenzyme is recruited onto PER, TIM, and CLK mainly during late night, inducing CLK hyperphosphorylation in vivo and CK2 phosphorylates CLK in vitro. Specific CLK activity is increased in dominant-negative CK2αTik-expressing flies indicating repression of CLK by CK2α. The unstable but strongly active CLK acquired by CK2α inhibition joins the club of other circadian transcription factors with similar properties such as the WCC complex in Neurospora.
Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant health issue in Latin America and has become a global concern due to migration. The disease is transmitted through blood-sucking insects from the Reduviidae family. T. cruzi undergoes morphological changes within the insect, including adhering to the midgut and rectal cuticle, dividing, and transforming into metacyclic trypomastigotes before being excreted. Cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase, is a vital virulence factor involved in several steps of T. cruzi's interaction with mammalian cells. Its role in metacyclogenesis and host cell invasion has been demonstrated, and it can cleave all human IgG subclasses. A drug targeting cruzipain, K777, has shown promising results in promoting parasitological cure in mice. Cruzipain is found in all developmental forms and strains of T. cruzi, with varying levels of expression. An endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, chagasin, regulates its activity. Transfectants overexpressing chagasin have reduced cysteine peptidase activity, differentiation capacity, and infectivity. This study investigates the role of cruzipain in the interaction of T. cruzi with the invertebrate host by analyzing the effects of anti-cruzipain antibodies and cysteine peptidase inhibitors on parasite adhesion to the R. prolixus posterior midgut. Results indicate that cruzipain plays a significant role in this interaction, and further research is needed to understand its specific mechanisms.
Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein involved in various cellular processes, such as centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation, and chromosome segregation during mitosis, as well as vesicle transport and organelle positioning during interphase. However, the mechanisms that target and regulate dynein are largely unknown. In a study to identify these mechanisms, a genome-wide RNAi screen was conducted in Caenorhabditis elegans, which identified 20 genes that specifically suppress conditionally lethal C. elegans cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutants. These genes, when reduced in function, are not essential but contribute to dynein function during mitosis. Additionally, some of these genes encode proteins that overlap with those reported by others for the dynein heavy chain in subcellular sites. The study also identified 29 additional genes that, when reduced in function, suppress conditional mutations not only in dynein but also in loci required for unrelated essential processes. Overall, this study highlights the importance of nonessential genes in regulating and mediating essential cellular processes' functions, such as mitosis, through cytoplasmic dynein.
In Paramecium tetraurelia, a unicellular eukaryote, somatic differentiation involves programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) during which physiological DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are repaired to maintain genome integrity. Two types of nuclei exist in the cytoplasm: the somatic macronucleus (MAC) and the germline micronucleus (MIC). The MAC is essential for gene expression and is destroyed at each sexual cycle, while the MIC undergoes meiosis and transmits the germline genome to the new MIC and MAC of the next generation. In Paramecium, PGR in the new developing MAC includes the elimination of two types of germline-specific DNA and the precise excision of thousands of short, non-coding Internal Eliminated Sequences (IES). The excision of an estimated one-third of Paramecium IESs is controlled maternally through a sequence homology-dependent mechanism, and a domesticated piggyBac transposase, PiggyMac (Pgm), is essential for introducing the DNA cleavages that initiate the reaction. The C-NHEJ pathway, specifically the Ligase IV-Xrcc4 complex, mediates the final ligation step during IES excision and is essential for PGR. Two KU70 and three KU80 genes were identified in the somatic genome of P. tetraurelia, and RNA interference revealed that development-specific KU genes are essential for PGR. The Ku70a/Ku80c heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus, and PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage is abolished at IES boundaries in cells depleted for Ku80c, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. PiggyMac and Ku70a/Ku80c co-purify as a complex when overproduced in a heterologous system, indicating that Ku has been integrated in the Paramecium DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR.
Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect both humans and animals. They are caused by the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) to the infectious form (PrPSc), resulting in the accumulation of PrPRes, extensive vacuolation, and microgliosis and astrocytosis. Neuronal dysfunction and synaptic loss have been observed in animal models of prion disease prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. A study using laser capture microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons found that gene expression within these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity. A major cluster of genes is altered during pre-clinical disease, followed by a direct reversal during clinical disease, and this cluster contains a signature highly reminiscent of synaptic NMDA receptor signaling and the activation of neuroprotective pathways. Additionally, genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were altered throughout the disease, culminating in a general decline of gene expression for synaptic proteins. Deregulated miRNAs follow concomitant patterns of expression. These findings suggest that prion replication results in the persistent stimulation of a programmed response that is mediated, at least in part, by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodeling. Manipulation of these early neuroprotective pathways may redress the balance between degeneration and survival, providing a potential inroad for treatment. All animal procedures were approved by the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health - Animal Care Committee or the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with the Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) strain of scrapie and brains were collected at 6 time points post infection (DPI). Brains were processed accordingly for microdissection or pathological analysis. Microdissected CA1 neurons were used to identify numerous genes and miRNAs with altered expression levels in the microdissected CA1 neurons from infected mice. Transcript expression followed a temporally distinct pattern and a bi-phasic molecular response was identified, with a neuronal protective mechanism up-regulated during early prion disease that was subsequently diminished at late stages of infection.
The authors developed an in silico Petri net model to simulate hepatic granuloma development throughout experimental visceral leishmaniasis (EVL) in mice caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The model recapitulated the progression of EVL and many of the changes in cellular composition seen within granulomas over time. Through in silico experiments, the model revealed a previously unappreciated level of inter-granuloma diversity regarding the development of anti-leishmanial activity and suggested that IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells at the core of the granuloma plays a dominant local regulatory role.EVL is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is usually fatal without treatment. Cellular immune mechanisms play an essential role in controlling subclinical infection. T cell-derived cytokines maintain the balance of immunity during subclinical disease, and granulomatous inflammation serves as a histopathologic correlate of protective immunity. The granuloma is a complex structure involving various leukocytes, including monocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, NKT cells, dendritic cells, and, in some cases, neutrophils. In EVL, granuloma formation depends on multiple cytokines, and the elimination of intracellular Leishmania is governed by the balance of cytokines that can activate or deactivate local macrophage anti-leishmanial activity.IL-10 is one of the cytokines with an inhibitory effect on macrophage leishmanicidal activity, and serum IL-10 represents a biomarker of disease severity. IL-10 may operate through direct or indirect pathways, such as inhibiting Nos2 expression in macrophages or regulating effector T cell differentiation and/or activation. Various cell populations, such as macrophages, DCs, CD4+ T cells, and Th1 cells, can produce IL-10. An experimental challenge is determining which of these cellular sources of IL-10 is functionally most potent in the local tissue microenvironment, which cells respond to the IL-10 signals, and how this dynamic balance of immune effector and regulatory function evolves throughout the course of infection. The authors employed an in silico Petri net model to gain a greater insight into the potential importance of macrophage deactivation in regulating the outcome of EVL.The Petri net model faithfully reproduces many of the characteristics of EVL in mice, including the importance of macrophage deactivation mediated through IL-10. The results indicate that local leishmanicidal activity is most strongly influenced through the action of IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells themselves rather than by infiltrating leukocytes. These results provide new insight into how effector mechanisms may be regulated within the granuloma and a new tool to interpret how pharmacologic interventions may operate.
"The paper analyzes the computational capabilities of gene transcriptional regulatory machinery, viewing it as a computational device with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as the output. The authors demonstrate that different parameterizations of a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation can approximate all four standard arithmetic operations, as well as various equality and inequality operations. They analyze the accuracy and precision of these approximations, showing that they depend on different sets of parameters and are thus independently tunable. The authors demonstrate that networks of these ""arithmetic"" genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations. They also consider the problem of approximating analytic functions, showing that this can be achieved by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. These observations are important for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and imply new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks. The authors focus on the general steady-state analog computational capacities of genes, analyzing a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation for a single gene with two transcription factors. They use different choices for the kinetic rates to allow the gene to approximate different binary arithmetic operations, and variations on the model allow alternative implementations of the same functions as well as other functions, such as the square root. They also consider a model of a gene regulated by a single type of transcription factor but having multiple binding sites on the promoter, which can approximate arbitrary analytic functions up to a fixed order based on power series expansions."
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a medically important alphavirus primarily transmitted to humans through Aedes mosquito bites. The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome and can cause fever, joint pain, and various other manifestations including neurological symptoms. CHIKV was first isolated in Tanzania in 1952 and has since spread globally, causing numerous outbreaks. There are three distinct genotypes: West African, East/Central/South African (ECSA), and Asian/Caribbean. The ECSA and Asian/Caribbean genotypes have been responsible for major outbreaks in various human populations. In 2014, the ECSA genotype was introduced in Brazil and spread rapidly throughout the country, with cases also reported in the Caribbean and Haiti. A recent study revealed that the ECSA genotype lineage detected in Brazil was found in both Culex quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus pools in Haiti, suggesting that both Asian/Caribbean and ECSA genotypes would spread and co-circulate in countrywide Brazil.The study in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil, aimed to investigate neurological disorders with a history of arbovirus infection. Patients with neurological disease who reported a previous episode of rash, classical CHIKV symptoms, or fever, myalgia, and joint pain were included. Samples were collected and analyzed for recent arboviral infection by rRT-PCR, employing established protocols for detection of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV viruses. A total of 132 CHIKV cases were identified out of 263 samples initially screened for DENV and ZIKV viruses. However, distinction of CHIKV genotypes was not determined. The present study sequenced the CHIKV genome directly from clinical samples and showed for the first time the presence of two CHIKV genotypes simultaneously circulating in the same region. Moreover, the results show evidence of coinfection of ECSA and Asian/Caribbean CHIKV genotypes in naturally infected human individuals. Molecular clock analysis estimated that the ECSA CHIKV genotypes spread Northwards around mid 2015, concomitantly to its initial detection in the Northeast region of Brazil.
The horizontal acquisition of DNA by bacteria significantly increases genetic diversity, enabling successful colonization of various niches, including the human host. A key issue is how this newly acquired DNA interacts and integrates with the bacterial cell's regulatory networks. The H-NS protein, a global modulator, targets both core genome and horizontally transferred genes (HGT), silencing gene expression in response to external stimuli like osmolarity and temperature. However, H-NS differentiates and differentially modulates core and HGT DNA. For instance, the plasmid R27-encoded H-NS protein selectively silences HGT genes without affecting core genome regulation. This differential regulation of both gene lineages by resident chromosomal H-NS requires a helper protein: the Hha protein. Tight silencing of HGT DNA is accomplished by H-NS-Hha complexes, while core genes are modulated by H-NS homooligomers. The presence of Hha-like proteins is mostly restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have only been found in members of this family. This unique evolutionary feature in enteric bacteria allows them to selectively discriminate between core and HGT DNA, helping maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent form. This feature may provide a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Genome sequencing of different Leishmania species, including L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis, has revealed a high degree of conservation in gene content and synteny across the genus. Only a small number of genes are differentially distributed between these species, and it is not yet known whether these genes are expressed in the disease-promoting intracellular amastigotes or if conserved genes are differentially expressed in the host. However, it has been confirmed that all differentially distributed genes identified by genome comparisons are expressed in intracellular amastigotes, with only a few of these subject to regulation at the RNA level. A large-scale study of gene expression in L. braziliensis found that only ~9% of the genes analyzed are regulated in their RNA expression during the L. braziliensis life cycle, a figure consistent with that observed in other Leishmania species. Comparing amastigote gene expression profiles between species has identified conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host. Host immune competence has been found to influence parasite dissemination, but not parasite RNA expression profiles. These findings suggest that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression at the RNA level. Species-specific parasite factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity in the host may be limited to the products of a small number of differentially distributed genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes, either of which are subject to translational and/or post-translational controls. Infection with species of the kinetoplastid parasite, Leishmania, results in a spectrum of diseases in man, termed the leishmaniases, with the species of infecting parasite playing a defining role in disease type, and the genetic background and immune response of the host also being major factors in determining clinical outcome. Understanding the relative contribution of these different components may enhance our understanding of pathogenicity in the leishmaniases.
Amphimeriasis, a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp, has been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador with a high prevalence in humans and domestic animals. The diagnosis is based on stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but it lacks sensitivity and can be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. A LAMP targeting a sequence of the Amphimerus sp. internal transcribed spacer 2 region was designed and optimized for molecular detection. The LAMPhimerus assay has a detection limit of 1 pg of genomic DNA and has shown a sensitivity of 76.67% and specificity of 80.77% in field testing using 44 human stool samples. The development of this specific and sensitive LAMP assay has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas, but large-scale studies are needed to assess its applicability.
The study finds that the SNARE protein Ykt6 is essential for autophagosomal clearance in Drosophila larval fat cells and is not functionally redundant with Vamp7. Ykt6 and Vamp7, both R SNAREs, interact with HOPS through their longin domains and compete for SNARE complex formation with Syx17 and SNAP29. Ykt6 acts as a non-conventional, regulatory SNARE in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, while Vamp7 is directly involved in membrane fusion. Ykt6 has diverse functions due to its high mobility and can exist in open and closed conformations due to palmitoylation and farnesylation. In contrast, Vamp7 and Sec22 have transmembrane domains and are involved in the Golgi to ER transport pathway and late endosomal-lysosomal fusion events. Ykt6 is known to promote phagophore assembly and autophagosome formation during autophagy, while Vamp7 is involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in metazoans. Overall, the study provides insights into the complex network of SNARE proteins involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are crucial host innate immune defense molecules that target bacterial membranes, disrupting transmembrane potential and causing cytoplasmic leakage, leading to bacterial cell death. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa but is often associated with opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. NTHI has developed mechanisms to resist AMPs, including the Sap (sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides) ABC transporter, which enables NTHI to resist AMPs. The Sap transporter comprises an inner membrane ABC-transporter, previously shown to play a crucial role in defense against AMPs. NTHI SapA, the periplasmic substrate binding protein of the Sap transporter, binds AMPs, and NTHI strains deficient in either SapA or the SapD ATPase are susceptible to killing by recombinant chinchilla β-defensin-1, an orthologue of human β-defensin-3. Here, researchers demonstrated that NTHI lacking the ligand binding protein SapA were directly susceptible to AMP exposure in the mammalian host and that SapA functions to counter AMP lethality during NTHI infection. They discovered a novel mechanism of AMP import into the bacterial cytoplasm, which is dependent upon Sap transporter function. The Sap-permease is required for cytoplasmic localization of AMPs, and in a Sap-permease deletion strain, AMPs accumulate in the bacterial periplasm. Since AMPs are susceptible to intracytoplasmic peptidase activity, AMP import, coupled with cytoplasmic degradation, decreases AMP accumulation in the bacterial periplasm, protecting the bacterium from subsequent perturbation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, a counter strategy to evade innate immune defense and ultimately benefit the bacterium nutritionally.
The utility of active degradation in shaping the coordination of downstream targets by the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA in Escherichia coli was explored through experiments that modified MarA's half-life by knocking down the protease that targets it via CRISPRi or by engineering MarA to protect it from degradation. Results indicated that active degradation could impact both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes could achieve. However, perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist in the context of multi-gene regulation. Active degradation is a rare feature in bacteria, but plays a regulatory role in time-sensitive processes and metabolic processes. Despite its role in regulation across domains of life, active degradation is still comparatively rare in bacteria due to their rapid growth rate. A short half-life protein in bacteria, such as MarA, has a conspicuous presence, leading to the question of what potential utility could necessitate the use of this rare design feature. Therefore, the study focused on MarA, which has a short half-life and controls over 60 downstream targets involved in a variety of antibiotic resistance roles. The stochastic expression of marA creates phenotypic diversity within isogenic populations, which may serve as a bet-hedging strategy. The half-life of the protein impacts the rate of diversity generation and the maximum diversity achieved. Active degradation produces a spectrum of phenotypes where individual cells exhibit a range from low to high expression for all downstream targets. The rate of diversity appearance in downstream genes is impacted by how the upstream regulator changes with time. The study found that longer half-life proteins may be better at generating coordinated diversity in downstream targets; however, this conclusion is dependent on allowing the standard deviation to scale freely with the half-life of the regulatory molecule. The study designed a genetic system to modify the concentration of Lon protease and used CRISPRi to knock down Lon expression, allowing control of the level of MarA. Results showed that the half-life of MarA determines how noise expands in growing microcolonies. The distribution of CFP within microcolonies at the final time step of the experiments highlighted the differences in maximum diversity. The study found that decreasing Lon protease affects the correlation time τ of MarA, as well as the standard deviation of its time trace. The findings are crucial in understanding the role of active degradation and half-life in the regulation of downstream targets.
The study examines the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) in mice infected with Leishmania major, a type of protozoan parasite. MKP-2 deficient mice, unlike their wild-type counterparts, could not control infection with Leishmania mexicana, with increased susceptibility associated with elevated Arginase-1 levels and reduced iNOS activity in macrophages and a diminished TH1 response. However, in the case of L. major infection, MKP-2 deficient mice showed healing responses similar to infected MKP-2+/+ mice. Infected MKP-2−/− mice had a reduced TH1 response, lower parasite-specific serum IgG2b levels, a lower frequency of IFN-γ and TNF-α producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and lower antigen-stimulated spleen cell IFN-γ production than their wild-type counterparts. However, they also had similarly reduced levels of antigen-induced spleen and lymph node cell IL-4 production compared with MKP-2+/+ mice and reduced levels of parasite-specific IgG1 in the serum, indicating a general T cell hypo-responsiveness. Consequently, the overall TH1/TH2 balance was unaltered in MKP-2−/− compared with wild-type mice. Non-stimulated MKP-2−/− macrophages were more permissive to L. major growth than macrophages from MKP-2+/+ mice, but LPS/IFN-γ activation was equally effective at controlling parasite growth in MKP-2−/− and MKP-2+/+ macrophages. Therefore, in the absence of any switch in the TH1/TH2 balance in MKP-2−/− mice, no significant change in disease phenotype was observed. L. major infections are typically controlled by the presence of an antigen-specific type 1 immune response comprising IFN-γ/TNF-α/IL-2 producing CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Susceptibility has been associated with a failure to produce a type-1 response, IL-10 production, or an elevated TH2 response. MKP-2 could have significant effects on L. major infection as these parasites have a well-recognized ability to subvert the development of TH1 responses partly via effects upon MAP kinase signalling. MKP-2−/− mice displayed increased lesion size and parasite burden in L. mexicana infections, but not in L. major infections, due to changes in Arginase-1 and iNOS rather than changes in kinase-mediated signalling. The immune-regulatory mechanisms controlling L. mexicana and L. major differ significantly, and while most mouse strains heal following infection with L. major, the vast majority develop chronic infections following infection with L. mexicana. Thus, while C57BL/6 mice can control L. mexicana lesion growth, they do not cure and MKP-2 deficiency results in progressive disease following L. mexicana infection.
The pancreas is a branched organ with a network of ducts that undergo transitions from unconnected microlumen to interconnected ducts and finally to a treelike structure. The development of the pancreatic network exhibits stereotypic traits and changes over time, becoming more economical and optimized for exocrine product delivery into the duodenum. This process can be broken down into two rules: noisy, redundant duct connection during early stages and pruning of the network based on fluid flux in later stages. These rules are likely applicable to other glands. The pancreatic network has stereotypic traits at each stage of development, and its remodeling can be quantified by standard network measures. The network changes from an overconnected state with multiple paths from a point to the duodenal exit in early stages to a more treelike structure with almost no redundant connections in the mature network. These changes are characterized by a loss of polygonal structures, a shift in clustering coefficient, an increase in network size, and a decrease in cost and network dimension. The pancreatic network structure is stereotypic at each stage and changes systematically as the pancreas matures. The formation of the network can be described by a growth model that starts with a single lumen node and adds new nodes with a Poisson distribution of connections. The assigned links are attached to neighboring nodes drawn from a pool of the closest nodes. The best fit of this model to the in vivo data is achieved when Δ is about 1 and λ = 0.25, indicating that some noise is needed in the number of formed connections between new nodes and where they connect. In the early pancreas, there is no initial phase of stereotyped duct formation followed by less stereotyped processes, as observed in other secreting organs such as the kidney. However, the ductal network of the E12.5 pancreas has an inhomogeneous duct thickness, while the ductal network at E14.5 exhibits some hierarchy of duct diameter. This hierarchy is even more distinct at the E18.5 stage, indicating that duct diameter relates to fluid running through the developing pancreas. The flux-based mechanism for pruning of the network is assessed through an in silico model, which uses already digitized E14.5 pancreatic networks as input. Fluid is added at the terminal ends of the network and drained at the exit to the duodenum, and the network is allowed to reach steady state. The high flux links lie in the inner pancreas structure, and the highest fluxes are found close to the exit of the pancreas. This promotes widening of the ducts and elimination of redundant ducts that carry low or no flow. The network is then pruned from its periphery and progressively toward the center, resulting in a treelike structure. These findings suggest that the development of the pancreatic network is a stereotypic process with quantifiable network measures, and the remodeling of the network can be deconstructed into simple rules. The rules identified for the pancreatic network are likely applicable to other glands and secreting organs. The study of pancreatic network development provides insights into the mechanisms of branching morphogenesis and the formation of branched organs.
Kinesin motor proteins are responsible for intracellular transport along microtubules, and understanding their action at an atomic level is essential. A study used principal component analysis of 114 experimental structures and molecular dynamics simulations to map the structural dynamics of the kinesin motor domain. The analysis revealed three distinct conformational clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5 inhibitor-bound, with unique orientations of functional elements. The conformational groupings did not correlate with the nature of the bound nucleotide but coincided with distinct neck-linker orientations. All three nucleotide states (ATP, ADP, and nucleotide-free) could sample the major crystallographically observed conformations. Simulations showed evidence for a network of dynamic communication between the active site, microtubule-binding interface, and neck-linker via loop7 and loop13. The results indicate that the ATP and ADP-like conformations of kinesin are intrinsically accessible, regardless of nucleotide state, and support a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions. The simulations highlight sites critical for large-scale conformational changes and the allosteric coupling between distal functional sites.
The bacterial Lux system is a gene expression reporter used for high-frequency measurements of gene transcription. Originally developed for bacterial cells, it has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells and whole cell biosensors. The Lux system is fast, sensitive, and non-destructive, allowing for real-time measurements in live animals without the need for euthanasia. However, the interpretation of bioluminescent data can be limited due to the nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. A new mathematical model has been developed to allow for the inference of gene transcription levels from the light output of the Lux system. This model includes the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for all reactions and synthesis and turnover of Lux proteins. The model is calibrated with new experimental data for the LuxAB and Fre reactions from Photorhabdus luminescens, and literature data for LuxEC. The data show clear evidence for previously unreported product inhibition for the LuxAB reaction. Model simulations show that predicted bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output similar to those seen in experimental data. By incorporating the calibrated model into a Bayesian inference scheme, promoter activity can be reverse engineered from the bioluminescence. This approach could benefit all users of Lux technology.
The major cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA1
The humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by the serpin-family inhibitor, Necrotic. Necrotic controls a proteolytic cascade that activates the innate immune response. The serpin is synthesized in the fat-body and degraded in two groups of giant cells, the garland and pericardial athrocytes. Necrotic uptake in these cells responds rapidly to infection and is processed through multi-vesicular bodies to the lysosome, where it co-localises with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. Knockdown of the 6 Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family with dsRNA identifies LpR1 as an enhancer of the immune response, responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin. The removal of serpin/proteinase complexes is a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades in both insects and mammals. The Lipophorin Receptors, LpR1 and LpR2, are involved in Nec processing, with LpR1 being the Nec trafficking receptor, responsible for Nec uptake. Disorders in serpin metabolism, such as the serpinopathies, are associated with failure to clear inert serpin polymers and homologous mutations in Necrotic similarly form inactive polymers.
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the establishment of left-right (LR) asymmetry is crucial for the consistent left-sided placement of internal organs. While the nodal signaling pathway is known to play a key role in LR asymmetry, the opposing pathway has not been clearly identified. In sea urchins, a new study has revealed that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development and the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during LR axis establishment. BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, and is required for activating the expression of left-sided genes and the formation of left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. This suggests that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of LR asymmetry in sea urchins and provide insights into the evolution of LR asymmetry in animals.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread human pathogen that can cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals and neonates. Lytic replication of HCMV starts with the onset of viral immediate early (IE) gene expression, while in latently infected cells, MIE gene transcription is silenced. The cell cycle state at the onset of infection determines whether viral gene expression is initiated or not, with G0/G1 cells supporting IE gene expression and S/G2 phase cells effectively blocking IE gene expression. This block can be overcome by both genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, pointing to the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways in controlling IE gene repression. Checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression strictly requires p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21, suggesting a pivotal role for CDKs in controlling IE gene repression. CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 (NT2) cells, indicating a timely block to CDK activity that secures phase specificity of the cell cycle-dependent HCMV IE gene expression program and prevents the establishment of a latent-like state.
HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) effectively control HIV-1 replication through highly functional HIV-1-specific T cell responses, but the mechanisms underlying the development of these effective T cell responses are unclear. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in priming and expanding HIV-1-specific T cells; however, HIV-1 can avoid intracellular immune recognition in DCs in most individuals. A recent study found that exposure of EC's conventional DCs (cDCs) to HIV-1 leads to a rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of interferon-stimulated effector genes. This cell-intrinsic immune response was associated with reduced induction of SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75, and an accumulation of viral reverse transcripts. Importantly, improved cell-intrinsic immune recognition of HIV-1 in cDCs from EC translated into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. These data suggest that cell-intrinsic type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells is crucial for the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, which could be helpful for eliciting functional T cell immunity against HIV-1 for preventative or therapeutic clinical purposes. Human cells have the ability to respond to viral infections through cell-intrinsic immune responses that lead to secretion of type I interferons and upregulation of a wide panel of IFN-stimulated genes with antiviral effector functions. However, early reports suggested that human cells are unable to mount such immune responses against HIV-1. Recent discoveries have shown that human cDCs are generally capable of generating IFN-I responses to HIV-1, but HIV-1 seems to be able to escape from such cell-intrinsic immunity in most patients. A dominant mechanism that may allow HIV-1 to avoid cell-intrinsic immune responses in cDCs includes the expression of SAMHD1, a host protein that can block HIV-1 reverse transcription by hydrolyzing dNTPs or inhibit HIV-1 RNA through direct degradation. In the presence of experimental SAMHD1 knockdown, viral replication in host cells progresses beyond the level of reverse transcription, and viral reverse transcripts or proteins can be sensed by host molecules that can initiate secretion of type I interferons. Restriction of HIV-1 replication by SAMHD1 may paradoxically benefit the virus more than the host, which likely explains why SAMHD1 represents the only effective HIV-1 restriction factor that HIV-1 does not neutralize through the activity of accessory proteins. Together, these results suggest previously unrecognized innate mechanisms of HIV-1 immune recognition that contribute to T cell-mediated immune control of HIV-1.
Obesity has a strong genetic component, and while few genes that predispose to obesity are known, it's been shown that obesity has a high heritability rate. Genetic screens in invertebrates have the potential to identify genes and pathways that regulate the levels of stored fat, many of which are likely to be conserved in humans. To facilitate such screens, a simple buoyancy-based screening method for identifying mutant Drosophila larvae with increased levels of stored fat has been developed. This method has been used to identify 66 genes that when mutated increase organismal fat levels. One of these genes is a sirtuin family member, Sir2, which regulates the storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by deacetylating key regulatory proteins. Knockdown of Sir2 in the larval fat body results in increased fat levels, and Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner. Surprisingly, Sir2 mutant larvae survive better than wild type under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided, indicating a Sir2-mediated pathway that activates a catabolic response to amino-acid starvation irrespective of the sugar content of the diet.In summary, a screening method for genes that regulate fat storage in Drosophila larvae has been developed and used to identify 66 genes, one of which is a sirtuin family member, Sir2, which regulates fat storage and metabolism in the fat body. These findings have the potential to shed light on the regulation of fat storage and utilization in the context of a growing organism and the potential to uncover pathways that are of relevance to the regulation of a tissue that is specialized for energy storage.
A study of the first embryonic divisions of 42 nematode species, including 27 closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, revealed large intra- and inter-species variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters such as spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. These parameters changed frequently during evolution with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, indicating that asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift. Although all species underwent an asymmetric cell division, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently, revealing previously unrecognized evolutionary changes in spindle mechanics. The findings demonstrate that while the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved during nematode evolution, the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways, and asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift. These results provide a powerful resource to investigate other evolutionary aspects of cell and developmental processes.
The evolution of new gene networks plays a crucial role in the ability of bacteria to adapt to new environments, including pathogenic interactions with host organisms. A key example is the archetypal DNA binding protein, OmpR, which is identical in Salmonella Typhimurium serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, but has undergone regulatory specialization. This has resulted in different environmental triggers of OmpR expression and largely divergent OmpR regulons in the two species. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium overlaps that of E. coli at only 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes, including virulence genes, that E. coli does not have. OmpR binds to its genomic targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S. Typhimurium as a result of acid stress and is required for optimal expression of its virulence genes. The ability of OmpR to recruit additional genes to its regulon is facilitated by its modest requirements for specificity in its DNA targets and its preference for relaxed DNA, which allows it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress. The relationship between a given regulatory protein and its target genes is subject to evolutionary change, allowing genes to join or leave a given regulon over time. This regulatory flexibility is demonstrated by comparisons of orthologous regulators and their regulons from related bacterial species, and can occur through changes in the presence/absence and distribution of binding sites for a common regulatory protein at orthologous targets, acquisition of genes via lateral transfer, architectural adjustment of a promoter under the control of a regulator, or changes that affect the DNA binding protein itself. The OmpR DNA binding protein of Gram-negative bacteria is able to govern collectives of genes whose membership is subject to change, due to its demonstration of only moderate specificity for its DNA targets, allowing new binding sites to arise de novo in relatively few mutagenic steps. Its potential to respond to more than one environmental signal gives it the potential to participate in regulon evolution from the standpoint of regulatory signal reception. Its activity is under allosteric control through phosphorylation by the EnvZ sensor kinase and the OmpR/EnvZ regulatory cascade is an important component of the osmotic stress response system of E. coli. However, OmpR is also sensitive to allosteric effects acting through its DNA target, and binds best to DNA that has adopted a relaxed topology, both in vivo and in vitro. OmpR plays an important role in infection and ompR knockout mutants are attenuated for virulence in mice. In S. Typhimurium, OmpR regulates the transcription of a number of horizontally acquired genes that are not present in E. coli and are key to S. Typhimurium virulence. These include the hilC and hilD regulatory genes in the SPI-1 pathogenicity island, a 40-kb genetic element that encodes a type III secretion system and effector proteins required for invasion of mammalian cells, and the ssrA and ssrB genes of the 40-kb SPI-2 pathogenicity island. OmpR also regulates the transcription of the ssrA and ssrB genes of the 40-kb SPI-2 pathogenicity island, which encodes a two-component system consisting of the sensor kinase (SsrA) and cognate DNA binding protein (SsrB) that regulates the expression of a type III secretion/effector protein system required for intracellular survival and replication of S. Typhimurium inside the acidified vacuolar compartment. DNA relaxation is required for adaptation to the vacuole and OmpR has been shown to enhance the binding to its targets throughout the genome in response to acid stress. Both ompR mRNA and OmpR protein levels are elevated in S. Typhimurium in response to acid pH, but not in E. coli, due to species-specific differences in the regulatory regions of the ompB operon.
In the study of the genome of the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, a SET domain containing protein was found to be secreted via a type III secretion mechanism and translocated to the host cell nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. This protein, named NUE, was demonstrated to be a histone methyltransferase that targets histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself, with automethylation enhancing its enzymatic activity. The bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for significant diseases in humans, including sexually transmitted infections and blindness. It has a specific biphasic developmental cycle and encodes a type three secretion system for translocating proteins across host membranes. NUE is the first bacterial effector found to target mammalian histones. The identification of NUE as a histone methyltransferase provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Chlamydia manipulates host cells and contributes to its pathogenesis.
The height of individuals is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with 80-90% of variation in height attributed to genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many common additive variants affecting human height, but little attention has been given to the potential role of recessive genetic effects. This study aimed to investigate genome-wide recessive effects on height by analyzing inbreeding depression in over 35,000 people from 21 different population samples. The results showed a highly significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity, equivalent to a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared to the offspring of unrelated individuals. However, there was a high degree of heterogeneity among populations, indicating that the effect size differed significantly among populations. This study suggests that multiple rare recessive variants influence human height. The methodology used in this study can be applied to other heritable quantitative traits (QT) of biomedical importance, providing a way to investigate inbreeding effects and the genetic architecture of QT.
Malaria infections induce discrete monocyte (MO) subpopulations with distinct phenotypes and functions, which can change dramatically during inflammatory states. A study of patients with acute uncomplicated malaria and healthy malaria-exposed individuals revealed that at the time of admission, the percentages and absolute numbers of CD16+ MO and CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO were high in a majority of patients. Furthermore, the expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 on the CD14hi MO subset defined two subgroups of patients that differed significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth through the Antibody-Dependent Cellular Inhibition (ADCI) mechanism. The first group, with the highest percentages and absolute numbers of CD14hiCCR2+CX3CR1+ MO and the highest mean levels of ADCI activity, had lower blood parasitemias (0.14±0.34%) than the second group (1.30±3.34%; p=0.0053). These results suggest that during a malaria attack, some patients' MO can exert a strong ADCI activity, indicating discrete MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity. This discovery brings new insights into the complex relationships between the phenotype and the functional activity of blood MO from patients and healthy malaria-exposed individuals.
The study focused on the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on HIV prevalence in humans and SHIV incidence in primate models. The researchers hypothesized that immune activation from this gastrointestinal mucosa infection would increase HIV-susceptible CD4 T cell subsets in the blood and the foreskin through common mucosal homing. The study involved 34 HIV-uninfected Ugandan men who volunteered for elective circumcision, with 12 definitively positive for S. mansoni eggs in stool and 12 definitively negative for both S. mansoni eggs and worm antigen. The researchers analyzed tissue and blood T cell subsets using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.The study found that S. mansoni infection was associated with an increased frequency of systemic Th1, Th17, and Th22 cell subsets in the blood, with these cells demonstrating enhanced function. However, these immune alterations were not observed in foreskin tissue. The results suggest that S. mansoni induced changes in T cell immunology mediated through the common mucosal immune system are not likely to increase HIV susceptibility in the foreskin. Despite the potential association between S. mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility, the study did not find any changes in the foreskin, a major site of HIV acquisition in uncircumcised heterosexual men.The study also highlighted the ongoing HIV public health crisis, with 2.3 million new infections and 1.6 million HIV-related deaths in 2013, most of which occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. The researchers emphasized the need for further studies to understand the role of mucosal immune activation in HIV transmission, particularly in the context of infections of the gastrointestinal mucosa such as helminthic infections.
Filarial nematodes have a mutualistic relationship with Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacteria. Depletion of Wolbachia through antibiotic treatment leads to profound defects in nematode development, fertility, and viability, making it a promising approach for treating filarial diseases. However, the basis for this mutualistic relationship is not well understood. A study using whole mount confocal microscopy found that an immediate response to Wolbachia depletion is extensive apoptosis in the adult germline and in the somatic cells of embryos, microfilariae, and fourth-stage larvae (L4). The induction of apoptosis is non-cell autonomous and suggests the involvement of factors originating from Wolbachia in the hypodermal chords. These observations provide a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes. Morphological defects in somatic tissues and in the germline, based on DNA and actin staining, were investigated in filarial nematodes following Wolbachia depletion. Numerous pyknotic nuclei were observed throughout the ovaries and uteri in the female germline through to the later stages of embryogenesis and ‘stretched’ microfilariae in treated worms. Most of the intrauterine ‘stretched’ microfilariae that resulted from a completed embryogenesis showed morphological defects such as abnormal muscle quadrants associated with pyknotic nuclei. Since pyknosis is a hallmark of cell death, the next step was to determine whether the depletion of Wolbachia induced apoptosis as detected using the TUNEL assay. The germline in ovaries and the embryos in the uterus were examined and the proportion of each stage undergoing apoptosis was quantified. In non-treated females, apoptosis at the level of germline nuclei is a rare event, while apoptotic nuclei were widely detected as patches in the ovaries of treated females. Apoptotic nuclei became more numerous as the uteri filled with embryos in treated females, while no abnormal apoptosis was detected in the control non-treated females. In embryos, a few cells were TUNEL positive in the untreated control samples. This apoptosis is likely to be developmentally programmed. In Caenorhabditis elegans, where it is well characterized, about 12% of the total adult somatic cells undergo programmed cell death during development. In contrast, the majority of the blastomeres of TUNEL-positive embryos from treated females were apoptotic (53%). The intrauterine ‘stretched’ microfilariae extracted from the proximal uteri were also examined. No apoptosis was detected in the control samples, whereas most of the ‘stretched’ microfilariae from treated females were entirely undergoing apoptosis (83%). Apoptosis appeared to be cumulative, with more and more embryos affected as development progresses.
A study on the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has identified that the blood stage of the parasite requires pantothenate for proliferation, which it converts into coenzyme A (CoA) via five enzymes, with the first being a pantothenate kinase (PfPanK). Researchers have found that parasites subjected to pantothenate analogues such as pantothenol and CJ-15, 801 become resistant to these analogues due to mutations in the Pfpank1 gene, indicating that Pfpank1 codes for a functional PanK that is essential for normal growth. The parasites exhibited different sensitivity profiles to recently-described, potent, antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, suggesting different mechanisms of action for various pantothenate analogues. The antimalarial drug-discovery pipeline is currently reliant on a few known drug targets, and the probability of successfully producing a new blood-stage medicine remains low. Therefore, identifying new classes of antimalarials is necessary to manage the threat of parasite drug resistance. The CoA biosynthetic pathway has garnered recent interest for drug-development, and efforts are being made to identify the exact identity of each of the putative genes in this pathway.
A genome-wide association study was conducted on four cohorts of African American individuals to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration, which reflects atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time and provides important information about arrhythmia risk. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray and imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. A strong signal (rs3922844) was observed within the SCN5A gene, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel, with genome-wide significant association (p<2.5×10−8) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. This SNP was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size. Further meta-analysis identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5 that were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian GWA studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one but not the other three cohorts. These findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.
The Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that replicates its genomic RNA in replication complexes formed on intracellular membranes. Previous studies have shown that a host seven-pass transmembrane protein TOM1 is necessary for efficient ToMV multiplication. In this study, it was found that a small GTP-binding protein ARL8, along with TOM1, is co-purified with a FLAG epitope-tagged ToMV 180K replication protein from solubilized membranes of ToMV-infected tobacco cells. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ARL8 consists of four family members and simultaneous mutations in two specific ARL8 genes completely inhibited tobamovirus multiplication. In an in vitro ToMV RNA translation-replication system, the lack of either TOM1 or ARL8 proteins inhibited the production of replicative-form RNA, indicating that TOM1 and ARL8 are required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis. These results suggest that TOM1 and ARL8 are components of ToMV RNA replication complexes and play crucial roles in a process toward activation of the replication proteins' RNA synthesizing and capping functions.Many positive-strand RNA viruses, including Tomato mosaic virus, are dependent on host factors for their multiplication. These host factors include molecular chaperones, HSP70, HSP40, HSP90, cyclophilin B, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, reticulon homology proteins, and endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins. The lipid composition of the membranes is also important for RNA replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.The genome of a tobamovirus is a non-segmented, single-stranded, 5'-capped RNA of 6.4 kilobases that encodes a replication protein of approximately 130 kDa, a cell-to-cell movement protein, and a coat protein. The replication protein is a multifunctional protein that participates in RNA replication and RNA silencing suppression. A fraction of the replication protein co-translationally binds to the genomic RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex, which is targeted to membrane surfaces to form viral replication complexes. The negative-strand RNA is synthesized only after the ribonucleoprotein complex binds to membranes and kept sequestered in the replication complex. Another fraction of the replication protein that stays in the cytosol participates in RNA silencing suppression by binding to double-stranded small RNAs.In tobamovirus multiplication, several host factors including eEF1A, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, TOM1, and TOM2A have been suggested to participate. TOM1 and TOM2A encode seven-pass and four-pass transmembrane proteins, respectively. In A. thaliana, simultaneous inactivation of TOM1 and its paralog TOM3 results in complete inhibition of multiplication of both TMV-Cg and ToMV, whereas knockout of TOM2A and its related genes results in incomplete inhibition of TMV-Cg multiplication but had little effect on ToMV multiplication. TOM1 interacts with tobamoviral helicase domain polypeptides and TOM2A and is thought to help tether tobamovirus replication proteins on membranes. To understand the roles of these host factors in tobamovirus multiplication and to further identify novel host factor genes, especially those that are difficult to identify through genetic approaches, experimental systems have been developed. These include a translation and replication system for tobamovirus RNA in evacuolated plant cell extract and a method to prepare and purify active tobamovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.In conclusion, the Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and many other positive-strand RNA viruses are dependent on both viral replication proteins and host factors for their multiplication. The lipid composition of the membranes, molecular chaperones, HSP70, HSP40, HSP90, cyclophilin B, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, reticulon homology proteins, and endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins are some of the host factors that have been identified to play a role in the RNA replication of positive-strand RNA viruses. Understanding the interactions between viral replication proteins and host factors is crucial for the development of antiviral therapies.
In the locust olfactory system, inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons. Two basic motifs of inhibition are commonly found in neuronal circuits: feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB). A study using a model of the locust olfactory system found that both FF and FB inhibition could maintain sparse Kenyon cell (KC) responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with data recorded in vivo. These findings suggest that the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN) is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs. A better understanding of how inhibitory motifs impact postsynaptic neuronal activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks. Inhibition is prevalent in both invertebrate and vertebrate neural networks and serves many different functions throughout the central nervous system. FB and FF inhibition co-exist in the honeybee and mammal MB, with FF inhibition producing transient early-onset inhibition and FB inhibition producing late-onset inhibition. FB inhibition is tied to odor memory in many insects, and sparse codes, which are based on a few stimulus-elicited spikes in a small subset of neurons, are thought to be important for learning and memory. When synaptic inhibition is blocked in the fly and locust, the sparseness of the odor response in the MB decreases, causing an increase in inter-odor response correlation and preventing insects from discriminating similar odors. Inhibition in the MB changes with learning, and the FB inhibitory circuit is important for labile memory but not long-term memory.
The diagnosis of lyssavirus infections, including rabies, in animals and humans is based on laboratory confirmation, with post-mortem techniques such as direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation still in use. However, molecular techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods have become increasingly important and are now the principal tools for diagnosing rabies in humans and for epidemiological analyses. A dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (combo RT-qPCR) method for pan-lyssavirus detection has been developed, utilizing probe-based (TaqMan) and intercalating dye (SYBR Green) technologies for detecting RABV species and other lyssavirus species, respectively. This method was evaluated using a large panel of primary animal samples representing the genetic variability of lyssaviruses and was found to be sensitive and specific, confirming the sensitivity of skin biopsy and saliva samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. The method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries, demonstrating its potential as a useful and validated tool for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. Rabies is a fatal form of acute progressive encephalomyelitis, transmitted to humans through the bites or scratches of rabid animals, and is caused primarily by Rabies virus (RABV). Thirteen other species of the genus Lyssavirus have been identified, with most being isolated from bats, suggesting a potential origin of lyssaviruses in Chiroptera. In animals, rabies is diagnosed post-mortem using the fluorescent antibody test, while molecular methods have been developed for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies, although none can deal with the full diversity of the Lyssavirus genus. A one-step pan-lyssavirus detection technique, based on a dual combined real-time reverse-transcription PCR (combo RT-qPCR) assay, has been developed and was found to have high sensitivity and specificity, demonstrating its potential utility for rabies diagnosis and surveillance.
In 2007, an outbreak of trypanosomiasis transmitted by tsetse flies caused more than 50% losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A control trial was conducted from May 4th to October 10th, 2007, to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito fences to control tsetse. The study was conducted in two villages, one serving as a control with 14 pigsties and one experimental village with 24 pigsties protected with insecticide-treated fences. The results showed a reduction of more than 90% in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. In contrast, the tsetse population in the control village was not affected. Fifty pigs from each village were treated with diminazene aceturate, and the trypanosome prevalence decreased from 76% to 16% in protected pigs and from 84% to 60% in control pigs three months after intervention. Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomoses affect 20 of the world's 25 poorest countries, and the disease risks and poverty have not been reduced over the last 30-40 years in rural West Africa. The lack of funding and complexity of control efforts, particularly in vast rainforest areas, may lead to slower progress than anticipated. Therefore, improving food security and income of resource-poor farmers in these areas needs to be addressed urgently. Protecting valuable livestock with insecticide-treated nets significantly reduces the risk of vector-borne diseases, as shown in Western Kenya. The intervention in Ghana was based on the hypothesis that surrounding pigsties with ITN would result in a reduction of tsetse flies and subsequently reduce the risk of trypanosome infections. The study results show that the protection of pigs with ITN significantly reduced tsetse fly numbers and subsequently trypanosome prevalence. However, further studies are required to evaluate the effects of ITN on mosquito populations and other insects of medical importance. ITN could offer an attractive, user-friendly, and affordable alternative to existing control methods, providing a private good with a public good character.
A study was conducted to assess the current status of reproducibility and transparency in biomedical journal articles by examining a random sample of 441 articles published between 2000-2014. The study found that there is a lack of reproducibility and transparency in these articles, with only one study providing a full protocol and none making all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. The study also found that articles published in journals in the clinical medicine category were less likely to include information on funding and more likely to have private funding compared to articles in other fields. This study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving these indicators in the scientific literature. The inability to replicate published research has been a concern in the scientific community, and it has been suggested that the lack of research transparency is a contributing factor. This study aimed to assess the current status of reproducibility and transparency in biomedical journal articles and to derive empirical data on indicators such as the proportion of studies sharing protocols and raw data, undergoing rigorous independent replication and reproducibility checks, and reporting conflicts of interest and sources of public and/or private funding.
"The bacterium Yersinia pestis, known to have caused three major pandemics including the deadly Black Death of the Middle Ages, can lead to primary pneumonic plague if transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets. This is the deadliest manifestation of Y. pestis infection, with mortality rates approaching 100% within a week of infection. Using a mouse intranasal infection model, researchers found that the primary pneumonic plague syndrome progresses in two phases: an initial ""pre-inflammatory phase"" characterized by rapid bacterial replication in the lung in the absence of host innate immune responses, followed by a ""pro-inflammatory"" phase marked by extensive neutrophil influx, a massive pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, and considerable tissue destruction within the lung. To identify the host cells targeted by Y. pestis during primary pneumonic plague, researchers used fully virulent Y. pestis CO92 expressing a YopE-TEM β-lactamase protein. They found that the Y. pestis T3SS primarily targets macrophages and neutrophils early during the pre-inflammatory phase of disease. Neutrophils are ultimately responsible for the severe necrotizing pneumonia during the pro-inflammatory disease phase. This work is the first identification and evaluation of the host cells targeted by fully virulent Y. pestis in the lung, and the results give insight into the dynamic events occurring shortly after pulmonary exposure to the highly lethal pathogen Y. pestis."
This study, conducted in Brazil, aimed to evaluate the performance of serology in identifying asymptomatic Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) infection, using a cohort followed for two years. The study included 136 participants, of which 97 were positive and 39 negative for L. infantum infection, and 22 healthy controls. Two molecular biology techniques and three serological tests were performed. The molecular techniques confirmed the presence of Leishmania in all kala-azar patients and in 86% of the cohort participants. However, asymptomatic individuals presented low reactivity against antigens, leading to misclassification bias in population studies. The L. amazonensis and L. infantum antigens showed higher sensitivity than rK39, but lower specificity. The agreement among different antigens was low. Therefore, serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods. Studies using serological assays to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention programs, or identify risk factors for Leishmania infection may have had their results compromised. The study concludes that the global number of new human cases of VL is estimated to be about 500,000 per year, with Brazil, India, and Sudan accounting for approximately 90% of the estimated global disease prevalence.
Retrotransposons, a type of repetitive element, are abundant in mammalian genomes, with the potential to alter the genome and change gene expression. They are particularly prevalent in pluripotent cells and developing germ cells due to their ability to amplify in these cell types. Host mechanisms are in place to silence retrotransposons in germ cells and pluripotent cells, preventing the accumulation of these repetitive elements in the genome during evolution. However, many mammalian retrotransposons are seldom analyzed, and their silencing in various cell types is not well understood.A study using computational approaches with Illumina and Affymetrix gene expression microarray platforms found that cryptic repetitive element probes can accurately and sensitively monitor repetitive element expression data. This allowed the identification of the histone deacetylase Hdac1 as a component of the retrotransposon silencing machinery in mouse embryonic stem cells, and the determination of the retrotransposon targets of Hdac1 in these cells. The study also identified retrotransposons that are targets of other retrotransposon silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, Eset-mediated histone modification, and Ring1B/Eed-containing polycomb repressive complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells.The study suggests that a complex interplay between silencing mechanisms represses retrotransposon loci in germ cells and embryonic stem cells. Repetitive DNA sequences account for around forty percent of sequenced mammalian genomes, with retrotransposons making up a significant portion of these repetitive elements. While DNA transposons appear to be extinct in the mouse genome, retrotransposons remain active. Retrotransposons can alter the genomic landscape and change gene expression when they amplify or integrate into new sites in the host genome, providing an important driving force for evolutionary change.In summary, retrotransposons are highly prevalent in mammalian genomes and have the potential to significantly impact the genome. Host mechanisms are in place to silence retrotransposons, but many aspects of their silencing in various cell types are not well understood. Computational approaches using gene expression microarray data can help to identify and understand the mechanisms that suppress the activity of retrotransposons in germ cells and pluripotent cells.
Arabidopsis thalianaCRY2 mediates light control of flowering time through its interaction with CIB1, which specifically binds to the FT (Flowering Locus T) promoter in response to blue light and activates FT transcription. Although CIB1 shows a higher affinity for the canonical E-box in vitro, it associates with the non-canonical E-boxes at the FT promoter in vivo. CRY2 also interacts with CIB5, and both CIB1 and CIB5 are associated with the same chromatin region of the FT promoter that contains non-canonical E-box sequences. CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 work redundantly with CIB1 to promote flowering by activating FT expression. CIB proteins form heterodimers to interact with the non-canonical E-box DNA in vivo. CRY2 interacts with at least CIB1 and CIB5 in response to blue light to affect FT transcription and floral initiation. The bHLH factors CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 all bind to the canonical E-box in vitro with a higher affinity than their interaction with other non-canonical E-box DNA sequences, but they associate with the FT promoter in vivo, which lacks a canonical E-box but contains several non-canonical E-boxes.
The U.S. healthcare system may face challenges in diagnosing and treating intestinal parasites such as hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis, which are common in refugees from parasite-endemic countries. These parasites can have serious health consequences if underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. An economic evaluation was conducted to compare the costs and benefits of different intervention strategies for these parasites in U.S.-bound Asian refugees.The evaluation model included four interventions: No Program, U.S. Domestic Screening and Treatment, Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin, and Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides. The analysis was based on an annual cohort of 27,700 refugees and utilized Markov transition state models to estimate long-term health impacts of the parasitic infections. Health outcome measures included outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).The analysis found that the No Program option was the least expensive but also the least effective, resulting in 145 outpatient cases, 4.0 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths over a 60-year period for a one-year cohort. Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin proved to be the most effective option, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458,718 per death averted or $2,219/$24,036 per QALY/life year gained relative to No Program. This intervention was also less expensive than the other options, costing $418,824 compared to $2,182,483 for Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides and $3,832,572 for U.S. Domestic Screening and Treatment.In conclusion, overseas presumptive treatment for U.S.-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs. Specifically, the combination of albendazole and ivermectin resulted in the best health outcomes for refugees and proved to be a cost-effective strategy for managing intestinal parasites.
A new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematocida displodere, was discovered in a wild-caught Caenorhabditis elegans nematode near the Viosne stream in Santeuil, France. This new species has a distinct tropism from other described Nematocida species and has the capacity to initially invade a wide array of tissues and cell types, including the intestine, epidermis, muscle, neurons, and specialized phagocytic cells called coelomocytes. However, the majority of intestinal infection fails to replicate, and comparison of the N. displodere genome with the other Nematocida species shows that despite N. displodere having a smaller genome, it contains an enormously expanded species-specific gene family encoding for RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function, which may explain its distinct infection life cycle. This system provides a convenient model to study the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of tissue tropism using closely related but distinct pathogens infecting a single tractable host.
Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is a debilitating disease associated with developmental and neurological defects, sun sensitivity, and premature aging, with more than 70% of cases having mutations in the CSB protein. CSB is crucial for transcription regulation and transcription-coupled DNA repair, and is part of the SWI2/SNF2 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein family. A study was conducted to understand the chromatin remodeling activity of CSB and its role in transcription-coupled DNA repair. The study found that CSB is a relatively inefficient remodeling enzyme on its own, but its activity is enhanced by NAP1-like histone chaperones. The combined activities of CSB and the NAP1-like chaperones are required for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. The study also found that CSB has two separable functions in transcription-coupled DNA repair: protein factor recruitment and nucleosome remodeling for creating a chromatin environment conducive for DNA repair and/or transcription resumption after repair. The N-terminal 454 amino acids of CSB are important for coupling ATP hydrolysis to chromatin remodeling. The study also revealed that CSB interacts with the histone chaperones NAP1L1 and NAP1L4 both in vitro and in vivo, and these chaperones increase the kinetics of CSB remodeling in a dose-dependent manner. The remodeled products generated by CSB or by CSB and NAP1L1 are canonical nucleosomes, with CSB displaying nucleosome-centralizing activity and the NAP1-like proteins making this activity more apparent.
The study identifies sites with high inter-individual epigenetic variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs), in five purified cell types. VMRs occur preferentially at enhancers and 3’ UTRs, and while the majority of VMRs have high heritability, a subset has low heritability and forms co-regulated networks that differ between cell types. These networks are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways of functional relevance to each tissue. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs is enriched for genes with roles in T-cell activation; in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-regulated VMRs comprises all four HOX gene clusters enriched for control of tissue growth; and in neurons, a network of 18 VMRs is enriched for roles in synaptic signaling. By culturing genetically-identical fibroblasts under varying environmental conditions, the study demonstrates that some VMR networks are responsive to the environment, with methylation levels at these loci changing in a coordinated fashion in trans dependent on cellular growth. These environmentally-responsive VMRs show a strong enrichment for imprinted loci, suggesting that these are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. The study provides a detailed map of common epigenetic variation in the human genome, showing that both genetic and environmental causes underlie this variation.
Dengue is a significant public health threat, with 50-100 million cases reported annually and around 3 billion people at risk. A primary dengue infection confers lifelong protective immunity against the infecting serotype but not cross-protection against other serotypes. A risk factor for severe dengue is a secondary infection with a heterologous serotype. There is currently no licensed dengue vaccine available, and the only means of prevention is through surveillance and vector control. An early and accurate laboratory diagnosis of dengue can assist clinical management. Serological tests for IgM and IgG are routinely used in clinical laboratories for the rapid diagnosis of dengue. Dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been identified as an early marker for acute dengue and is typically present between days 1-9 post-onset of illness. A new Panbio® Dengue Early Rapid test has been developed for the detection of NS1 and has been shown to improve diagnostic sensitivity when used in combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 69.2% and 96%, respectively. The use of NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology can significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extends the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples, enhancing the clinical utility of rapid immunochromatographic testing for dengue.
The prediction of functional RNA structures has gained increased interest due to its potential in studying the functional roles of many genes. However, current RNA structure prediction methods assume a unique functional RNA structure and do not predict the necessary features for in vivo folding. To understand how functional RNA structures form in vivo, sophisticated experiments or reliable prediction methods are required. Currently, there are only a few experimentally validated transient RNA structures and a limited number of computer programs that aim to predict the co-transcriptional folding pathway in vivo. These methods make several simplifying assumptions and do not capture all features known to influence RNA folding in vivo. A new computational method, Transat, has been developed to detect conserved helices of high statistical significance and predict the structural features of known reference structures, including pseudo-knotted ones and those of known alternative structural configurations. Transat can also identify unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provide evidence for new helices which may define folding pathways. The structural features predicted by Transat differ from those assuming thermodynamic equilibrium and work in a comparative way. The method highlights conserved features and does not require detailed knowledge of the cellular environment. RNA molecules play diverse roles in many basic cellular processes, and for many classes of ncRNA molecules, RNA structure plays a crucial part in defining its functional role in the cell. The view that one RNA sequence has one functional RNA structure has turned out to be too simplistic. Therefore, a method that allows identifying evolutionarily conserved structural elements likely required for the formation of functional structures in vivo is desirable. Existing computational methods have limitations, such as relying on energy parameters that depend on temperature, ion concentration, and other parameters, and assuming RNA sequences to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. In vivo, RNA molecules are known to fold co-transcriptionally, and the kinetic folding pathway can differ significantly from the refolding one. Computational methods for RNA structure prediction that take folding kinetics explicitly into account have been developed. These methods model the physical process of an unfolded RNA folding into its functional conformation as a continuous-time Markov process that allows only local rearrangements of secondary structures. However, these methods differ in their implementation, such as modeling entire helices or legal transitions, assumptions about the energy barrier, and accounting for topological constraints. Co-transcriptional folding pathways have been studied experimentally using powerful experimental techniques, but taken from the test tube to the cell to explore how RNA sequences fold in vivo remains an open challenge. A new computational approach for studying RNA folding pathways in vivo has been proposed, taking several evolutionarily related RNA sequences and an evolutionary tree relating these sequences as input, with the goals of detecting evolutionarily conserved structural elements and accounting for interactions with other molecules or other features of the biological environment.
Plant immunity involves a complex network that protects plants from potential pathogenic microbes. This network must function effectively even when components are targeted and disabled by pathogen effectors, which can be achieved through network buffering. Network buffering allows different parts of the network to compensate for loss of function, and these mechanisms are difficult to study using simple genetic means. A network reconstitution strategy was used to resolve systems-level regulatory mechanisms in the Arabidopsis transcriptome response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 (flg22). These mechanisms show widespread evidence of interactions among major sub-networks in the flg22-responsive transcriptome, resulting in network buffering. These interactions are not easily detectable by traditional genetic means, and many of them are concealed by null-mutant analysis of individual genes in the network. Network buffering is important for the resilience of the plant immune signaling network against pathogen assaults and perturbations due to targeting by pathogen effectors. However, network buffering also conceals the identity of network components, making it challenging to correctly assign functions to system components. A reductionist approach applied to analysis of an emergent property of a network is one way to correctly assign component function in the presence of network buffering. This involves fully removing a given network function through deep network perturbation and then stepwise reconstituting the network using combinatorial perturbations.
The central nervous system of many organisms, including Drosophila, develops from monolayered neuroepithelial sheets. These sheets are patterned by various mechanisms into domains, allowing for an increase in neuronal diversity in a controlled spatial and temporal manner. In Drosophila, the neuroepithelial patterning of the embryonic optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primordium and the optic lobe primordium, which develop into the prominent optic ganglia during larval and pupal stages. A genetic network regulates the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as between primary and secondary photoreceptor (PR) precursors. The proneural factor Atonal (Ato) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless (Tll) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. Notch signaling also controls a binary cell fate decision, acting at the top of a cascade of transcription factor interactions to define PR subtype identity. This genetic network illustrates how combinatorial action of cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic factors control neural tissue patterning.
Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD1) is a widely expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide that exhibits different activities between its oxidized and reduced forms. The reduced form of hBD1 has a unique ability to form net-like structures that capture bacteria and inhibit their transmigration independent of bacterial killing. These nets are stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion containing proteases and serve as an additional mechanism of action for hBD1, differing from other defensins. While both forms of hBD1 have distinct antimicrobial profiles and functions, only the reduced form provides additional host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures, preventing bacterial invasion. A better understanding of the modes of action of endogenous host peptides can help find new antimicrobial strategies. The innate immune system relies on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as key effector molecules to protect the human body from bacterial overgrowth and maintain a balanced microbiota. Defensins, small cationic peptides characterized by three intramolecular disulfide-bridges, are important molecules within the innate immune system. Defensins have antimicrobial activity against various microbes and shape the composition of the human microbiota. HBD1 is constitutively expressed by all human epithelia and has been shown to prevent in vivo infections. The antimicrobial activity of hBD1 was previously undervalued, but recent studies have shown that hBD1 has antimicrobial activity against numerous members of the human intestinal microbiota and several pathogenic bacteria under reducing conditions.
In this study, researchers aimed to understand the cause of renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease, which are characterized by congenital cataracts, mental retardation, and renal tubulopathy. Both disorders are caused by mutations in the OCRL1 gene, which encodes an inositol 5-phosphatase enzyme. Despite increased understanding of OCRL1's cellular functions, the underlying basis for the renal tubulopathy is unknown. The study found that OCRL1 deficiency in zebrafish causes a defect in endocytosis in the pronephric tubule, a model for the mammalian renal tubule. This defect coincides with a reduction in levels of the scavenger receptor megalin and its accumulation in endocytic compartments, indicating reduced recycling within the endocytic pathway. These results suggest that OCRL1 is required for endocytic trafficking in vivo, and endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. The study also reveals PIP5K as a potential therapeutic target for these disorders. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease and highlight the importance of endocytic trafficking in renal function.
In a study conducted in the Kilombero river valley of Tanzania, inter-epidemic transmission of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) was investigated in livestock populations. A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected cattle, sheep, and goats from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Tanzania. The study found an overall seroprevalence of 11.3% and a linear increase in prevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts, indicating a constant exposure and presence of active foci of recent transmission preceding the survey. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVFV IgM antibodies, indicating a recent infection. Animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living <5 km. These findings suggest post-epidemic and recent transmission of RVFV in livestock populations in the Kilombero river valley, and the need for continued monitoring and control measures during inter-epidemic periods. RVF is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that affects both livestock and wild ruminants, and can cause mild to severe illness in humans. It is primarily an occupational hazard affecting people in close contact with infected animals, but can also be transmitted through infectious mosquito bites and consumption of unpasteurized animal products.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is an obligate intracellular pathogen that depends on surface proteins to invade its hosts and conserves a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) for osmoregulation. Here, a study used genetic and biochemical approaches to delineate the contribution of the CVC to the traffic of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane and promote host invasion. Results showed that TcRab11, a GTPase that localizes in recycling endosomes in most cells, localizes to the CVC of Dictyostelium discoideum and T. cruzi. In T. cruzi epimastigotes, the polyamine transporter TcPOT1.1, which localizes to CVC-like structures, has been reported to appear in the plasma membrane when the culture medium is deficient in polyamines. The CVC of T. cruzi is an acidic calcium store and has roles in calcium ion sequestration and excretion pathways and in the transfer of some proteins to the plasma membrane. In T. cruzi, TcTS genes are distributed in several families, and TcTS is crucial for the life cycle of the parasite, allowing the acquisition of sialyl residues from the host glycoconjugates. GPI-anchored proteins, including TcTS and TcTSSA II, are transported from the ER to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus. However, in T. cruzi trypomastigotes, TcTS, TcTSSA II, and other mucins are transported to the plasma membrane through the CVC, which also possesses lipid-raft like structures. Expression of dominant-interfering TcRab11 mutants altered the morphology, osmoregulation, traffic of TcTS to the plasma membrane, and parasite infectivity. These results suggest the presence of a novel unconventional mechanism of GPI-anchored protein transport to the cell surface of eukaryotic cells.
This phase III clinical trial compared the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCECV) administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen, compared to the currently recommended 2-site/Thai Red Cross (TRC) regimen. The study enrolled healthy individuals aged ≥1 year, randomized into 4 groups to receive intradermal PCECV according to one of the 2 regimens, with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) administration at first visit for adults. The primary objective was to assess non-inferiority of the immune response of the 4-site/1-week ID PEP regimen to that of the currently recommended 2-site/TRC ID regimen of PCECV, with or without HRIG administration. At D49, non-inferiority was concluded as the difference in percentage of participants with adequate RVNA concentrations between the 4-site/1-week and the 2-site/TRC groups was -1 (95%CI: -2.4--0.0). The 2 regimens had similar safety profiles. The data suggest that the 4-site/1-week regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, with potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination. Rabies is a viral disease caused by viruses belonging to the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family, and is preventable through PEP including vaccination. Current recommendations indicate concomitant administration of rabies immunoglobulins for WHO category III rabies exposures. Intradermal (ID) vaccination regimens have proven to be more cost-effective than intramuscular (IM) ones and are therefore used preferentially. The recommended WHO ID regimen for PEP takes approximately 1 month and requires 4 clinic visits. However, prevention of rabies remains inadequate in developing regions where access to medical care is not optimal. Reducing the number of required visits would reduce costs while increasing compliance to the full PEP course. A newly proposed PEP regimen allows completion of the ID immunization within 1 week and has shown encouraging results in clinical trials. This study aimed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response following vaccination with PCECV according to the new 4-site/1-week ID regimen compared to the updated conventional 2-site/TRC ID regimen with or without concomitant administration of human RIG (HRIG).
The human brain's ability to adapt to rapidly changing, goal-relevant situations is attributed to its capacity to detect and focus on significant goal-related events in a flexible manner. A crucial role in this process is played by the salience network (SN), which includes the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The SN is responsible for the rapid detection of goal-relevant events and facilitates access to appropriate cognitive resources. In this study, the subsecond resolution of large multisession fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project was utilized to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN using novel graph-theoretical techniques. The study found that the SN exhibits distinctive and robust large-scale brain dynamics characteristics. These include the highest levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, the most spatially varied dynamic functional interactions, consistent high levels of network centrality over time, and unique time-varying connectivity profiles that predict individual differences in cognitive flexibility. Moreover, these results were replicated in a second retest dataset, emphasizing their robustness. Overall, this study highlights the SN's unique functional architecture, which facilitates interactions with multiple functional systems, and supports a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain.
Simian Vacuolating Virus 40 (SV40), a nonenveloped virus, goes through a life cycle with several consecutive and tightly regulated steps, including binding, internalization, penetration, replication, assembly, and release. The release step is crucial for the viral life cycle and involves the exit of viral progeny from the cell for infection dissemination. While enveloped virions are released from the cell by budding or membrane fission, nonenveloped viral release typically requires cell lysis after the viral multiplication cycle. SV40 is a polyomavirus that has been extensively studied and serves as a paradigmatic virus to help expand knowledge of the undefined stages of the nonenveloped viral life cycle, including viral release. A new SV40 gene product, VP4, has been identified and found to be expressed at late times during the viral life cycle, coinciding with the time of viral-mediated cell lysis. VP4 is a 125 amino acid protein with a central hydrophobic domain and has been proposed to play a role in viral release. Studies have shown that VP4 efficiently binds red blood cell (RBC) membranes and supports membrane perforation. VP4 also disrupts liposomes mimicking the composition of mammalian plasma and nuclear membranes. The hydrophobic domain of VP4 is essential for membrane binding and disruption, and it displays a preference for membranes comprised of lipids that replicate the composition of the plasma membranes over that of nuclear membranes. These results support a central role for VP4 acting as a viroporin in the perforation of cellular membranes to trigger SV40 viral release, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
The dengue virus (DENV) is a significant public health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite the severity of the disease, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available. The immune response to DENV is not fully understood, and a better understanding of it is crucial for vaccine development. A DNA vaccine, pcTPANS1, containing the signal peptide sequence from the human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) fused to the DENV2 NS1 gene, has been shown to protect mice against dengue. The mechanism of protection involves a combination of cellular and humoral responses. The vaccine induces considerable levels of anti-NS1 antibodies and activates CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The CD4+ cells play a critical role in the protection against dengue, and the transfer of CD4+ T cells combined with anti-NS1 antiserum obtained from vaccinated mice confers protection in mice infected with DENV2. The results suggest that the protective immune response induced by the expression of NS1 antigen mediated by the pcTPANS1 requires a cooperation between CD4+ T cells and the humoral immunity. The development of an effective anti-dengue vaccine is critical for public health, and the understanding of the immunological mechanisms by which a protective immunity against dengue is generated is essential for the development of a vaccine.
In Gram-positive bacteria, cell-to-cell communication, also known as quorum-sensing, is regulated by oligopeptidic pheromones which activate QS systems when they reach a threshold extracellular concentration. These pheromones are matured by species-specific proteases and either detected in the medium by the extracellular receptor domain of histidine kinases of two-component systems or reinternalized through oligopeptide permeases for direct interaction with intracellular receptors. The RNPP superfamily of cytoplasmic QS regulators, characterized by a tetratricopeptide-repeat (TPR)-type peptide-binding domain, regulates important physiological processes such as sporulation, virulence, and conjugation in bacilli or enterococci. ComR regulators, a subgroup of the RNPP family, regulate competence for natural DNA transformation in streptococci. ComR is directly activated by the binding of its associated pheromone XIP, the mature form of the comX/sigX-inducing-peptide ComS. The crystal structure analysis of ComR from Streptococcus thermophilus combined with a mutational analysis and in vivo assays has elucidated the structure-function relationship of the transcription factor ComR. XIP-binding induces release of the sequestered HTH domain and ComR dimerization to allow DNA binding. Importantly, this activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, demonstrating that ComR is not an Rgg protein as initially proposed, but instead constitutes a new member of the RNPP family. Inhibiting competence development constitutes an interesting target in drug discovery as competence activation in streptococci also results in the co-expression of genes involved in virulence-associated functions and predation mechanisms, which are essential for their fitness during infection. Studies have been undertaken to target the well-characterized two-component signaling system ComDE, but targeting the ComRS system has not been explored yet. In this manuscript, the structure-function analysis of the ComRS system from S. thermophilus provides the structural basis required for rational design of inhibitors, and reveals an idiosyncratic regulatory mechanism based on the sequestration of the DNA-binding domain.
The pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC, a prokaryotic homolog of eukaryotic pLGICs, has been functionally characterized through electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. The study identified a class of primary amines as ligands that open the channel by a strongly cooperative process. The open state is comparably stable, but channels desensitize with slow kinetics. X-ray structures reveal electron density in the consensus binding site, suggesting a conserved activation mechanism. ELIC forms cation-selective channels with large single-channel conductance and selectivity properties that resemble other cation-selective members of the family. The ligands, including the neurotransmitter GABA, bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. This study highlights ELIC's potential as an attractive model system to study general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in pLGICs.
Asthma, a prevalent chronic lung disease, is linked to atopic dermatitis (AD) and frequently affects individuals with a history of eczema. However, the mechanism behind the progression from AD to asthma is unclear. A study in mice with skin-barrier defects found that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) overexpressed by skin keratinocytes is the systemic driver of bronchial hyper-responsiveness, leading to an asthmatic phenotype. This was demonstrated through the use of an AD-like model, RBP-j–deficient animals, which sustained high systemic levels of TSLP and developed severe allergic lung inflammation after antigen-induced allergic challenge. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, indicating that high serum TSLP levels are required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. These findings suggest that in addition to early treatment of primary skin-barrier defects, selective inhibition of systemic TSLP may be key to blocking the development of asthma in AD patients.
An approach that integrates multiple omics datasets with bioinformatics tools has been developed, allowing for a detailed annotation of several microbial genomic features. This methodology was used to characterize the genome of Thermotoga maritima, a phylogenetically deep-branching, hyperthermophilic bacterium. Experimental data, including whole-genome resequencing, transcription start site (TSS) determination, transcriptome profiling, and proteome profiling, were analyzed in combination with bioinformatics tools to improve gene annotation, elucidate transcription units (TUs), identify putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and determine promoters and ribosome binding sites. This analysis revealed many distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome organization relative to other bacteria, including a high number of genes per TU, a paucity of putative ncRNAs, few TUs with multiple TSSs, increased sequence conservation of promoters and ribosome binding sites, and a bimodal length distribution of 5'UTRs. These distinctive properties are hypothesized to be a reflection of this organism's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and could yield novel insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on earth. The generation of genome-scale data is becoming more routine, but the subsequent analysis of omics data remains a significant challenge. The approach described here enables an experimentally anchored annotation of several bacterial genomic features, providing a valuable resource to the research community and facilitating quantitative and comparative analysis of annotated features across microbial species.
This study investigates the influence of contextual inputs on visual object recognition, specifically on the perception of a target bar in various contexts. The experiments involve presenting observers with a briefly displayed stimulus of a target bar with varying contrast levels against different contexts, and asking them to judge whether the target bar is present. The results show that observers are more likely to perceive a target when the context has a weaker contrast, and this perception is influenced by the observers' prior belief and internal model of likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The study also suggests that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for this visual inference. The findings demonstrate that context significantly influences the perception of the target bar, and this influence is mediated through a Bayesian inference and decision process. The results highlight the importance of context in visual perception, and provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual inference and decision-making.
Cooperation for the production of costly common goods is observed in nature, but is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors. This can lead to population collapse and the destruction of cooperation. However, small population size, which is more common during population collapse, can favor cooperation. This is because small population size increases variability in cooperator frequency across different locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location. Defectors can also create conditions that rescue cooperation by causing defector-induced population collapse, creating empty locations that favor cooperator migrants, and selecting for mutations adaptive to resource limitation caused by defectors. These mechanisms suggest that defectors can play a role in the persistence of cooperation in a structured population. Previous research has uncovered various mechanisms that promote cooperation, such as recognition of cooperators, spatially-structured environments, limited migration, and kin selection. However, migration to sites with additional resources is necessary for cooperation to survive. A group of spatially-separated populations connected through migration, known as a metapopulation, must have cooperator frequency vary greatly among different populations for cooperation to persist. Small population size, which can be achieved through ecologically-relevant ways such as migration of a small number of individuals to a vacant space or exposure to harsh environments, can promote cooperation. This idea has received theoretical and experimental support in both animals and microbes. The presence of defectors can create small population sizes and increase total biomass in a population, as well as maintain selective pressure for partner recognition. A study found that defectors create conditions that rescue cooperation by causing defector-induced population collapse, creating empty locations that favor cooperator migrants, and selecting for mutations adaptive to resource limitation caused by defectors. These mechanisms promote cooperation by generating large variation in cooperator frequency across a metapopulation. Therefore, defectors provide a built-in mechanism that can rescue cooperation by creating small population sizes.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause both acute and chronic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, burn victims, and patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Chronic pulmonary infections with P. aeruginosa severely impact the quality of life and life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The mucosal barrier presents a significant challenge for P. aeruginosa colonization and bacterial-mediated damage, with infections occurring primarily in patients with altered epithelial cell barriers. A study examining P. aeruginosa's interaction with a polarized epithelium found that the bacterium adheres almost exclusively at sites of multi-cellular junctions, specifically at sites of apoptotic cell extrusion. P. aeruginosa is then internalized through efferocytosis, a process involving the engulfment and disposal of apoptotic cells by surrounding epithelial cells. The bacterium inhabits an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is eventually killed. This elimination of P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis may be part of the host defense mechanism. These findings could be particularly relevant for the study of CF, which is characterized by an exacerbated number of apoptotic cells and ineffective efferocytosis. Overall, the interaction between P. aeruginosa and the epithelial barrier involves the bacterium's adhesion to apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies, internalization by surrounding epithelial cells through efferocytosis, and intracellular elimination.
The Drosophila embryonic gonad is formed from two cell types, Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells (SGPs). PGCs form at the posterior of the blastoderm stage embryo and migrate to reach the SGPs by traversing the midgut wall and moving through the mesoderm. This process is guided by repulsive cues and attractive signals from the SGPs. The hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm and is required for PGC migration. The hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in generating the PGC attractant in both SGPs and other tissues. Ectopic expression of hmgcr promotes the release/transmission of the Hh ligand from cells into and through the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. Potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend upon cholesterol modification. The hh signaling pathway is crucial in patterning in multicellular eukaryotes and has been implicated in cell migration, axonal guidance, and polarized cellular extensions. Long distance hh signaling is mediated by an unusual multistep pathway in which Hh-Np is transmitted from the basolateral membranes of sending cells to the apical surface, where it can contact migrating PGCs. This process depends on several proteins, including HMGCoA reductase (hmgcr), which contains a transmembrane sterol-sensing domain. In hmgcr mutants, Hh-Np is not properly released from sending cells and instead accumulates in punctate aggregates along the basolateral membranes. Geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, a key regulatory target in both isoprenoid and sterol biosynthetic pathways, is used in protein geranylation, including the geranylation of G protein γ subunit 1 (Gγ1), which helps mediate the intracellular trafficking of membrane vesicles and cargo. In hmgcr and qm mutants, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate is not properly synthesized, impeding the release of Hh-Np from hh expressing cells. Many of the factors implicated in the basolateral release and subsequent transmission of Hh-Np in polarized epithelium also function in the signaling pathway that directs migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) to the SGPs during mid-embryogenesis. The Shf protein is enriched in the basolateral ECM and facilitates the long distance transmission of Hh-Np after it has been released from the basolateral membranes of signaling cells. In shf mutants, basolateral accumulation and subsequent spreading of Hh-Np in the wing disc is disrupted, resulting in a reduction in the expression of hh targets in the anterior compartment of the wing. The defects in hh signaling in the wings of shf mutants can be suppressed by overexpression of hmgcr. Shf has no role in Wnt signaling, but functions in the hh pathway to promote hh signaling during embryogenesis. Ectopic shf can upregulate the hh→wingless (wg)→engrailed (en) autoregulatory loop and potentiate hh signaling in the embryo. Shf is expressed in the mesoderm during mid-embryogenesis, when PGCs are migrating, and shf mutants have migration phenotypes, with a subset of PGCs lingering behind on the outside surface of the midgut. Shf is needed for proper PGC migration, and ectopic shf can disrupt the migration of PGCs towards the SGPs.
The development of an effective HIV vaccine remains a significant challenge, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying protection or immune control over HIV replication is essential for future vaccine design strategies. A study examining HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in long-term nonprogressors (LTNP), patients with durable control over HIV replication, revealed that increased cytotoxic capacity of these cells is associated with efficient elimination of HIV-infected CD4+ T-cell targets. Recipients of a replication incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 recombinant vaccine showed readily detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell recall cytotoxic responses, although the magnitude of these responses was significantly less than that of LTNP and overlapped with that of progressors. However, vaccine recipients carrying the protective HLA class I alleles B*27, B*57 or B*58, which have been associated with immune control over HIV replication in chronic infection, showed significantly higher cytotoxic responses. This suggests that these protective HLA class I alleles might lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and following immunization due to more efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses. Understanding the fundamental basis of immunologic control of HIV is crucial for the development of efficacious HIV vaccines and immunotherapies. Studies of rare patients with natural immune control over HIV, such as LTNP, have provided important clues, suggesting that HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are responsible for mediating immune control. Strong and consistent associations between nonprogressive infection and particular HLA class I alleles, such as B*57, have been observed, and these genetic associations are paralleled by functional data demonstrating an overwhelming immunodominance of HLA B57-restricted, HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in LTNP.
The ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior, or collaborate, is a key trait of human behavior and has been crucial in the development of modern human cognition. This trait allows individuals to coordinate actions and make decisions that benefit both parties, and it is present in various aspects of human life, from choosing wallpaper colors with a partner to playing on a sports team. While the benefits of collaboration are clear, the evolutionary origins of this trait are not well understood. A study models the evolution of jointly intentional action and shows that it can emerge under certain conditions. The model uses a multi-level selection framework and considers the evolution of collaboration within and between bands of individuals (deme), who are engaged in a process of cultural accumulation. The model includes two types of individuals: N type individuals, who lack the ability to share intentions and behave individualistically, and SI type individuals, who have the ability to share intentions and can coordinate their choices in tandem with their neighbors. The main results of the paper show that the collaborative sharing of intentions can either speed up or slow down the adoption of new norms on a social network, depending on the benefits from adopting new technologies or norms. When these benefits are low, widespread sharing of intentions within a deme slows the adoption of new technologies, leading to a technological disadvantage and selection against collaboration. However, when the benefits from adopting new technologies or norms are high, widespread sharing of intentions within a deme speeds the adoption of new technologies, leading to a technological advantage and the evolution of collaboration. This is consistent with the idea that composite tool manufacture and grammatical language, which facilitate jointly intentional behavior, evolved around the same time (~300 ka). Overall, the study provides a plausible mechanism for the evolution of jointly intentional action and the role of collaboration in human cognition.
Male fertility requires continuous production of high-quality, motile spermatozoa. Alterations in these metrics cause oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, the leading cause of human sub/infertility. Post-mitotic spermatogenesis, including meiotic stages and spermiogenesis, is transcriptionally inert, indicating the potential importance of the post-transcriptional microRNA (miRNA) gene-silencing pathway. The expression of miRNA generating enzyme Dicer within spermatogenesis peaks in meiosis with critical functions in spermatogenesis. Specific miRNAs, including miR-34b/c, are highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and are associated with male fertility. Reduction in these miRNAs, including miR-34b/c, has been causally associated with reduced fertility in humans. Deletion of both miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci resulted in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia in mice, impairing both meiosis and the final stages of spermatozoa maturation. These findings identify the miR-34 family as the first functionally important miRNAs for spermatogenesis whose deregulation is causal to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility.
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a probiotic strain that has been used for over a century to fight bacterial gastrointestinal infections. EcN is known for its ability to impede intestinal colonization by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and to exhibit an antibacterial activity against enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains. EcN is an excellent colonizer of the human gut and exhibits beneficial effects in various intestinal dysfunctions such as acute diarrhea in infants and toddlers, chronic constipation, and abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. It has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases and has proven to be as effective as the gold standard mesalazine for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis in children and adults. EcN probiotic activity is believed to be based on multiple peculiar properties and fitness determinants, including antibacterial activities against other bacteria.EcN reduces S. Typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for iron through an extensive list of siderophores and multiple siderophore receptors and iron transport systems. In addition to this competition for a limiting nutrient, EcN exhibits a direct antibacterial activity linked to the production of two microcins (Mcc), H47 (MccH47) and M (MccM). Mcc are secreted low-molecular weight peptides that are synthesized by ribosomes and posttranslationally modified, and which display a potent bactericidal activity against phylogenetically-related bacteria. MccH47 and MccM are called “siderophore-Mcc” because they are modified posttranslationally by the linkage of a catechol siderophore. The C-terminus of the Mcc peptide is covalently bound with a linearized and glycosylated derivative of enterobactin. This siderophore moiety is recognized by the catecholate-siderophore receptors of the target bacterium, allowing the siderophore-Mcc to enter and kill the sensitive bacterium by a “Trojan Horse” stratagem.However, EcN is closely related to pathogenic E. coli strains such as the uropathogenic strain CFT073 and carries the pks island encoding a NRPS-PKS assembly line that synthesizes the genotoxin colibactin. Colibactin is produced as a prodrug moiety that is exported in the periplasm by the efflux pump ClbM and then hydrolyzed by the periplasmic membrane-bound ClbP protein with a peptidase activity, which releases the active colibactin. Colibactin is not only a bona fide virulence factor but also a putative procarcinogenic compound.Recent studies have shown that EcN probiotic properties are related to the presence of the pathogenicity island, and that certain enzymes of the pks/clb island enable the synthesis of analgesic lipopeptides. Therefore, it is crucial to specifically decouple the genotoxic activity from the antagonistic activity to optimize EcN. Researchers have successfully decoupled the antibacterial activity from the genotoxic activity by specifically abrogating the genotoxic activity of colibactin. This opens the way to optimize EcN, but further research is needed to fully understand the interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways and their role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. This co-evolution observed in EcN illustrates the fine margin between pathogenicity and probiotic activity, and the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of probiotics.
Cryptococcus neoformans, a leading cause of fatal fungal meningitis worldwide, has an anti-phagocytic polysaccharide capsule containing xylose, a sugar absent in model yeasts. Uxt1 and Uxt2 are xylose donor transporters with distinct localization, expression patterns, and kinetic parameters, and are essential for xylose incorporation into capsule and protein, and for virulence. In C. neoformans, glycans are critical for normal development, growth, and viability, with extensive glycoconjugate repertoire acting as a virulence factor. Glycans play structural and regulatory roles in fungal survival and pathogenesis. Glycosylation is synthesized in the secretory pathway, relying on nucleotide sugar donors synthesized in the cytosol. Nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) facilitate this process, and NST dysfunction affects cryptococcal viability and pathogenicity. Cells lacking Uxt1 and Uxt2 lack xylose in all analyzed glycoconjugates, exhibiting growth defects and metabolic abnormalities, and are required for virulence in a mouse model of disease but not for fungal viability in the context of infection.
A global database for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), including schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and leishmaniasis, is being developed to support spatial disease risk modeling, target control interventions, disease monitoring, and surveillance. The database, which is open-access and spatially explicit, contains over 12,000 georeferenced schistosomiasis survey locations in Africa, and is constantly updated with new publications, reports, and field data. The database was initially created to support the CONTRAST project, which aims to enhance understanding of schistosomiasis transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. The database was populated through a systematic review of peer-reviewed journals, grey literature, and personal communication, and includes data on survey location, date, number of individuals examined and found schistosome-positive, and additional survey-specific data. The database has the potential to identify areas with no information on disease burden, foster geographical modeling over time and space, and control and monitor NTDs.
Chronic helminth infections, which affect about one third of the world's population, can lead to a Th2 immune shift and an immunoregulatory milieu, potentially suppressing Th1 immunity necessary for controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. A study was conducted using cotton rats, the natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis, to determine the impact of chronic helminth infections on MTB. Two months after MTB challenge, spleen cell proliferation and interferon gamma production were similar between co-infected and MTB-only infected animals. However, MTB loads and lung granulomas were not increased in co-infected animals. These findings suggest that chronic filaria infections do not exacerbate MTB infection in the cotton rat model. This indicates that filaria eradication programs may not facilitate MTB control but implies that it may be possible to develop worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases that do not substantially increase the risk for infections.
The DEG/ENaC family of ion channels, which includes the pickpocket (ppk) channels in Drosophila melanogaster, are widely expressed in both peripheral and central nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates. Despite their ubiquity, the physiological functions of most DEG/ENaC family members remain unknown. However, recent research suggests that these channels may play important chemosensory roles. Specifically, the study found that the DEG/ENaC channel ppk23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles that are distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting activity of ppk23-expressing neurons delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship, and altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7, 11-Heptacosadiene. These findings indicate that ppk23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila. This research adds to the understanding of the complex mechanisms by which animals monitor their chemical environment and guide their behavior, and highlights the importance of ion channels in these processes.
Mitochondria, organelles found in almost all eukaryotic cells, contain a genetic system that encodes a number of protein-coding genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. In many organisms, the number of mitochondrial tRNA genes is not sufficient to ensure mitochondrial translation, and nucleus-encoded tRNAs have to be imported from the cytosol to mitochondria. The regulation of tRNA mitochondrial import is limited in our understanding, and tRNA import can occur under certain circumstances even when mitochondrial genomes are equipped with a minimal set of tRNA genes sufficient for mitochondrial translation. The nucleus-encoded tRNAs imported into mitochondria are used in the cytosolic translation machinery, and variations between the extents of mitochondrial localization of individual nucleus-encoded tRNAs have been observed. A study on the green alga Chlamydomonas found that tRNA import cannot be rapidly regulated in response to a novel genetic context, suggesting that the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutive adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery.
Diabetes is a significant global health issue, with over 30 million adults in the US and 422 million worldwide affected. Prediabetes, which affects 84 million in the US, has an annual conversion rate of approximately 10% to type 2 diabetes. While diabetes is genetically heterogeneous, it is also physiologically diverse. Blood glucose levels are regulated by insulin and other organs, and insulin resistance or deficiency can lead to elevated blood glucose. Lifestyle interventions, including personalized dietary recommendations, have been shown to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes in prediabetic individuals. Current diagnostics for diabetes and prediabetes rely on HbA1c or single-time-point measurements of blood glucose, which may miss substantial glucose elevations and fail to account for glycemic variability. A new measure of glucose variability derived from the spectral clustering of glycemic signatures using time-series-specific distance metrics has been proposed. This method can classify individuals into different glucotypes, providing a more comprehensive, dynamic, and granular understanding of diabetes etiology, detect glucose dysregulation at earlier stages of disease, and personalize diet for optimal glucose response. Many individuals not known to be prediabetic by standard measures have high levels of postprandial glucose, and a subset of normoglycemic individuals can reach prediabetic or diabetic glucose levels following standardized meals. Therefore, a comprehensive metric of glycemic variability that encompasses all components of glucose signatures is expected to provide a more accurate understanding of diabetes etiology, detect glucose dysregulation at earlier stages of disease, and personalize diet for optimal glucose response.
EDR1 is a negative regulator of plant defense in Arabidopsis, including resistance to pathogens and ethylene-induced senescence. EDR1 negatively regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade to modulate plant defense and cell death. This regulation occurs through direct interaction of EDR1 with MKK4 and MKK5, and involves the negative regulation of MKK4 and MKK5 protein levels. The N-terminal regulatory domain of EDR1 is responsible for this interaction, and may act as a scaffold protein to keep MKK4 and MKK5 in a catalytically inactive state. Alternatively, EDR1 may affect the stability of MKK4 and MKK5 directly through interactions with the 26S proteasome degradation machinery. The edr1 mutant shows enhanced resistance to pathogens, and this resistance is dependent on MKK4 and MKK5 function, providing direct genetic evidence that these kinases are key players in plant immunity responses. The kinase activity of MPK3/MPK6 can be repressed through dephosphorylation mediated by several different phosphatases and by modulation of MKK4 and MKK5 protein levels by EDR1, providing a mechanism for fine-tuning the activity of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in response to pathogen attack.
Infectious diseases pose a significant global healthcare problem, leading to millions of deaths each year, particularly among poor and young populations in low and middle-income countries. To develop effective control and prevention strategies, reliable computational tools are needed to understand disease dynamics and predict future cases. A study developed a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases, outperforming two standard machine learning algorithms in predicting Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in Turkey. Gaussian processes can capture highly complex dependencies in disease modeling scenarios, making them valuable for identifying dependencies and making more reliable predictions. This framework can significantly contribute to public health policy makers by enabling temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal predictions, allowing for better-informed decisions on vaccine purchases, public awareness campaigns, and training programs for healthcare workers.
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis in Africa and the Middle East that causes human deaths and significant economic losses due to large-scale livestock mortality and abortions. Outbreaks of RVF are sporadic and associated with seasonal and socio-economic factors. Here, a three-patch model is proposed to investigate the transmission dynamics of RVFV among ruminants with spatial movements. The findings suggest that human activities, particularly those associated with the Eid al Adha feast, and a combination of climatic factors contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen. Sporadic outbreaks may occur when abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk from RVF due to the demand for the religious festival and abundant numbers of mosquitoes emerge. Numerical results present the transmission dynamics of the disease pathogen over both short and long periods, particularly during the festival time. Simulations show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in the place where the religious ceremony will be held. A single case of RVF can rapidly spread to an epidemic when there is a co-occurrence of high densities of arthropod vectors and large numbers of susceptible individuals in a population. This co-occurrence can happen for a number of reasons, such as the combination of climatic factors that favor the growth of a vector population and human activities, such as events involving large congregations of hosts in one place, around the same time, perhaps periodically. In the case of RVFV, a vector-borne pathogen endemic in Africa and the Middle East, the co-occurrence of annual flood stages of a river that promotes high densities of disease vector mosquitoes and a religious festival, the Eid al Adha feast, at which time large numbers of livestock are driven towards the site of the feast, creates a particular periodicity of times of high potential for disease outbreaks. These two events follow different calendars, solar (365.25 days) and lunar (354.37 days), and coincide perfectly only every 33.57 years, although partial overlap occurs in other years surrounding those of perfect coincidence.
"The study assessed the spatial and temporal changes in the occurrence of human anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010. The results showed an annual percentage change in incidence of +11.95% from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline of -35.24% after the initiation of livestock vaccination in 1996. The geographic distribution of reporting also shifted from the west to the east over the study period. Despite the decrease in incidence, continued control measures are needed in livestock to further mitigate the occurrence of anthrax. The study highlights the need for a ""One Health"" approach that considers the changing geographic distribution of the disease. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to profound alterations in disease management and an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria. Similarly, the deterioration of public health infrastructure and new agricultural policies led to a reported increase in zoonotic diseases, such as anthrax, in the former Soviet Union. Effective control of the disease in humans is highly dependent on mitigating the disease in animals through vaccination campaigns and proper outbreak management. A ""One Health"" approach that integrates animal and human health has been shown to be effective for other zoonoses such as rabies and brucellosis. However, there is limited research on the benefits of a ""One Health"" approach for anthrax. Anthrax is a soil-borne, bacterial zoonosis that primarily occurs in herbivores and can result in significant economic losses from livestock mortality and lost worker productivity. In Azerbaijan, anthrax has a long history and is considered sporadic, although it is bordered by endemic and hyperendemic countries. A comprehensive preemptive livestock vaccination program was established in 1996, following a series of livestock anthrax outbreaks. Anthrax has recently reemerged in the Caucasus, raising concerns over the potential trans-boundary spread of the disease. Spatial and temporal analyses can aid in disease management by providing a better understanding of anthrax epidemiology."
Voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels are membrane proteins that respond to changes in membrane potential by enabling K+ ion flux across the membrane. They can be modulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which induce channel opening by modulating the voltage-sensitivity. This provides an effective treatment for refractory epilepsy through a ketogenic diet. A study using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations found a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the Shaker KV channel, located at the protein-lipid interface in the vicinity of the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD). The lipophilic PUFA tail covered a wide range of non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while the carboxylic head group displayed more specific interactions to polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices, encompassing the S3-S4 linker. PUFAs have increased conformational flexibility in the polyunsaturated carbon tails compared to saturated carbon chains, which may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins. Voltage-gated ion channels are critical for propagating nerve impulses, muscle contraction, and hormone secretion, making them attractive drug targets. KV channels can be modulated by a wide variety of molecules, including PUFAs, which shift the voltage dependence of the channel to enable channel activation via a proposed electrostatic mechanism.
Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that causes significant disease burden among children in developing countries and can result in chronic and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. However, the currently available drugs lack efficacy in treating these severe conditions. The discovery and development of novel anti-cryptosporidial therapeutics has been hampered by the poor experimental tractability of this pathogen. The genome sequencing effort has identified several new targets, including a unique inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). A new study has developed a pipeline of tools to accelerate the in vivo screening of inhibitors of C. parvum IMPDH. They genetically engineered the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii to serve as a model of C. parvum infection and established a fluorescence-based assay of host cell proliferation and a C. parvum growth assay. These assays have been used to evaluate C. parvum IMPDH inhibitors emerging from their medicinal chemistry effort and have identified a subset of 1,2,3-triazole ethers that exhibit excellent in vivo selectivity in the T. gondii model and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity. This study provides a significant step towards the development of new chemotherapy for cryptosporidiosis.
"A genome-wide association study of tooth development in infancy was conducted among individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The study tested for associations with time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth by one year of age. Five genetic loci were identified at genome-wide significance (P<5×10−8), including KCNJ2, EDA, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, and MSRB3. These genes have links to tooth and other organ development, and are implicated in the development of cancer. The strongest association was for SNP rs8079702, located downstream of KCNJ2, which has been implicated in Pierre Robin sequence and Andersen-Tawil syndrome, characterized by abnormalities in tooth development and craniofacial anomalies. The five top SNPs explain 2.9% of the variance of both tooth eruption time and number of teeth in the NFBC1966, and 4.2% and 4.0% of the variance in tooth eruption and number of teeth in ALSPAC. These estimates may overestimate the true values due to the ""winner's curse"". The study also identified five loci with SNPs that had P-values between 5×10−6 and 5×10−8, including rs6504340, located between the developmental regulatory genes HOXB1 and HOXB2, and SNP rs12424086, located close to the HMGA2 gene. The study found an association between a variant within the HOXB gene cluster and the requirement for orthodontic treatment due to defective occlusion by the age of 31 years. The findings could have implications for the study of other developmental and organogenic processes."
The trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), causing Down syndrome (DS), is the most common viable human aneuploidy, while complete monosomy (M21) of Hsa21 is lethal. Only partial monosomy or mosaic monosomy of Hsa21 is seen, leading to variable physiological abnormalities with constant intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. A new mouse model, Ts3Yah, with a tandem duplication of the Hspa13-App interval syntenic with 21q11.2-21q21.3, was created to search for dosage-sensitive genes involved in DS and M21 phenotypes. The trisomy of this region alters locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance. The expression profiling of skeletal muscles revealed global changes in the regulation of genes implicated in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. These genes are downregulated in Ts3Yah mice and upregulated in Ms3Yah mice. The shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlates with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without an alteration in the respiratory function. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms3Yah mice, while the membrane permeability of Ts3Yah mitochondria slightly increased. Therefore, the Hspa13-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles certainly as a consequence of change in dose of Gabpa, Nrip1, and Atp5j. The copy number variation in the Hspa13-App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.
G protein-gated K+ channels, also known as GIRK or Kir3 channels, are crucial for regulating heartbeat and neuronal excitability and plasticity. They can be activated by Gβγ subunits derived from Gi/o proteins, and are activated to varying degrees by both neurotransmitter-evoked (Ievoked) and neurotransmitter-independent basal (Ibasal) activities. However, the relationship between Ibasal and Ievoked has been unclear. A recent study has shown that Ibasal and Ievoked are interrelated, with the extent of activation by neurotransmitter being inversely related to Ibasal. This behavior can be explained by a quantitative model of GIRK1/2 function, which accurately recapitulates Ibasal and Ievoked in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons. The model indicates that there are consistently between 3 and 4 Gβγ dimers available for each GIRK1/2 channel, while the number of available Gαi/o decreases as the density of GIRK1/2 increases. This suggests a strong association of GIRK1/2 with Gβγ, but not Gα, and a maximal stoichiometry of 4 Gβγ but only 2 Gαi/o per one GIRK1/2 channel. These unique and unequal associations, along with the cooperative nature of GIRK gating by Gβγ, allow GIRK1/2 to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both Gβγ and Gα.
"The paper discusses the use of plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria, which secrete TALEs (Transcription Activator-Like Effectors) into host cells to act as transcriptional activators on plant target genes and support bacterial virulence. The authors propose a novel approach for TALE target prediction, termed PrediTALE, to identify potential virulence targets. The approach considers recent findings concerning TALE targeting, such as frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths and the flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. The computational model can account for dependencies between adjacent RVD positions and is benchmarked using RNA-seq data after Xanthomonas infection in rice.The authors find an overall improvement in prediction performance compared with previous approaches and are able to predict several novel putative virulence targets. However, they also observe that no target genes are predicted by any prediction tool for several TALEs, which they term ""orphan TALEs."" They propose that one explanation for orphan TALEs is incomplete gene annotations and suggest replacing promoterome-wide by genome-wide scans for target boxes. They demonstrate that known targets from promoterome-wide scans may be recovered by genome-wide scans, whereas the latter, combined with RNA-seq data, can detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.Xanthomonas bacteria can infect many crop plants, including rice, and cause disease, resulting in substantial yield losses. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) express TALE proteins, which function as transcription factors in infected host cells. The DNA-binding domain of TALE proteins consists of tandem repeats, with each repeat comprising approximately 34 highly conserved amino acids (except for the amino acids at position 12 and 13, which are responsible for DNA specificity). Recent studies have shown that naturally occurring TALEs may activate susceptibility (S) genes that are responsible for bacterial growth, proliferation, and disease development, as well as disease resistance (R) genes.The authors also mention that most known target boxes are directly preceded by a ‘T’, while ‘C’ and ‘A’ occur with decreasing frequencies. However, some repeats deviate from the common length of 34 AAs and have been termed aberrant repeats. These aberrant repeats may loop out of the repeat array when a TALE binds to its DNA target box, allowing for increased flexibility and binding to frame-shifted target boxes. Different Xoo and Xoc strains express different repertoires of TALEs, where a single strain may host up to 27 TALEs."
A new machine-learning algorithm called APOGEE has been developed to estimate the harmfulness of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations. It outperforms existing prediction methods and is designed to address the limitations of traditional methods which have shown only 60-70% agreement when considering all possible human non-synonymous variants. APOGEE provides a detailed description of its algorithm, training and test sets of variants, and classification ability. The algorithm was built using 100 sets of variants drawn randomly from a training set of 864 known mitochondrial variants and achieved better performance rates compared to other individual and meta-predictors tools. APOGEE's performance was further validated using two non-overlapping test sets, and its predictions were shown to be in line with those previously shown. The authors plan to integrate additional evolutionary measures and the impact of co-inherited missense variants in future releases of APOGEE.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral infection, leading to a range of diseases from dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Thrombocytopenia, a significant correlation with dengue severity, is a major characteristic observed in both mild and severe dengue disease. A study explored the role of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) in platelet activation and thrombocytopenia development during DENV infection. The researchers found that DENV NS1, and not Zika virus NS1, could induce P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine exposure in human platelets, which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. These effects were blocked in the presence of anti-NS1 F(ab')2, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist (Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide, LPS-Rs), and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor (TAK242), but not polymyxin B. DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. The binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection. DENV NS1 plays a critical role in dengue pathogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo, by enhancing DENV replication/infection, directly inducing vascular leakage, and causing cytokine release from immune cells. Relative levels of NS1 antigen in dengue patients' sera were negatively correlated with platelet count. The study suggests that DENV NS1 can directly trigger platelet activation and apoptosis through TLR4 signal transduction and enhance platelet aggregation in the presence of a subthreshold dose of ADP. These effects may contribute to platelet activation and thrombocytopenia during DENV infection.
The dynamic control loops regulating vasomotor tone of vascular smooth muscle, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure involve the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, the atrial natriuretic peptide system (ANP), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These systems regulate blood pressure by affecting vasoconstriction and blood volume. The AVP system, which involves hormones produced in the hypothalamus and released into the bloodstream, has vasoconstrictive effects and increases water permeability in the kidneys. The ANP system, which involves hormones produced in the heart in response to atrial stretching, has vasorelaxing effects. The RAAS system, which involves hormones produced in the kidneys in response to low blood pressure or low sodium chloride concentration in the tubule at the macula densa, has vasoconstrictive effects and increases production of aldosterone, which promotes sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. These systems have been analyzed using mathematical models, which reveal that they consist of negative-feedback loops that admit a single equilibrium that can either be stable or give rise to oscillatory instability. The system of dynamic control loops regulating vasomotor tone, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure can be combined with cellular-level mechanisms to form a complete system, which can be analyzed using system-theoretic and control-theoretic approaches. These analyses suggest that the physiological mechanisms regulating long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters are arranged into a complex of equivalent loop systems, consisting of candidate oscillators with a single equilibrium point. The whole system can be split into two systems displaying essentially the same functioning, an apparent redundancy that could offer alternatives for coping with accidental defaults.
Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 900,000 cases per year in the USA resulting in 300,000 deaths. This paper explores the role of a fibrin cap in preventing small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events. The fibrin cap, which forms on the surface of a thrombus, is capable of stopping blood clot growth by interfering with the transport of thrombin to the thrombus surface. Thrombin is a potent platelet activator and is required for fibrin generation. By interfering with thrombin transport to the thrombus surface, the fibrin cap limits further growth.The formation of a fibrin network on the thrombus surface provides a mechanism to limit continued growth of small thrombi. The network does not provide a transport barrier for thrombin but rather a shield blocking resting platelets from approaching sites of thrombin generation. The suggested mechanism may prevent small thrombi, which frequently form as a result of activation or damage of a few endothelial cells, from growing into symptomatic occlusive clots.Experimental measurements of protein diameter distributions and fibrin network permeability were conducted using dynamic light scattering and Darcy's equation, respectively. The fibrin network permeability was found to substantially decrease as the fibrinogen concentration increased. The calculated fiber radii ranged from 150 nm to 500 nm, which is in good agreement with fiber thicknesses evaluated directly from confocal images and with previously reported values of hydrated fiber bundles of coarse gels.The diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions of thrombin and Fab IgG were obtained by fitting experimental data using Levenberg-Marquardt curve-fitting. The resulting diffusion coefficients were plotted as a function of fibrinogen concentration. The diffusion coefficient of thrombin and Fab IgG in solution in the absence of fibrinogen were found to be 1102.6 /s and 400.9 , respectively.In summary, the formation of a fibrin cap on the surface of a thrombus can prevent small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events by interfering with the transport of thrombin to the thrombus surface. The fibrin network does not provide a transport barrier for thrombin but rather a shield blocking resting platelets from approaching sites of thrombin generation. The fibrin network permeability substantially decreases as the fibrinogen concentration increases, providing a mechanism to limit continued growth of small thrombi.
In the study of iNKT cells and their role in limiting microbial growth during infection, research has shown that iNKT cells control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth in a CD1d-dependent manner, but not through IL-12, IL-18, or IFNγ. The study found that iNKT cells produce GM-CSF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1d-dependent manner during Mtb infection, and that GM-CSF is both necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth. This discovery highlights the importance of GM-CSF in T cell immunity against Mtb, and the novel mediator of iNKT cell antimicrobial activity. CD1 restricted T cells have been proposed to have a role in antimicrobial immunity, and iNKT cells have been shown to influence many different immunological conditions. iNKT cells can be activated through high affinity antigens or through a weak lower affinity self or microbial ligand in the context of costimulatory signals. However, the specific role of iNKT cells during infection and whether their activation by different pathways leads to the expression of diverse functions is still unclear. The study of iNKT cells during infection has relied heavily on mouse models that lack iNKT cells or administered αGalCer, but less is known about the physiological role of iNKT cells during infection. While it is established that iNKT cells can produce various cytokines and chemokines and have immunomodulatory effects, the direct antimicrobial role of iNKT cells for most infections is still unknown. Despite this, there is evidence that activated iNKT cells enhance host resistance to Mtb, with iNKT cells being important for neutrophil recruitment to the lung during Pseudomonas infection, and IFNγ being required for protection by iNKT cells against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, the study of iNKT cells and their role in antimicrobial immunity is complex and ongoing, but the discovery of GM-CSF production as a novel iNKT cell antimicrobial effector function provides a promising direction for future research.
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a common component of the human intestinal flora, and its interactions with the host play crucial roles in health and disease. A study of C. albicans genes expressed during growth within a host found that the EFH1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during growth in the intestinal tract. However, an efh1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, while an EFH1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and oral cavity of athymic mice. The EFH1 gene regulates the level of colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. Additionally, different genes are required in different host niches and the pathways that regulate gene expression during host colonization can differ from well-characterized pathways used during laboratory growth. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of C. albicans colonization and the importance of studying gene expression during growth within a host.
Immunization with irradiated sporozoites is an effective strategy against liver stages of malaria parasites, and the mechanisms underlying this protection involve prolonged antigen presentation. CD8+ T cell responses require sporozoite antigen to persist for over 8 weeks after immunization, taking place in lymphoid organs dependent on CD11c+ cells. This persistent antigen enhances the magnitude of CD8+ T cell responses, impacting the final size of memory populations, full development of memory cells, and the priming of naïve cells to become functional effector cells. These findings highlight the importance of prolonged antigen presentation in generating protective immunity against malaria liver stages. Studying irradiated Plasmodium sporozoites, which induce robust protective CD8+ T cell responses without persisting infection, can provide valuable insights into the role of antigen persistence in the absence of persisting infection.
Leishmaniasis, a public health problem in tropical countries, is a neglected disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) caused by over 20 species of protozoa from the genus Leishmania. The intracellular parasite hosts mammalian macrophages and establishes three types of infections: visceral, mucocutaneous, and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Currently, 70-75% of CL cases are present in 10 tropical countries, and it causes ulcerated lesions in the skin, which can evolve to disfigurement, mutilation and allow secondary infection by bacteria. The treatment for CL relies on several drugs, including meglumine antimoniate, sodium stibogluconate, pentamidine, amphotericin B deoxycholate, liposomal amphotericin B, fluconazole, ketoconazole, miltefosine, and paromomycin. However, these drugs present side effects, require hospitalization, and have shown some reports on drug resistance. The use of nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers can overcome drug resistance, side effects, and unspecific biodistribution of microbicidal agents. In this study, the authors produced PBCAnp adsorbed with polB to evaluate its leishmanicidal effect and its viability as a functionalized antibacterial carrier. The results showed that PBCAnp had a spherical shape and a size of around 200 nm, which is adequate to enhance macrophage phagocytic activity and activation of the complement system. The D10 value is higher than 100 nm, which means that 10% of total particles are under the reported particle size value. The mean particle size and D values were higher when measured by DLS than those by NTA. PolB was incorporated in NPs by electrostatic adsorption, and the efficiency of incorporation was stable. PBCAnp-polB presented 17.7% (885 μg/mL) on t = 1 day and 16.8% (840 μg/mL) on t = 45 days. PBCAnp-polB resulted in approximately 2.4 x 105 molecules of polB per nanoparticle. The experimental drug loading for PBCAnp-polB was 10.53% as compared to a theoretical value of 8.76%. The cellulose membrane used to separate the test compartments is widely used with proteins and described as having low binding with them, in addition to having 12--14 kDa membrane pores, which are at least 12 times larger than polB (1, 023 kDa). Therefore, delayed time can be attributed to drug diffusion rate through the membrane. The release profile confirmed a sustained release of polB from NPs, adequate for prolonged antimicrobial effect. Leishmanicidal activity tests were performed in vitro with Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. The IC50 value found for free polB was 77.1 μg/mL (59.2 μM). However, the standard drug meglumine antimoniate presented an average IC50 value of 49 to 60 μg/mL, which was measured in reference strains of the same species. It is important to note that the current model of in vitro susceptibility testing may undermine leishmanicidal efficacy since these peptides can be inactivated by fetal bovine serum and high saline concentration in culture media. PolB binding to serum also favors its cell entrance without its membrane activity; consequently, degradation can occur and aminoacids serve as nutritional molecules, which may explain the increased growth and high standard deviation of the less concentrated samples. In addition, several drugs had lower activity in extracellular Leishmania forms. PolB treatment with 10 μg/mL had similar behavior of 20 μg/mL, with no statistical difference, except for low infected counting. Therefore, increments in polB concentration were not enough to increase its leishmanicidal efficacy. As described before, a cutaneous lesion caused by Leishmania is frequently contaminated by bacteria, which can lead to a more serious secondary infection or even worse, the leishmaniasis, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, the microbicidal activity of the formulations was tested. The minimum inhibitory concentration used of polB and PBCAnp-polB was 2 μg/mL, in triplicate, by visual determination. All visual determinations corroborated with O. D. analysis. Incorporation of polB in NPs did not change MIC results, which is in accordance with the lack of antimicrobial activity from the carrier (at the same dilutions tested for the loaded version). Therefore, this test confirms that polB remains active and bound polB is released fast enough to maintain the 24-hour result from the polB alone.
This historical cohort study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, using data from the Reportable Disease Information System (SINAN) from 2002 to 2009. The study identified variables associated with death from VL, which were used to create a prognostic score. The prognostic score was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The study found that weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, other associated infections, bleeding, jaundice, and age ≥60 years were associated with death from VL. These findings are consistent with previous studies and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The study highlights the importance of early detection of these factors to identify vulnerable patients and reduce the lethality of the disease. The case fatality rate in Belo Horizonte is one of the highest in Brazil, and several factors, such as accessibility to health services, suspicion of VL, delayed diagnosis, treatment opportunity, clinical management, drug toxicity, comorbidities, and Leishmania population in circulation, could contribute to the unacceptable fatality rates. The study suggests that knowledge of the laboratory and clinical profiles of patients and their association with death from VL could assist in clinical management and reduce lethality. Other studies have identified various risk factors associated with lethality from VL, such as mucosal hemorrhage, jaundice, dyspnea, bacterial infections, reduced number of neutrophils and platelets, fever for more than 60 days, diarrhea, anemia, and undernutrition. Delay in diagnosis has also been associated with death from VL, and reducing delay in diagnosis could improve VL case outcomes. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of early detection and effective measures to reduce the lethality of VL.
The Arabidopsis thaliana BAK1/SERK3 protein is a regulatory receptor-like kinase that plays crucial roles in plant growth, cell death control, and innate immunity, but is not required for ligand binding in ligand-dependent heteromers with several ligand-binding LRR-RKs. A novel allele of BAK1, bak1-5, was identified in a forward-genetic screen for elf18-insensitive mutants. The bak1-5 mutation is a single missense substitution in the 10th exon of BAK1, which leads to a C408Y change in the subdomain VIa of the cytoplasmic kinase preceding the catalytic loop. The bak1-5 mutation specifically affects the accumulation of the BAK1 protein, and bak1-5 transgenic plants are strongly impaired in flg22- and elf18-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and thus phenocopied the bak1-5 mutant. Moreover, bak1-5 is a semi-dominant allele with a dose-sensitive dominant-negative effect on the endogenous wild-type BAK1, indicating that it has a specific phenotype related to PAMP responsiveness. In contrast to the previously reported bak1-4 mutant plants, bak1-5 plants were strongly affected in all flg22 and elf18 responses measured and were more strongly impaired in PTI signaling than the null allele bak1-4, particularly with EFR-dependent responses. The bak1-5 plants were hyper-susceptible and supported bacterial multiplication to similar levels as in efr fls2 leaves upon spray-infection with Pto DC3000 COR−. The impairment of bak1-5 in bacterial resistance was further supported by the increased disease symptoms observed after spray-infection with Pto DC3000 COR−. The compromised PTI signaling capacity of bak1-5 leads to a reduced ability to launch effective defense responses culminating in hyper-susceptibility to bacteria.
A new experimental and computational approach has been developed to better understand the antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment in cancer cell populations. This approach combines time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data to create a computer rendering of the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during and after treatment. The effects of treatments are modelled with modules describing the functional activity of the main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase. A framework modelling environment is used to apply different types of modules in each phase and test models at the complexity level justified by the available data. The method is then challenged with time-course measures taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy in X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells, spanning a wide range of doses. This allows for the construction of the most suitable model of the treatment, including the dose-response of each effect, combining modules with a rational strategy and fitting simultaneously all data of different doses and platforms. The final model provides a complete rendering in silico of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, providing separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S and G2M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. This new approach has the potential to improve our understanding of the complexity of the antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment and inform the development of more effective therapies.
Coenzyme Q (CoQ), an essential electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has been implicated in a variety of human mitochondrial diseases. Its biosynthesis involves the production of polyisoprenoid diphosphate, which requires enzymes encoded by PDSS1 and PDSS2. Homozygous mutations in these genes lead to severe neuromuscular disease, with nephrotic syndrome seen in PDSS2 deficiency. A study found that a presumed autoimmune kidney disease in mice with the missense Pdss2kd/kd genotype can be attributed to a mitochondrial CoQ biosynthetic defect. The disease manifestations specifically originate in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease is seen in Podocin/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice but not in conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional B6. Alb/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice have no overt disease despite demonstrating undetectable CoQ9 levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and significantly altered intermediary metabolism. These findings suggest that disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes displaying the greatest sensitivity to Pdss2 impairment. CoQ is a benzoquinone molecule that functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, transporting electrons from complexes I or II to complex III. In mice and humans, the polyisoprenylated side chain of CoQ is formed by polyisoprenyl diphosphate synthases, each a heterotetramer of two protein subunits encoded by Pdss1 and Pdss2 in mice and PDSS1 and PDSS2 in humans. Mutations in these genes have been associated with rare conditions of primary CoQ deficiency in humans, typically presenting with neurologic or myopathic disease that is often ameliorated with CoQ supplementation. Nephrotic syndrome has been seen in individuals with mutations in PDSS2 as well as COQ2. Mechanisms underlying tissue-specific disease manifestations remain unclear.
Phenotypic robustness is the ability of a phenotypic trait to remain invariant in the face of environmental or genetic perturbations, allowing maintenance of high fitness even under suboptimal conditions and facilitating adaptation under certain conditions. The genetic basis of phenotypic robustness includes mechanisms such as capacitors, molecular chaperones, and functional redundancy at the gene and systems levels. Development, a key component of phenotypic robustness, is not well understood in terms of its underlying mechanism. However, a study of three invertebrates with determinative development (Caenorhabditis elegans, Pellioditis marina, and Halocynthia roretzi) found that their determinative development is highly robust to two types of cell death, mimicking environmental or genetic disturbances. The robustness is explained by multiple nonrandom features of the cell lineages, including shallow depth, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types. Simple simulations suggest that this characteristic could have arisen as an adaptation to certain disturbances in ontogenesis. This reveals general organizing principles of determinative developmental cell lineages and a conceptually new mechanism of phenotypic robustness, which have important implications for development and evolution.
EmbryoPhenomics is a high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos, consisting of an open-source video microscope (OpenVIM) and a Python package, Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV), for high-dimensional measurement of phenomic traits from video data sets. This platform enables the quantification and integration of interindividual and intraindividual temporal change in morphological, physiological, and behavioural traits with high resolution and to an unprecedented scale in a largely automated workflow. EmbryoPhenomics was demonstrated to be effective in quantifying integrated organismal responses to environmental change, using experiments assessing chronic, acute, and interactive effects of environmental stressors in two ecologically important species with different patterns of development: Radix balthica, a freshwater gastropod mollusc, and Orchestia gammarellus, a marine amphipod crustacean. OpenVIM can acquire images of large numbers of developing embryos at different temporal scales and the resultant image sequence time series can be used to visualize short-term changes in the physiology and behavior of embryos in real time throughout the course of an experiment and longer-term changes in form and function through ontogeny. EmbryoCV performs analysis and extraction of data from every image sequence acquired and these are integrated to form data sets that include morphological, behavioural, physiological, and proxy measurements. Proxy measurements include the measurement of mean pixel intensities at multiple resolutions within each frame of an image sequence to form time series signals that are subsequently analyzed to quantify energy within different temporal frequency bins. These proxy traits can be used for quantification of both holistic (lethal and sublethal classification) and specific measures (quantification and modelling of cardiac rates) of embryo health and physiology. The accuracies of measurements made by EmbryoCV were assessed via comparison with manual quantification of spatial and temporal traits equivalent to the measurements performed by EmbryoCV in a randomized subset of images from each experiment. Concordance between measurements made manually and those made by EmbryoCV was high for both spatial and temporal measurements. The EmbryoPhenomics platform can quantify integrated organismal responses to environmental change, and the resultant data can be used to model and understand the effects of different environmental factors on embryonic development. This platform has the potential to be a valuable tool for studying embryonic development and the effects of environmental change on this process.
Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, is a significant public health problem with over 214 million cases and 438,000 deaths annually. While artemisinin-based combination therapies have been effective in reducing cases, artemisinin resistance threatens to undermine these gains. New therapeutics targeting different parasite developmental stages are needed. This study focuses on Plasmodium metabolism, specifically carbon metabolism in Plasmodium berghei, the malaria parasite responsible for rodent malaria.Glutamine serves as the predominant input into TCA metabolism in both asexual and sexual blood stages and is important for complete male gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are also essential for ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito. These findings extend our knowledge of Plasmodium metabolism and point towards possible targets for transmission-blocking intervention strategies.Glucose consumption by Plasmodium-infected RBC increases 10-fold, and these stages rely primarily on glycolysis for energy generation. Notwithstanding their dependence on glycolysis, asexual blood stages maintain a single, poorly crystalline mitochondrion and are dependent on electron transport chain (ETC) activity for the re-oxidation of inner membrane dehydrogenases and pyrimidine biosynthesis. The maintenance of the mitochondrial ETC is sustained in part by the oxidation of pyruvate and the uptake and catabolism of glutamine.In contrast to asexual blood stages, there is increasing evidence that the mosquito-infective stages of Plasmodium exhibit an increased dependence on the TCA cycle and mitochondrial metabolism. Specifically, Plasmodium gametocytes develop more complex tubular mitochondrial cristae suggestive of increased mitochondrial function. Recent genetic studies have also shown that the TCA cycle is essential for the development of P. falciparum mosquito stages, consistent with earlier work in P. berghei demonstrating that the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain are required for ookinete development and oocyst formation.Despite the essentiality of the mitochondrion, operation of the TCA cycle is not required for intra-erythrocytic growth of P. falciparum. Plasmodium spp. lack key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and all developmental stages are predicted to be dependent on the uptake of sugars. However, in contrast to the asexual blood stages, there is increasing evidence that the mosquito-infective stages of Plasmodium exhibit an increased dependence on the TCA cycle and mitochondrial metabolism. Little is known about the metabolic flexibility of different Plasmodium mosquito stages and the extent to which parasite metabolism impacts on the development of these stages in the mosquito vector. In this study, the authors utilized a combination of metabolomic and reverse genetic approaches to investigate the metabolic changes that occur in key insect stages of the experimentally tractable species P. berghei and the potential impact of these changes on parasite infection in the mosquito.They find that these stages are highly sensitive to disruptions in multiple pathways in central carbon metabolism, including the TCA cycle, the utilisation of glutamine as a carbon source, intermediary carbon metabolism and coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis. The strict dependency of these stages on multiple pathways in carbon metabolism opens new avenues for targeting parasite transmission. Understanding the metabolic differences between Plasmodium species and stages, as well as the impact of parasite metabolism on transmission, can inform the development of new transmission-blocking intervention strategies.
"The ability to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals is crucial in many biological signaling pathways, and this ability often arises from the capacity to process oscillatory signals. One common motif that underlies this signal decoding is the incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL), where an input simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output. This motif can exhibit temporal adaptation, where the system becomes desensitized to a sustained input, and this property is critical in distinguishing input signals with varying temporal profiles. This paper examines another property of IFFLs - their ability to process oscillatory signals - and finds that the kinetics of the IFFL components limit the input range for which the network can decode pulsatile dynamics. Additionally, a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics is required for optimal ""counting"" of pulsatile dynamics. These findings illuminate one potential mechanism by which information processing occurs in natural networks and have implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits for this purpose. Furthermore, the paper highlights the importance of understanding how cells process oscillatory signals, as they are essential to the regulation of various cellular processes, from Ca(2+) signaling to coordination of cell fates. A systems-level approach reveals that negative feedback, often in conjunction with nonlinear reaction rates, is crucial for the generation of oscillations. While much is known about the mechanisms that generate oscillations, less is understood about how cells process these signals. In particular, how cells distinguish between oscillatory and sustained inputs and how encoded information is retrieved from the frequency and amplitude of oscillatory inputs remain open questions. Computational methods suggest one potential mechanism, where a critical frequency defines the bandwidth for high fidelity signal propagation for each network, and this capacity can be changed with an increased oscillation amplitude or with increased kinetic rates. Despite the ubiquity of oscillations in biology, much work remains to be done in understanding how cells process these signals."
Scrub typhus is a serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia, caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted through Leptotrombidium mite bites. However, research on O. tsutsugamushi's cell biology and pathogenicity lags behind other human pathogens due to its obligate intracellular nature. A study aimed to improve methods for quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of O. tsutsugamushi, including developing a standardized assay for accurate and reliable quantitative information about bacterial viability. This assay would help analyze the effects of various treatments on bacterial viability and quantify growth under different growth conditions. The researchers decided on a qPCR-based assay specific to O. tsutsugamushi's 47kDa Htra single copy gene to measure bacterial copy numbers. A single time point was chosen to represent the number of viable bacteria and the degree of intracellular growth. They validated that bacterial copy number after 7 days is roughly proportional to the number of bacteria added, establishing a single post-infection time point to accurately compare conditions for bacterial treatment and growth. This study addresses the need for improved techniques in handling O. tsutsugamushi, contributing to both cell biology research and clinical diagnostic research.
The study investigated the safety and efficacy of the anti-helminthic drug praziquantel (PZQ) in treating schistosome-infected children aged 1-5 years, a group currently excluded from schistosome control programs due to lack of safety data. The study found that PZQ treatment significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in this age group, with a 99% egg reduction rate and 92% cure rate, comparable to the efficacy in 6-10 year olds. Mild side effects were reported in 3.8% of the children, similar to those observed in older children. These findings suggest that PZQ treatment is as safe and efficacious in children aged 1-5 years as it is in older children, supporting the inclusion of younger children in schistosome control programs.Schistosomiasis is a prevalent parasitic disease in tropical and subtropical countries, affecting approximately 107 million people, with children carrying the heaviest burden of infection. Current control programs recommend regular de-worming of school-aged children, but exclude pre-school children due to lack of safety data and the belief that they have low infection rates. However, studies have shown high infection prevalence and morbidity in this age group, making them both at risk of infection and a potential reservoir for the parasite.The study was conducted in Zimbabwe, where S. haematobium is endemic, and involved 104 children aged 1-5 years and 435 children aged 6-10 years. The children were treated with PZQ and infection levels, cure rates, and side effects were compared between the two age groups. The study found that PZQ treatment significantly reduces infection levels and has similar efficacy rates in both age groups. Mild side effects were reported in 3.8% of the younger children and 13.3% of the older children, similar to those observed in previous studies.The findings of this study have important implications for schistosomiasis control programs. The inclusion of younger children in these programs is crucial for breaking the transmission cycle and reducing the overall disease burden. The safety and efficacy of PZQ in young children support its use in this age group. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term safety and impact of PZQ treatment in young children, as well as the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of including this age group in control programs.In conclusion, this study provides important data on the safety and efficacy of PZQ treatment in young children with schistosomiasis, supporting their inclusion in control programs. Further research is needed to optimize and expand these efforts to achieve sustainable control and elimination of this prevalent and debilitating disease.
Oncogenic mutations in the small GTPase Ras contribute to around 30% of human cancers, but Ras mutations alone are not sufficient for tumorigenesis. To identify cooperating cancer-relevant signaling pathways, a genome-wide, functional screen was conducted in Drosophila, revealing multiple novel, evolutionarily-conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. Human gene orthologs of the fly hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, indicating novel prognostic markers for human epithelial tumors. Of the top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary Drosophila assays, identifying many known cancer genes and multiple novel candidate genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Low expression of the confirmed hits significantly correlated with the KRASG12 mutation status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. One of the novel top 80 candidate cancer genes, the Tetraspanin family member Tsp29Fb, was mechanistically characterized and found to regulate EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrain tumor growth and invasion. This functional Drosophila screen uncovers multiple novel and evolutionarily conserved epithelial cancer genes and confirms Tsp29Fb as a key regulator of EGFR/Ras-induced epithelial tumor growth and invasion.
Meiotic drivers are alleles that manipulate gametogenesis to increase their representation in the progeny, often at the expense of other alleles. They impose a fitness cost, leading to the evolution of suppressors. Here, the wtf gene family in Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been investigated, and it was discovered that wtf13 is a meiotic driver, killing spores that do not inherit it. A diffusible poison and a spore-specific antidote are generated. Another wtf gene, wtf18-2, arising spontaneously in the lab, suppresses wtf1
A study has been conducted to predict gene expression levels in unseen human individuals based on their genetic variation using a new algorithm. The algorithm was trained using expression and genotype data of a set of individuals and tested on unseen individuals from different populations. The algorithm's predictions were found to be robust and in agreement between training and test sets. The study also showed that incorporating genomic annotations and functional features into the algorithm improved the predictions. Genes that were successfully predicted had higher expression and more variability across individuals. The algorithm can be used to predict some of the expression variation among human individuals with a low false positive rate using only their genotype data. The study also highlights the potential of using additional features such as trans-acting SNPs to further improve the predictions. Overall, the study provides a concrete means by which some of the expression variation among human individuals can be predicted with high accuracy using only their genotype data.
This study uses a dynamical-model based Bayesian inference approach to investigate the cause of competitive suppression of an avirulent clone of Plasmodium chabaudi (AS) by a virulent clone (AJ) in immuno-deficient and competent mice. The study finds that the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature RBCs needs to be clone-specific to predict the data. This difference is largest in immuno-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice, explaining why competitive suppression is alleviated in immuno-deficient mice. The study concludes that the innate immune response clearing merozoites is the most likely mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones. However, the study suggests that future refinement of the model may lead to the discovery of other competitive mechanisms. Overall, understanding the competition between strains is essential to understand the evolution of virulence and drug resistance in malarial infections.
"The ODIRA model proposes that a specific replication error can generate interstitial, inverted triplications in genomes, specifically at pre-existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats. This error involves the ligation of leading and lagging nascent strands to create ""closed"" forks, which can then form a hairpin-capped linear duplex. This duplex can then replicate in vivo to create an inverted, dimeric plasmid that can integrate into the genome, creating an inverted triplication without loss of distal chromosomal sequences. The authors test this model using in vitro and in vivo approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find support for the proposed replication error and its downstream consequences on chromosome structure. The ODIRA model can also explain the generation of human de novo inverted amplicons, making it a valuable tool for understanding the origins of interstitial, inverted CNVs that are important in human health and evolution. Overall, eukaryotic genomes are surprisingly plastic, and various mechanisms, including homologous and non-homologous recombinational events, errors in replication, and models such as ODIRA, contribute to this plasticity."
The article discusses the role of alternative translation initiation in the response of mammalian cells to stress, specifically in the context of viral infection and the anti-viral response. The authors use influenza virus as a model system to study this phenomenon and find that viral infection and the anti-viral response alter sites of translation initiation, leading to the production of novel immune epitopes. Specifically, the authors identify a truncated version of the viral neuraminidase protein that is expressed on the cell surface during influenza virus infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. The authors also find that the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites. Additionally, the authors perform evolutionary analyses and find evidence for selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza virus lineages that have adapted to mammalian hosts. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of alternative translation initiation in the cellular response to viral infection and highlights the evolutionary forces that shape this process.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, including Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), can cause foodborne diseases with significant economic and health burden, such as severe bloody diarrhea and kidney disease. EHEC uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins into host cells and disrupt their normal function, leading to diarrheal disease and bacterial transmission. However, the mechanisms by which these effectors bind to host proteins and disrupt host cell functions are not fully understood. In a study, the E. coli O157:H7 nleH1 and nleH2 genes, which encode T3SS effectors, were found to bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of NF-κB transcriptional complexes. NleH1 and NleH2 co-localized with RPS3 in the cytoplasm but not in cell nuclei. The N-terminal region of both NleH1 and NleH2 was required for binding to the N-terminus of RPS3, and their binding was independent of kinase activity. NleH1, but not NleH2, reduced the nuclear abundance of RPS3 without altering the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits or affecting the phosphorylation state or abundance of the inhibitory NF-κB chaperone IκBα. NleH1 repressed the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, but not RPS3-independent reporters. In contrast, NleH2 stimulated RPS3-dependent transcription, as well as an AP-1-dependent reporter. These findings suggest that NleH may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial effector-mediated disruption of host innate immunity.
The paper presents a new probabilistic method called Feature Motif Models (FMMs) for modeling transcription factor (TF)-DNA interactions, which uses sequence features to represent TF binding specificities, where each feature may span multiple positions. The authors develop the mathematical formulation of the model and devise an algorithm for learning its structural features from binding site data. They also develop a discriminative motif finder, which discovers de novo FMMs that are enriched in target sets of sequences compared to background sets. They evaluate their approach on synthetic data and on the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harbison et al., and show that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs. The authors apply their algorithm to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human and reveal sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. The FMM learning and motif finder software are available at <http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/>.Precise control of gene expression lies at the heart of nearly all biological processes, and much effort has been devoted to detecting TF-DNA binding specificities using traditional methodologies and high-throughput technologies. However, distilling the TF binding specificity from these assays remains a great challenge. The most common computational approaches start by defining sets of genes that are potentially coregulated and then attempt to identify regulatory elements by searching for common motifs in the promoter regions of the genes in each group. Recently, Eden et al. developed a discriminative motif finder that is well suited for finding motifs in a ChIP-chip experiment. Their method combines the search for a cutoff that defines the positive set with the search for a motif that discriminates the positive set from the rest of the chip probes.The paper by Peer et al. focuses on the limitation of the PSSM representation, which assumes that the binding specificities of TFs are position-independent, and proposes a novel approach called feature motif models (FMMs) for modeling TFBS motifs. The approach is based on describing the set of sequence properties, or features, that are relevant to the TF-DNA interactions. Each feature is assigned a statistical weight, representing the degree of its importance to the TF-DNA interaction, and the overall strength of a TFBS can then be computed by summing the contribution of all of its constituent features. The authors argue that this formulation captures the essence of the TF-DNA interaction more explicitly than PSSMs and other previous approaches. They also show that their approach can naturally represent complex and distant dependencies efficiently, thereby overcoming a limitation of other models that have been proposed.The authors validate their approach by learning FMMs from synthetic and real aligned TFBS data, and devise a novel motif finder algorithm that finds motifs in a set of unaligned sequences. They demonstrate the benefits of using FMMs instead of PSSMs as a basic building block of a motif finder, which represents TF binding motifs. Finally, they present insights that they gained from learning FMMs for two human TFs, CTCF and c-MYC.In summary, the paper presents a novel probabilistic method for modeling TF-DNA interactions, which uses sequence features to represent TF binding specificities, and show that it explains TF binding significantly better than PSSMs. The FMM learning and motif finder software are available to the research community, which could help to reveal sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of TFs in mouse and human.
The adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C) is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system, and its expression is lower in humans and chimpanzees than in other primates. This difference is due to positive selection for regulatory changes in the gene during chicken domestication and a decrease in neuronal expression in humans and chimpanzees. This decrease in expression is due to the presence of repressive histone modification and DNA methylation in the gene's promoter region. Additionally, two variants (DHS2.v1 and DHS2.v2) within a binding motif for neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) have been found to increase binding affinity and repress ADRA2C expression. These variants are fixed or near-fixed in the present-day human population, and are predicted to increase binding affinity for NRSF. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing experiments have shown that these genomic regions possess enhancer activity that is significantly lower with the derived allele than with the ancestral allele. The derived sequences are fixed or near-fixed at both sites in the present-day human population. Additionally, there is evidence of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans, indicated by low levels of nucleotide diversity, negative Tajima's D values, and strong integrated haplotype score (iHS) signals at the DHS2 locus. These findings suggest that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.
The C4 photosynthetic pathway, which has evolved independently over 60 times in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, is a remarkable example of convergent evolution. It increases productivity by approximately 50% in tropical and subtropical areas through alterations to leaf anatomy, cell biology, and biochemistry. A recent study used a new informatics framework to compare gene expression in two independent C4 lineages, Cleome gynandra and Zea mays, whose last common ancestor diverged 140 million years ago. The study found a core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation that is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of the monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Additionally, homologous transcription factors are used to induce C4 photosynthesis and maintain the cell-specific gene expression required for the pathway to operate in both species. These findings suggest that deep evolutionary comparisons of gene expression can reveal novel insights into the molecular convergence of highly complex phenotypes and that parallel evolution of trans-factors underpins the repeated appearance of C4 photosynthesis. This has implications for identifying regulators and targeting transcription factors shared by independent C4 lineages for engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice.
In 2013-2016, an unprecedented epidemic of Ebola virus (EBOV) occurred in West Africa, with cases spreading to Europe and North America. A case study of a Health Care Worker (HCW) infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone and treated in Italy provides insights into the virus's behavior in the respiratory tract. Longitudinal analysis of the HCW's samples showed that EBOV's positive and negative RNA persisted in the lower respiratory tract even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting local replication. This study, published in the journal Viruses, highlights the need for further investigation to understand the clinical significance of EBOV replication and shedding in the respiratory tract and its potential role in human-to-human transmission.EBOV, a negative-sense RNA virus, caused the largest viral hemorrhagic fever epidemic in West Africa from December 2013 to January 2016. The virus spread to Europe and North America, and several patients received care in these regions. In particular, two patients were treated at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) in Rome, Italy. The second patient, a HCW who worked in a treatment center in Sierra Leone, presented with fever, cough, and a delayed febrile thrombocytopenic syndrome with pericardial effusion. Chest X-ray revealed basal mild interstitial lung involvement.The study compared the levels of EBOV negative sense genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and positive sense RNA (pos-RNA), including both mRNAs and antigenomic RNAs, as indicators of viral replication in clinical samples from the HCW. The results showed that EBOV viremia peaked in the first days of hospital admission and declined after the administration of Mil77. However, total EBOV RNA in sputum peaked at day 6 and remained high up to day 9. Neg-RNA and pos-RNA were present in sputum samples at concentrations 2-3 Log higher than neg-RNA and pos-RNA values in plasma.The study's findings have implications for understanding the potential role of the respiratory compartment in EBOV replication in humans. The authors suggest that further investigation is needed to understand the clinical significance of EBOV replication and shedding in the respiratory tract and its potential role in human-to-human transmission. It is crucial to continue studying EBOV replication and shedding in different body compartments to develop effective intervention strategies and understand the virus's transmission dynamics fully.
A study was conducted to investigate the role of different domains of the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) of Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of Junin virus (JUNV) in the attenuation of Machupo virus (MACV), a related virus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Previously, a recombinant MACV (rMACV) with the glycoprotein of Cd#1 (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) was found to be attenuated and protective in mice. In this study, several rMACVs expressing different domains of Cd#1 GPC were rescued and characterized. The rMACVs displayed different levels of attenuation and immunogenicity in mice. The results suggest that each domain of GPC plays an indispensable role in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of effective vaccines and treatments for arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers.
Centromeric histone 3 variant, CENH3, is crucial for sister chromatid segregation during mitosis and meiosis. A study aimed to understand CENH3 functional constraints by complementing a null allele in Arabidopsis with various mutant alleles, each inducing a single amino acid change in conserved residues of the histone fold domain. Many transgenic missense lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-pollination but exhibited post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. This failure of centromeres marked by these missense mutations in the histone fold domain of CENH3 resembles the genome elimination syndromes described with chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species. A single point mutation is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, providing a simple one-step method for identifying non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species. This method's simplicity and non-transgenic nature make it an attractive tool for haploid production in crops, which could accelerate trait mapping and plant breeding.
The role of alternative splicing in self-renewal, pluripotency, and tissue lineage specification of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is largely unknown. To address this, researchers modified the H9 hESC line to allow for the selection of pluripotent hESCs and cardiac progenitors using neomycin and puromycin resistance, respectively. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns. These splice events corresponded to the pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control, as well as genes with serine/threonine kinase and helicase activity. A new program, AltAnalyze, was used to identify novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These changes included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and that promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. The findings suggest potential mechanisms that may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation.
Trehalose, a disaccharide found in various organisms, is crucial for the viability and virulence of several fungal, helminthic, and bacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). This pathogen has three potential pathways for trehalose biosynthesis: OtsA-OtsB2, TreY-TreZ, and TreS. However, only the OtsA-OtsB2 and TreY-TreZ pathways are involved in trehalose production, with the OtsA-OtsB2 pathway being the dominant one. In this pathway, trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase OtsA generates T6P from glucose-6-phosphate and ADP/UDP-glucose, which is then dephosphorylated by T6P phosphatase OtsB2 into trehalose.OtsB2 is essential for M. tuberculosis growth, and its inhibition leads to T6P accumulation, which is toxic and triggers self-poisoning of cells. This accumulation upregulates more than 800 genes, primarily due to increased RNA stability from enhanced neutralization of toxins with ribonuclease activity. Blocking T6P production in a ΔotsA mutant eliminates OtsB2 essentiality. OtsB2's role in virulence has been shown in various pathogens, although it is not strictly required for viability in normal in vitro culture conditions like other organisms. In M. tuberculosis, a conditional otsB2 mutant was generated to assess the viability in a mouse infection model and the basis of OtsB2 essentiality.To test otsB2 essentiality, gene deletion was attempted in both wild-type and merodiploid strains. While the endogenous otsB2 gene was easily deleted in the merodiploid strain, gene deletion in the wild-type strain was unsuccessful, confirming otsB2's genetic essentiality. A conditional gene silencing system was then developed, resulting in a conditional mutant (c-otsB2-tet-on mutant) whose growth was strictly dependent on the presence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc). Silencing OtsB2 in this mutant resulted in a moderate killing of approximately 1.5 logs within 7 days. Trehalose supplementation could not prevent growth inhibition upon otsB2 silencing, proving that the lack of the pathway end product is not the basis of OtsB2 essentiality.T6P accumulation during otsB2 silencing was found to be toxic for M. tuberculosis, and inactivating the T6P synthase gene otsA in M. tuberculosis and generating an unmarked gene deletion mutant (ΔotsA (u)) abolished otsB2 essentiality. Exogenous T6P did not cause growth inhibition of M. tuberculosis WT or aggravate growth inhibition of the c-otsB2-tet-on mutant at low ATc concentrations. Deletion of the T6P phosphatase gene in various yeasts and filamentous fungi results in T6P accumulation; however, these fungal mutants could tolerate this phosphosugar relatively well and remained viable, unlike M. tuberculosis.
Chagas' disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11-18 million people, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and currently has limited treatments available. A promising new target for chemotherapeutic intervention is the essential T. cruzi proline racemase enzyme (TcPR), which catalyzes the stereoinversion of L- and D-proline and is critical for the intracellular differentiation of the parasite. Recent studies have shown that TcPR is also a potent host B-cell mitogen, contributing to parasite persistence and immune system evasion. The characterization of the conformational states of TcPR, which is necessary for understanding the molecular basis of the mitogenic B-cell response and developing new structure-based drug discovery, is inaccessible by standard molecular dynamics simulations. However, advanced accelerated molecular dynamics has been used to extend the effective simulation time and capture large-scale motions of functional relevance, revealing open TcPR conformations and transient binding pockets. The results of this study provide new insights for future drug discovery for Chagas' disease.
The iKO system is a versatile and efficient method for the reversible and inducible regulation of gene expression in mice, allowing for the target gene to be turned on and off at will by treating the mice with doxycycline. This system combines two genetically modified mouse lines: a KO line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. This system allows for the high-throughput, large-scale, and cost-effective production of iKO mice, and can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications. The iKO system has been successfully used in a proof-of-concept study with the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, demonstrating reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. This method addresses the common problem with traditional gene inactivation methods, where the gene of interest is usually mutated throughout the animal's life, leading to embryonic or neonatal lethality, developmental abnormalities, or compensatory adjustments that make it difficult to elucidate the function of the gene of interest.
"A study was conducted to analyze the genetic response of the placental environment to infection by two strains of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease and can be transmitted from mother to fetus. The two strains used were K98, a clone of the non-lethal myotropic CA-I strain (TcI), and VD, isolated from a case of congenital infection (TcVI). The study found that the ""Secretory Granule"" pathway was down-regulated in both infected groups, while ""Innate Immune Response"" and ""Response to Interferon-gamma"" were up-regulated in the VD infection but not in K98. Metabolic processes, transcription, and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas, while certain signaling pathways had opposite regulation in VD and K98 groups. The VD strain showed a stronger tropism to the placental organ, suggesting living parasites. The study suggests that a strong immune response, parasite genotype-dependent, is developed in the placental environment to control infection and prevent congenital transmission. Congenital infection of T. cruzi remains a public health problem, and the different genotypes of T. cruzi may play an important role in congenital infection. Further studies are needed to understand the potential role of T. cruzi genotypes on pregnancy and congenital infection."
Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes polyarthritis and rash, known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. It occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical countries, but regularly reoccurring outbreaks have been reported in northern Europe, specifically in a 7-year cycle. However, this hypothesis is based solely on reported human cases, and an objective marker for outbreaks is needed. A study was conducted to evaluate mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden. The study found that in 2002, the year of the hypothesized outbreak, there were significantly increased infection rates in both enzootic and bridge-vector mosquitoes. Sequence analysis showed that all isolates belonged to the SINV genotype I (SINV-I), and a local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years was revealed. The findings suggest that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes constitutes the most valuable outbreak marker for further scrutinizing the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks and the mechanisms behind. SINV-I and WNV are ecologically similar, and mosquito surveillance and virus detection in mosquitoes have been suggested as the most reliable and cost-effective method for early WNV outbreak detection. In northern Europe, the first cases of SINV infections were observed in 1967 in Sweden and 1974 in Finland. A seven-year cycle of human SINV infections in northern Europe has been suggested, but the reporting of SINV cases appears to vary and the regulatory change in 1995 indicates that the authorities’ demand influences the reporting. Therefore, there is a need for an objective marker of SINV activity for further studies on the periodicity of outbreaks and for understanding the causes.
The neural circuits employ various strategies to encode information, and the interaction and integration of these mechanisms are not well understood. The locust olfactory system, where dense, transiently synchronized spike trains across ensembles of antenna lobe (AL) neurons are transformed into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB), is a well-studied preparation for investigating the interaction of multiple coding mechanisms. A form of plasticity may control and tune synaptic weights of inputs to the MB to ensure the specificity of KCs' responses to familiar or meaningful odors. Plasticity at the synapses between the AL and the MB efficiently regulates the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drives the observed specificity, reliability, and expected persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing. This model makes a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses. The oscillatory activity reflected in electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) recordings has been associated with sensory processing and cognitive states in humans. The biophysical and network mechanisms underlying oscillatory activity in the brain have been well characterized and involve periodic coherent synchronization of neuronal assemblies. In the antenna lobe (AL) of the locust, oscillatory synchronization is a feature of population coding. During the presentation of an odorant, transiently synchronized, evolving ensembles of neurons are formed and together participate in the encoding of the odor. The significance of the AL's odor oscillatory coding scheme can be best understood by examining postsynaptic units that read the oscillatory output. In insects, these follower units include neurons in the mushroom body (MB), a structure known to be involved in the storage and retrieval of memory representations. A form of activity-dependent plasticity between AL and MB may provide the necessary fine-tuning for ensemble selection in the MB and enable the appropriate selection of coherent oscillatory signals, fundamental for reading the information contained across synchronized PN spike trains.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes important for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using whole-genome expression profiles from multiple organs. The study used a two-way clustering approach, and analyzed a compendium of 278 global gene-expression profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues isolated during coronary artery bypass grafting. The results showed that there are groups of functionally associated genes (rather than individual genes) of importance for CAD and these groups of genes act in isolation in each tissue or across several tissues. The study identified an atherosclerosis module (A-module) that is important for atherosclerosis development and is genetically enriched with CAD risk by 1.8-fold. The A-module, together with LDB2, merits further attention in CAD research. Mapping of the human genome has led to new technologies for studying complex diseases such as CAD from a functional genomic perspective, and these technologies, combined with systems biology analyses, will pave the way for a more detailed understanding of the complexity underlying common disorders, leading to advancements in molecular diagnostics for early identification of disease and to identify central disease pathways for therapies tailored to specific disease mechanisms.
Molecular genetic studies in the circadian model organism Synechococcus have shown that the KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock in cyanobacteria, is involved in activating and repressing its own gene transcription. During a 24-hour period, KaiC hexamers go through different phospho-states during daytime. However, it is unclear which phospho-state of KaiC promotes kaiBC expression and which opposes transcriptional activation. A recent study analyzed various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional feedback regulation by introducing a combined TTFL/PTO model. Only a particular two-loop feedback mechanism out of 32 tested was able to reproduce existing experimental observations, including the effects of knockout or overexpression of kai genes. Threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kaiBC transcription, while unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress it. The model simulations suggest that the peak expression ratio of the positive and negative component of kaiBC expression is the main factor for how the different two-loop feedback models respond to removal or overexpression of kai genes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms in cyanobacteria and may have implications for understanding similar processes in other organisms.
The study investigates the distribution of HIV-2 reservoirs in antiretroviral-naive HIV-2 infected individuals from the ANRS-CO5 cohort. The study found that HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals and was quantifiable in TTM from 4 individuals (median: 2.25 log10 copies/106 cells) but in TCM from only 1 individual (1.75 log10 copies/106 cells). HIV-2 DNA levels in PBMCs positively correlated with those in TTM (r = 0.66, p = 0.01) but not TCM. HIV-2 reactivation was observed in the cells from only 3 individuals. The CCR5 co-receptor was distributed similarly in cell populations from individuals and donors. TCM had a lower expression of CXCR6 transcripts (p = 0.002) than TTM confirmed by FACS analysis, and a higher expression of TRIM5 transcripts (p = 0.004). These findings suggest that the low HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and a limited infection of TCM associated with a lower expression of a potential alternative HIV-2 co-receptor, CXCR6 and a higher expression of a restriction factor, TRIM5. These findings shed new light on the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection, suggesting mechanisms close to those reported in other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection models.
The Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) is a neurally detailed, spiking neuron model that provides a unified explanation of various attentional effects and their underlying mechanisms in the cortex. It explains shrinking and shifting, but not amplitude changes of spatial receptive field (RF) profiles, increase of tuning curve gain without sharpening, and response gain effects in neuronal contrast-response functions. The model is implemented in spiking neurons and defines the relationship of attentional modulation across multiple cortical areas, quantitatively comparing it to physiological data and making specific, testable predictions. ARC utilizes top-down feedback signals for selective routing of attended visual stimuli in cortex, and defines this process at multiple levels, from a large scale network comprising multiple hierarchical cortical areas, to the laminar microcircuitry of cortical columns, and to the attentional modulation of single cells. The model begins with pulvinar projecting a global control signal that coarsely encodes the size and position of the attentional target to cortical control neurons. Local control signals specify the width and centre of the local Gaussian routing function for individual columns. Feedback projections from higher cortical areas terminate in layer-I upon the apical dendrites of layer-V intrinsically bursting (IB) pyramidal cells, relaying to dendrites in layer-I of the preceding area in the hierarchy and to the dendrites of nearby layer-VI pyramidal cells in the same column. Layer-V neurons determine the size of the target's representation in V4 and minimize the loss of information by having as many columns encode information from the target as possible, not more than encode the target in V1. Layer-V neurons compute the position of the target's representation in V4 and shift it to the centre of each level, taking advantage of the Gaussian sensitivity profile of visual cortical neurons. V4 columns will perform selective routing if the target spans more V1 columns or if its position is within columns of the target's centre in V4. Control neurons compute and project local control signals to visually responsive layer-IV neurons in their column, which receive inputs from a single dimension for contrast. Nonlinear dendrites gate feedforward visual signals based on local control signals, offering a significant computational advantage over classical point neuron models. Dendritic nonlinearities can be exploited to perform selective routing, significantly reducing the number of cells needed. The synaptic weights of layer-IV nonlinear dendritic subunits serve to approximate the routing function and determine the RF location from which visual signals should be selectively processed, modulating the gain of visual signals from input columns throughout its RF. The ARC model uses these computations between each level in an identical manner, employing 1400 spiking neurons per column to compute all of the described functions.
In a study of over 11,000 individuals, including both cases with atrial fibrillation (AF) and controls, no significant associations were found between AF and common genetic variants, including those located in coding regions. The study also examined the relationship between AF and rare genetic variants, but again, no significant associations were found. These findings suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the primary mechanism underlying AF, and that large sample sizes or populations enriched for large genetic effects may be necessary to identify biologically meaningful coding variation underlying AF. Future research should integrate both coding and noncoding variation, such as through whole genome sequencing, in order to better understand the genetic contributions to AF. It is important to note that the study was predominantly comprised of individuals of European ancestry, and therefore the findings may not be generalizable to other ancestral groups. Additionally, the study had limited power to assess the role of many coding variants, particularly due to the challenges of classifying missense variants as pathogenic or not. Overall, the study provides further evidence that coding variation is not a major contributor to AF in individuals of European ancestry.
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a dangerous disease caused by Echinococcus multilocularis infections, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. This paper analyzed data on human AE in Poland over the last two decades, using both registered cases and those from active field and laboratory surveillance. A total of 121 human cases of AE were detected, with 68.6% classified as confirmed, 13.2% as probable, and 18.2% as possible. The detection rate of AE has continuously increased, with cases occurring in patients aged 6-82 years (mean: 47.7 years). The sex ratio (M/F) was 0.86/1, and AE was fatal in 19% of patients (mean age at death: 54.1 years). Seventy-six cases were diagnosed in an advanced stage of the disease, and in all cases, the liver was the primary location of AE. Thirty patients had a spread of the disease to other organs. Ninety-four patients were treated with albendazole, and 73 underwent surgical operations, including 15 liver transplantations.The study indicates that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, which is the fourth country in Europe with over 120 cases detected. The results also highlight the need for a wider national program for implementing screening in the highest AE risk areas with efforts to increase public awareness of the possibility of contracting E. multilocularis and train primary care physicians in recognizing the risk of AE. Moreover, an early detection of this disease is crucial for effective treatment and reducing its fatality rate.
The study investigates the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escherichia coli and its role in regulating genes in response to changes in zinc availability. The research reveals that Zur represses gene expression by binding to two adjacent dimers that essentially encircle the core element of each of the Zur-regulated promoters. The binding is cooperative and requires a pair of asymmetric salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp49' that connect otherwise independent dimers. The study also identifies a new member of the Zur-regulon, pliG, and demonstrates its direct regulation by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner. The pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers with significantly less protein-DNA cooperativity than observed at other Zur regulon promoters. The study also finds that the number of Fur-family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly and that the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters. The research highlights the importance of zinc in colonization by both beneficial enteric bacterial species and infection by pathogenic microorganisms, and the role of metalloregulatory proteins in responding to changes in metal concentration in the immediate environment. The study provides a comprehensive view of differential expression patterns in the Zur regulon and demonstrates the predictive value of a combined structure/thermodynamic/bioinformatic approach in identifying new Zur-regulated genes.
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 2008-2009, an outbreak of RVF affected the entire Madagascar island, including the Anjozorobe district located in the Madagascar highlands. An entomological survey found no evidence of Aedes mosquitoes, which are responsible for transmitting RVF, in this area. Additionally, there was an overall low abundance of mosquitoes due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological or virological signs of infection were observed in wild terrestrial mammals, suggesting an absence of a wild RVF virus (RFVV) reservoir. However, a three-year serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed a recurrent RVFV circulation. A spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model was used to understand the key determinants of this unexpected recurrent transmission. The model incorporated a low level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. Predictions from the model satisfactorily reproduced field observations, with 84% of cattle infections attributed to vector-borne transmission, and 16% to direct transmission. These results appeared robust according to the sensitivity analysis. Interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices could be a key element for understanding RVFV circulation in this area of Madagascar highlands.
In the past century, human movement and globalization of trade have led to the establishment of invasive mosquito species in new geographic locations, with significant environmental, economic, and health consequences. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive and aggressive daytime-biting mosquito that poses a major public health threat in its expanding range. A study used 13 nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial COI sequences to understand the historical and contemporary movements of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region and characterize its population structure. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was employed to test competing historical routes of invasion of Ae. albopictus within the Southeast (SE) Asian/Australasian region. The analysis showed that Ae. albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland SE Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or SE Asia. The recent incursion into northern Australia’s Torres Strait Islands was chiefly from Indonesia. The study provides evidence of a recently colonized population (the Torres Strait Islands) that has undergone rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be the result of genetic drift or represent a secondary invasion from an unknown source. The species' genetic structure in the region tends to favor a dispersal pattern driven mostly by human movements. The study's importance lies in its more widespread sampling distribution of the species’ native range, revealing more spatial population structure than previously shown and presenting the most probable invasion history of this species in the Australasian region using ABC analysis.
This study investigated the impact of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection on the physical health and quality of life of 572 schoolchildren in Tanzania. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 58.7%, with higher intensities in girls. Most infections were light, but 16.4% of the children had heavy infections. There was no association between S. mansoni prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anemia, or liver or spleen pathology. However, infected children had a significantly lower score in emotional PedsQL, a measure of quality of life, compared to uninfected children. In multivariable regression analyses, S. mansoni infection, along with age, haemoglobin, and VO2 max, were significant predictors for emotional PedsQL. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection has a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not on physical fitness. The authors recommend refining tools to measure schistosome-related morbidity to focus on aspects of quality of life affected by the infection. Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, with over 80% of cases in the region, including 19 million cases in Tanzania. The study highlights the need for interventions to control and prevent the spread of schistosomiasis in this region.
Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by the spirochete Leptospira, with wild rodents such as the brown rat being the main reservoirs. A study was conducted to compare the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation routes to the reference intraperitoneal route during Leptospira infection in adult rats. The results showed that Leptospira infection was asymptomatic using each inoculation route and caused similar antibody production regardless of renal colonization. The observed renal colonization rates were 8 out of 8 rats, 5 out of 8 rats and 1 out of 8 rats for the intraperitoneal, mucosal and subcutaneous inoculation routes, respectively. Therefore, mucosal inoculation was found to be more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. This knowledge can help understand the infection modalities in rats and improve the investigation of infection kinetics in future studies.
Sepsis is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that can cause organ dysfunction and failure. Currently, there are limited treatment options available for sepsis, making it a significant global health concern. A new study has identified a novel role for Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in inhibiting the pro-inflammatory response during sepsis. In a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model, mice without the AnxA2 gene (anxa2-/- mice) had increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, but decreased bacterial clearance and animal survival. Additionally, AnxA2 deficiency led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-17A. The study found that cysteine 9 of AnxA2 was the most important amino acid for the regulation of ROS levels, which is responsible for elevated IL-17A levels and subsequently exaggerated inflammatory response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas9 KO strategy down-regulated inflammation and conferred protection against sepsis in anxa2-/- mice. These findings reveal a previously undemonstrated function for AnxA2 in inflammatory response in polymicrobial sepsis models via an AnxA2-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing insight into the regulation of pathophysiology of sepsis.
HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a significant role in the progression of AIDS, and the underlying mechanisms of HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are not well understood. Researchers have found that polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3 and TLR4, decrease HIV-1 infection in MDMs. However, the specific mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. In this study, researchers aimed to understand the role of TLR3 and TLR4 in suppressing HIV-1 infection in MDMs.The researchers found that poly(I:C) and LPS stimulation of MDMs suppressed infection by CCR5-using, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 and by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. However, TLR2, TLR7, or TLR9 agonists only partially reduced infection. The suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Integrated pro-viruses were readily detected in unstimulated, TLR7- and TLR9-stimulated cells, but not in TLR3- or TLR4-stimulated MDMs, suggesting an alteration of post-entry, pre-integration events.Microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed increased microRNA (miR) -155 levels in MDMs upon TLR3/4- but not TLR7-stimulation. A miR-155 specific inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly(I:C)-stimulated MDMs, while ectopic miR-155 expression remarkably diminished HIV-1 infection in primary MDMs and cell lines. Furthermore, poly(I:C)-stimulation and ectopic miR-155 expression did not alter detection of early viral RT products but both resulted in an accumulation of late RT products and in undetectable or extremely low levels of integrated pro-viruses and 2-LTR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels of several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in trafficking and/or nuclear import of pre-integration complexes (ADAM10, TNPO3, Nup153, LEDGF/p75) were found in poly(I:C)-stimulated and miR-155-transfected MDMs, and a reporter assay suggested they are authentic miR-155 targets.In conclusion, the study provides evidence that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of miR-155 in the immune response to HIV-1 infection and suggest that miR-155 may be a potential target for the development of HIV-1 therapeutics.
The growth of embryonic stems in plants, also known as hypocotyls, is influenced by external photoperiod and the internal circadian clock, with maximum growth rates occurring at specific times of the day. A study investigating the molecular mechanisms controlling this growth found that a group of plant hormone-associated genes are coexpressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal, and this expression correlates with overrepresentation of a cis-acting element (CACATG) in phytohormone gene promoters. Using circadian clock and light signaling mutants, the study showed that both internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth. The circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day, allowing for temporal integration of hormone pathways for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth regulation. This temporal integration of hormone pathways allows plants to fine-tune phytohormone responses for optimal body plan in a particular environment. Phytohormone levels vary over the course of the day, and the circadian clock and light/dark cycles interact to control daily hypocotyl growth through the activity of transcription factors such as phytochrome interacting factor 4 (PIF4) and PIF5. However, the mechanisms defining the relationship between the circadian clock, light signaling, and phytohormone-controlled growth remain unclear. Organisms have evolved circadian clocks with internal periods of about 24 hours that allow synchrony with their external environment, and plants with circadian period lengths that match that of their environment display enhanced fitness. A temporal integration of a transcriptional component of the phytohormone pathways could be part of the specificity and redundancy in how the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by maintaining light signaling during the early part of the evening, ensuring that peak phytohormone transcript abundance coincides with the end of the dark period. This findings provide a framework for understanding how seedlings transition from dark-dependent to light-dependent growth after germination and respond appropriately to both acute and long-term changes in the light environment.
RNA interference (RNAi) technologies have been suggested for insect control, including for vectors of Chagas disease such as Rhodnius prolixus. A sustainable approach for vector control involves modifying the insect microbiota to deliver RNAi molecules to the gut. In this context, Escherichia coli HT115 (DE3) expressing dsRNA for the Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT) were fed to nymphs and adult triatomine stages. RHBP is an egg protein and CAT is an antioxidant enzyme expressed in all tissues and stages. Feeding with E. coli HT115 (DE3) resulted in systemic and temporal RNAi effects. Concentrations above 3.35 × 107 CFU/mL led to significant RHBP and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and adults. Mortality rates of first instars increased by 24-30% after feeding on RHBP and CAT bacteria. Molting rates were reduced by 100% in first instars and 80% in third instars fed bacteria producing RHBP or CAT dsRNA. Oviposition was reduced by 43% (RHBP) and 84% (CAT), and embryogenesis was arrested in 16% (RHBP) and 20% (CAT) of laid eggs. Feeding females with the natural symbiont Rhodococcus rhodnii transformed to express RHBP-specific hairpin RNA reduced RHBP expression by 89% and reduced oviposition. Therefore, modifying the insect microbiota to induce systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may result in a paratransgenic strategy for sustainable vector control. Oral delivery of dsRNA has been proposed as a method to control insect pests and diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. Similar strategies have been explored for termites, fruit flies, flour beetles, pea aphids, tobacco hornworms, and honeybees, with variable efficacy, suggesting that each species and gene may behave differently. Nonetheless, these studies suggest that oral delivery of dsRNA may provide a method to control disease vectors.
Fever during pregnancy can be dangerous for both the mother and the fetus, and in the past, malaria was a leading cause of death for pregnant women in refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border. However, the incidence of malaria has been significantly reduced by artemisinin combination therapy. The causes of fever during pregnancy in these areas are not well documented, and pregnant women with fever were invited to participate in a study where they received comprehensive clinical and laboratory screens. The study found that arthropod-borne and zoonotic diseases accounted for nearly half of all febrile illnesses in pregnant women, with scrub and murine typhus being important causes of fever associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Once malaria, pyelonephritis, and acute respiratory infections were excluded, one-third of the remaining febrile infections were caused by rickettsia or leptospirosis. The study concludes that febrile pregnant women who do not have malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infections should be treated with azithromycin, which is effective against typhus and leptospirosis. A better understanding of the causes of fever in pregnancy in resource-poor populations is needed to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
A study investigating the relationship between maternal age and recombination rate in humans analyzed over 600,000 markers in a panel of 69 French-Canadian pedigrees, revealing recombination events in 195 maternal meioses. The study found a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age, particularly in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions, likely driven by chromosome-specific effects. This decline in recombination rate may increase the risk of chromosomal non-disjunction and aneuploidy in older women. These findings suggest a model where the protective effect of recombination against non-disjunction becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age for certain chromosomes.
A new experimental immunization strategy has been developed to induce innate memory in macrophages, resulting in complete protection against secondary challenge even in the absence of adaptive immune cells. This strategy involves the use of an in vivo fungal vaccine model that delivers interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which has been shown to protect against disease in vaccinated B cell-deficient mice and CD4+/CD8+ T cell-depleted mice. Further investigation revealed that protective immunity is achieved through the establishment of antigen-specific innate memory-like responses in macrophages, resulting in enhanced antigen-specific cytokine recall responses and increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with protective anti-fungal immunity. These findings highlight the potential of developing vaccines that enhance innate immune responses as a promising approach for protecting immunocompromised individuals against diseases that target this population.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) are crucial for transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in both plants and animals. In plants, different PRC components cause overlapping and unique phenotypic defects, but the molecular mechanisms determining their target specificity and functional diversity are not well understood. A recent study quantitatively compared changes of H3K27 tri-methylation in Arabidopsis mutants deprived of various key PRC components. The study found that CURLY LEAF (CLF), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates with different members of PRC1 in suppressing distinct plant developmental programs. The expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings preferentially via a non-redundant role of CLF, which specifically associates with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). In contrast, the expression of embryo development genes is repressed by PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in common with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER (SWN). This context-dependent role of CLF corresponds well with the change in H3K27me3 profiles and is associated with differential co-occupancy of binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs), including MADS box and ABA-related factors.The study suggests that different combinations of PRC members distinctively regulate different developmental programs, and their target specificity is modulated by specific TFs. The evolutionarily conserved Polycomb group proteins (PcGs) are the major epigenetic machinery regulating differentiation and development. PcGs mediate repression by establishing and maintaining epigenetic modifications surrounding target genes. In both plants and animals, PcGs are classified into two major multi-protein complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, which participate in transcriptional repression by catalyzing H3K27 tri-methylation and H2A ubiquitination, respectively. Depletion of various PcG components in plants leads to varied developmental defects, and the functional specificity of PcGs is established through several mechanisms.The majority of PcG components are ubiquitously expressed and do not have sequence-specific DNA recognition properties. Members of PcGs generally have functional redundancy and diversity, and it is difficult to distinguish the specific effect of individual members. Plants are advantageous for studying the effect of PcGs in development since most plant PcG mutants are viable, while animal development is generally vulnerable to PcG mutations. Previous efforts in genetic dissection of PcG functions provide important clues as to the specialized functions of PcG members. For example, CURLY LEAF (CLF) and SWINGER (SWN) are two highly similar enzymatic subunits of the PRC2 complex and play redundant roles in plant development as double mutants. However, this redundancy is partial, as SWN cannot rescue the phenotypic defects upon loss of CLF, including early flowering and curly leaf.Similarly, lack of either AtRING1 or AtBMI1, the core catalytic factors of PRC1, leads to depression of embryonic traits in seedlings, while only the atring1a atring1b double mutant displays severely fused flower phenotypes. Additionally, LHP1, a PRC1 component capable of interacting with both PRC1 components AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in vitro, displays some similar phenotypic defects to those of the PRC2 mutant clf and co-purifies with the PRC2 complex. Studies on different loci have led to different conclusions on the interplay between PRC1 and PRC2, including their orders of recruitment into the corresponding complexes. It seems that different PcGs tend to repress specific gene sets with distinct functions. However, target genes and the mechanisms of specificity for different PcGs are not sufficiently characterized, particularly from a genome-wide point of view.Multiple mechanisms have been proposed in Arabidopsis to explain the target specificity of PcGs, including specific recruitment of PcGs by diverse strategies for transcription repression and selective displacement of PcGs by some transcription factors for transcription de-repression during developmental transitions. However, most of these proposed mechanisms are based on studies of some specific genes without an overview
"The study focuses on the active site of RNA polymerase II, specifically the ""trigger loop"" (TL) that is crucial for substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. The researchers examined nearly all TL single variants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II using a structural genetics approach that combines structural and phenotypic data for high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and their evolution. They identified three mutant classes with distinct distributions among TL residues, associated with transcription defects or various stresses. Mutations disrupting an intra-TL hydrophobic pocket resulted in pocket disruption and increased catalysis. Genetic interactions support the contribution of the funnel and bridge helices to TL dynamics. This approach provides a framework for understanding the mechanisms of other essential yeast proteins. The TL is highly conserved, and its mutations can cause fitness defects and alterations in transcription elongation rates, making it a potential target for regulation."
Rabies is a deadly CNS disease in mammals, caused by the rabies virus (RV), a neurotropic lyssavirus from the rhabdoviridae family. RV is typically transmitted by scratches or bites from rabid animals, resulting in the dissemination of virions into skin and muscle tissue. After initial infection of cells at the infection site, RV enters axon terminals and migrates by retrograde axonal transport into the CNS, where it causes a lethal encephalopathy. The incubation period can vary from days to years. While it is known that RV spreads from the infection site to the CNS via retrograde transport within the neuronal network, a potential hematogenous spread from the site of infection directly to the brain after accidental spill over into the vascular system has been suggested but its relevance is unknown. To investigate this, mice were inoculated with the dog-associated RV DOG4 or the silver-haired bat-associated RV SB, either intramuscularly or intravenously. The progression of clinical signs of rabies and the spread of the virus from the infection site to the brain were monitored using immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for the post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat-associated RV.
The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans, with notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. A study using 71 complete genome sequences of H1N1 viruses from 1918 to 2006 found that segmental reassortment has played an important role in its genomic evolution. Specifically, an H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may also have been associated with reassortant H1N1 viruses. Therefore, intra-subtype reassortment appears to be a more significant process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized. The H1N1 subtype has had a significant epidemiological impact in humans, with the most debated evolutionary question being how and from where A/H1N1 emerged in such a virulent form in 1918 and caused the global influenza pandemic. Following the 1918 pandemic, the A/H1N1 influenza virus continued to circulate in humans, causing seasonal epidemics of varying severity, and also in swine as 'classical' swine influenza. However, the evolutionary and epidemiological processes that precipitated extensive divergence in the A/H1N1 virus are unclear, as are the mechanisms that dictate the cyclical interplay between the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes in humans. Understanding the role of segmental reassortment in the evolution of A/H1N1 is also unclear, as it is well established that reassortment between influenza isolates from different host species can generate viruses with pandemic potential. Further research is needed to fully understand the evolutionary history and epidemiological impact of the H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus.
Nicotine, a highly addictive drug, exerts its reinforcing action by stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and increasing dopamine (DA) output from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The principal pathway of nicotine action has been debated, with two main theories: direct stimulation of DAergic cells through nAChR activation, or disinhibition mediated through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons. A computational model was used to investigate this issue, illustrating that both α4β2-containing nAChRs on DA or GABA cells can mediate nicotine's acute effects. The model accounts for in vitro and in vivo data, predicting the conditions necessary for either direct stimulation or disinhibition to increase DA activity.The VTA is a key dopaminergic structure involved in reward, motivation, and drug-reinforced behavior. Nicotine stimulates nAChRs in the VTA, boosting DA output to targets like the nucleus accumbens, playing a critical role in the mediation of nicotine reward and dependence. Nicotine's various subtypes of nAChRs have different activation/desensitization kinetics and distinct affinities for ACh and Nic, with α4β2 nAChRs mediating most of nicotine's evoked currents and acute reinforcing effects. The central question is whether nicotine acts directly on DA neurons or affects local GABA interneurons, influencing DA neuron inhibition.In vitro data suggest nicotine desensitizes α4β2 nAChRs, decreasing endogenous cholinergic drive to GABA neurons and disinhibiting DA cells. In vivo studies emphasize the role of nicotine-evoked direct activation of β2-containing nAChRs on DA neurons. A model was built to clarify the mechanisms linking nicotine-triggered nAChR activation/desensitization and nicotine control of DA signaling. The results show that each mechanism, direct excitation and disinhibition, requires distinct conditions for afferent input strengths and cellular properties to account for the nicotine-evoked DA boost. The endogenous cholinergic input rate determines the DA response to nicotine for both mechanisms.In summary, nicotine's acute rewarding properties are mediated by the VTA through direct stimulation and disinhibition mechanisms, dependent on endogenous cholinergic input rates. The α4β2 nAChRs play a significant role in nicotine reward and dependence, with nicotine activating and desensitizing α4β2 but not α7 receptors at physiologically relevant concentrations. The model provides a foundation for understanding nicotine's addictive effects, offering potential strategies for developing smoking cessation treatments.
The study is a two-armed, randomized, double-blinded, phase IIa trial conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan, from 2004 to 2008, involving patients with anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) caused by Leishmania (L.) tropica infection. The trial aimed to evaluate a novel therapeutic concept to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve the cosmetic outcome of ACL. The patients were divided into two groups, with group I receiving bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel and pharmaceutical sodium chlorite (DAC N-055), and group II receiving EC and MWT with only polyacrylate hydrogel. The primary outcome was the time needed for complete lesion epithelialization, and biopsies were taken for parasitological and histopathological analyses. The mean duration for complete wound closure was short and indifferent in both groups. DAC N-055 caused a more rapid wound epithelialization in patients with Leishmania-positive biopsies. The rate of superinfections and reulcerations were similar in both groups. DAC N-055 showed a leishmanicidal effect on pro- and amastigotes. The EC plus MWT protocol led to more rapid wound closure compared to previous results with intralesional antimony injections. The tentatively lower rate of relapses and the acceleration of wound closure in a subgroup of patients with parasite persistence warrant further studies on the activity of DAC N-055. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00947362.
A genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells was conducted to identify factors that influence RAS/MAPK signaling. The screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, including most previously known factors associated with this pathway. Epistasis experiments revealed several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway and influencing MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors and regulate mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events but also on the regulation of MAPK levels and specific splicing.
A retrospective study of 498 C. neoformans and C. gattii isolates in Thailand revealed that 386, 83, and 29 strains were from clinical, environmental, and veterinary sources, respectively. Of these, 485 C. neoformans and 13 C. gattii strains were studied. The majority of the strains (68.9%) were isolated from males, with a mean age of 37.97 years. Most of the C. neoformans clinical strains (88.5%) were from HIV positive patients, while only 37.5% of the C. gattii strains were from HIV positive patients. URA5-RFLP and/or M13 PCR-fingerprinting analysis revealed that the majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI (94.8%). Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) analysis identified a total of 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand. Most of the C. gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. Cryptococcosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, with C. neoformans being the major cause of infection in immunocompromised hosts and C. gattii in immunocompetent hosts. The ecological niches of both species are different, with C. neoformans associated with soil enriched with pigeon excreta and decaying wood, and C. gattii related to eucalyptus trees and tropical trees. However, recent studies have shown an environmental shift of C. gattii to native tree species in temperate areas such as Vancouver Island, Canada.
The evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks plays a significant role in the phenotypic variation observed across organisms. While changes to cis-regulatory elements are thought to be the primary means by which regulatory networks evolve, variations in transcription factors (TFs) have also been observed to contribute to this divergence. A study of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning 45 million years of evolution revealed that a significant fraction of all C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. These variations, including loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF domains and diverging DNA-contacting residues, were found in ~44% of domains shared between D. melanogaster and other fly species. These diverging DNA-contacting residues, found in ~70% of the D. melanogaster C2H2-ZF genes and corresponding to ~26% of all annotated D. melanogaster TFs, show evidence of functional constraint and tend to be conserved across phylogenetic clades, indicating their rapid fixation and importance in regulation. These variations gradually change the predicted specificities of these dynamic domains across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those with varying domains exhibit no functional enrichments, suggesting that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans.
A study developed and validated serotype-specific PCR assays using CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) as a target to accelerate the diagnosis of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A. The serotype-specific PCR assays were 100% sensitive and specific, tested on a large collection of strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins, and time periods, as well as on other bacterial populations producing similar clinical symptoms. The assays were developed for use with DNA from cultured isolates but could be modified for use with clinical and other samples. The need for these assays is critical as typhoid and paratyphoid fevers remain a major health problem in the developing world, with millions of illnesses and deaths each year. Early and accurate identification of the causal agents is essential for appropriate antimicrobial therapy, prevalence and monitoring studies, and the implementation and evaluation of health policies.
In this study, the role of Notch receptors in Th1 cell differentiation and resolution of Leishmania major infection was investigated using mice with T cell-specific ablation of Notch1, Notch2, or both receptors on a resistant C57BL/6 genetic background. The results showed that Notch signaling through either N1 and/or N2 induces the secretion of IFNγ by CD4+ Th1 cells, and this differentiation is mainly driven by non-canonical (RBP-Jκ-independent) Notch signaling. Specifically, mice with double inactivation of N1 or N2 in their T cells were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 immune response, whereas mice with both N1 and N2 inactivated (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) were unable to heal their lesions, failed to control parasite load, and had abrogated IFNγ secretion by CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, in the absence of Notch expression on T cells, while preventing IFNγ secretion, favored the development of IL-13- and IL-5-secreting cells. These findings suggest that Notch signaling is crucial for the generation of IFNγ-secreting Th1 cells required to mount an efficient immune response against L. major infection, and RBP-Jκ-independent Notch signaling plays a critical role in this process.
In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1/AIDS disproportionately affects individuals, who also have a high prevalence of helminthic parasite infections. A study was conducted to determine if parasitic worm infection increases the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. Rhesus monkeys were infected with Schistosoma mansoni and challenged intrarectally with decreasing doses of R5-tropic clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C). The results showed that parasitized monkeys had a 17-fold lower 50% animal infectious dose of SHIV-C compared to controls (P<0.001). Coinfected animals also had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads (P<0.001) and increased viral replication in CD4+ central memory cells (P=0.03). These findings suggest that acute schistosomiasis significantly increases the risk of de novo AIDS virus acquisition, and controlling helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to decrease the spread of HIV-1. This study provides the first direct evidence in a relevant in vivo model that pre-existing infection with parasitic worms facilitates systemic infection after mucosal AIDS virus exposure. The magnitude of the effect suggests that control of helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV-1.
The paper investigates the role of Acetylcholine (ACh) in determining patterns of cortical activity and functional differences arising from these patterns. The study focuses on the impact of ACh on neural excitability and network structure, resulting in three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous. These regimes may have profound functional significance, with stationary patterns potentially playing a role in memory encoding and traveling waves leading to synaptic regularization. Cortical activity differs significantly during slow wave sleep (SWS), REM sleep, and waking states. ACh levels are a key factor in these dynamic patterns. High ACh levels, as seen in waking and REM sleep, are associated with localized cortical dynamics and high-frequency, low-amplitude EEG and LFP recordings. During SWS, characterized by low ACh levels, cortical population dynamics enter a slow (~1 Hz) oscillation state, with individual neurons alternating between a high-frequency (up) state and periods of quiescence (down state).A Hodgkin-Huxley type network model is used to demonstrate how ACh regulation can account for dynamical changes between functional regimes. Reducing the magnitude of the M-current, which is regulated by ACh, recreates the reduction in SFA and the shift from a type 2 to a type 1 PRC observed in the presence of ACh. The level of ACh also determines how sensitive network activity is to synaptic heterogeneity.In summary, ACh plays a crucial role in determining cortical activity patterns by modulating neural excitability and network structure. The differences in cortical activity patterns during waking, REM, and SWS are primarily due to ACh level variations. High ACh levels are associated with localized cortical dynamics, while low ACh levels during SWS result in slow oscillation dynamics. The model presented in the paper elucidates the complex interaction between ACh modulation, network connectivity structure, and spatio-temporal dynamics, providing valuable insights into the role of ACh in cortical activity patterns and functional differences.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a type of cancer that development in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. Researchers hypothesized that mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, which is a key component of the innate immune system, could be disrupting innate immune signaling and promoting a microenvironment that favors tumorigenesis. They found that non-synonymous mutations affecting the TLR pathway were present in 14.6% of EAC tumors, and that these mutations were associated with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease. The researchers also found that TLR4, a gene in the TLR pathway, was the most frequently mutated gene, and that these mutations resulted in impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and decreased responsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. These findings suggest that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in EAC, and that TLR4 mutations may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients. Additionally, the researchers found that TLR pathway mutations were also frequent in other types of solid tumors, including uterine endometrioid carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma.
The sense of taste is crucial for animal survival, allowing them to identify nutritious food and avoid toxic substances. While the molecular mechanisms of taste signal transduction have been studied extensively, the ontogeny of taste cells is still not well understood. In this study, researchers used a combination of in silico and in vivo analyses to investigate the molecular regulation of taste system development in mice. They found that TRCSMs, which are required for sweet/bitter/umami taste signal transduction, colocalized within developing circumvallate papillae (CVP). Further analysis revealed that Hes1 is likely to play a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds. The researchers discovered that Hes1, a basic helix-loop-helix type of transcription factor, emerged as the most likely candidate for regulating taste stem cells or precursor cells. These findings suggest that HES1 is commonly expressed in precursor cells involved in the cell type differentiation pathway within CVP and that Hes1 activity is required in the precursor or stem cell population in taste system development. The research also highlights the importance of further study in the role of Hes1 during development of the taste recognition system in vivo. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular regulation of taste system development and has the potential to lead to a better understanding of the process of taste cell differentiation and the development of therapies for taste disorders.
Rice is a vital monocot crop worldwide, differing from the dicot Arabidopsis in many aspects, including ethylene and auxin interaction in root growth regulation. In rice, ethylene inhibits root elongation via a YUC-based auxin biosynthesis pathway. Ethylene promotes the expression of YUC8/REIN7, a member of the YUC gene family involved in the conversion of IPA to IAA in auxin biosynthesis and root growth. This interaction is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice. A study investigated the ethylene double response (promotion of coleoptile growth and inhibition of root elongation) in etiolated rice seedlings of three japonica and three indica cultivars. The results showed that all genotypes exhibited increased coleoptile growth and inhibited root elongation, suggesting that the ethylene double response is common in etiolated rice seedlings. The ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor 1-aminoethoxyvinyl-glycine (AVG) and ethylene competitive inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) were used to determine whether ethylene biosynthesis or signaling is involved in this process. The 1-MCP, but not AVG, suppressed the ethylene response of etiolated japonica and indica seedlings, indicating that ethylene-promoted coleoptile growth and ethylene-inhibited root elongation are primarily mediated by the ethylene signaling pathway. To identify the factors involved in ethylene-inhibited root elongation, a screen for ethylene-insensitive mutants was conducted from mutagenesis and T-DNA insertion libraries in rice. At least seven rice ethylene-insensitive (rein) mutants were selected based on the phenotypes of the roots and coleoptile of etiolated seedlings. The rein7-1 confers salt adaptation without compromising yield, and the rein7-2 has a phenotype of curled leaves. Sequence analysis suggests that REIN7 encodes a 421 amino acid protein containing two conserved sequence motifs, the FAD-binding motif and NADPH-binding motif, and is a flavin-containing monooxygenase. REIN7 corresponds to YUC8, belonging to the same group as rice YUC1 and Arabidopsis YUC1 and YUC4. The ethylene response assays showed that the altered ethylene responsiveness of rein7-1 was rescued in the transgenic plants, indicating that YUC8/REIN7 is located at the Os03g0162000 locus. The transgenic seedlings exhibited enhanced ethylene response phenotypes in roots compared with those of the wild-type seedlings, further demonstrating that YUC8/REIN7 is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. In conclusion, ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice is mainly dependent on YUC activity-based auxin biosynthesis, and YUC5, YUC8, and YUC11 may be involved in ethylene-inhibited root elongation. The C-terminal region of YUC8/REIN7 is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. YUC8/REIN7 is an auxin biosynthesis gene, and the C-terminus is important for its function.
There has been a global increase in the incidences of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases. A nationwide systematic epidemiological study was conducted in Saudi Arabia for the first time to analyze the trend of NTM diseases in the country. A total of 527 NTM isolates were collected from different provincial laboratories over a period of 24 months. The isolates were identified using line probe assays and sequencing of 16S rRNA, 16S-23S ITS region, rpoB and hsp65 genes. The laboratory findings were comprehensively analyzed against demographical and clinical data. The results showed a higher proportion of Saudi citizens, elderly (>60 years) patients, and male gender. Overall, 75.1% isolates were of pulmonary origin with a proven clinical significance of 44.7%. A total of 34 NTM species, including 17 rare species, were identified. M. simiae, M. fortuitum and M. abscessus were the predominant species. Twenty-seven new cases of clinically relevant M. riyadhense were also noticed. Diabetes mellitus and previous history of tuberculosis were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. The study highlights the need for more priorities to be given to NTM’s and the development of diagnostic infrastructures and disease management plans in Saudi Arabia.
In studying the molecular determinants of quiescence and lifespan extension in yeast, researchers utilized starvation-specific gene reporters to screen a subset of the yeast deletion library. They found that the SNF1/AMPK complex, the cell wall integrity pathway, and several cell cycle regulators, in addition to previously characterized kinases, are necessary for proper quiescence establishment and lifespan extension. The correlation between the chronological lifespan (CLS) of these signaling mutants and their storage carbohydrate levels, but not their transition-phase cell cycle status, was highlighted. The study also revealed that Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1 kinases cooperatively control intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and mediate the TOR1-regulated accumulation of storage carbohydrates and CLS extension. These findings support the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming to accumulate energy stores and the activation of anti-oxidant defense systems are coordinated by these kinases to ensure quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast.Parallel research in invertebrates and rodents has shown that dietary interventions mimicking calorie restriction or mutations in nutrient and growth signaling pathways can increase longevity by 30-50%, accompanied by reduced or delayed morbidity. The TOR pathway, which regulates lifespan across various organisms, has been identified as a key regulator of aging. In yeast, down-regulation of TOR activity extends both replicative lifespan (RLS) and CLS. The study discusses possible mechanisms for CLS extension in yeast, including enhanced mitochondrial respiration, mtROS-activated hormesis, and Rim15-dependent epigenetic silencing at subtelomeric heterochromatin. Moreover, the study highlights the role of Fkh1, Fkh2, and the anaphase-promoting complex in CLS regulation.In summary, the molecular determinants of quiescence and lifespan extension involve a complex interplay of signaling pathways and kinases, such as SNF1/AMPK, TOR, and Rim15, along with cell cycle regulators and metabolic enzymes. These factors work in concert to regulate storage carbohydrate accumulation, reactive oxygen species levels, and stress response, ultimately contributing to the survival and longevity of yeast cells under nutrient-limited conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of aging and stress response that could potentially be applied to higher organisms, including humans.
Influenza A virus (IAV) persists in human populations by continuously evolving to escape herd immunity, with protective immunity predominantly mediated by neutralizing antibodies (Abs) specific for the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA). A study by Zhou et al. utilized the primerID method of error-correcting viral population sequencing to reveal an unexpected role for hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation in compensating for fitness defects resulting from escape from anti-HA neutralizing antibodies. The research found that antibody-free propagation following antigenic escape rapidly selected viruses with mutations that modulated receptor binding avidity through the addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain. These findings expand understanding of the viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigenic evolution to include glycan addition, highlighting the immense power of high-definition virus population sequencing to reveal novel viral adaptive mechanisms.The ability of viruses to exploit these escape routes is limited by their costs to viral fitness. The sialic acid receptor binding site is nestled among the immunodominant antigenic sites, and escape substitutions often alter viral fitness by changing HA receptor binding avidity. Amino acid substitutions that change the net charge of the globular domain typically alter cell binding avidity. The research demonstrates that glycosylation can also compensate for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions elsewhere on HA, thus increasing the viability and subsequent emergence potential of Ab-escape variants.The researchers generated a recombinant PR8 clone carrying the consensus SV12 HA gene segment and compared the ability of WT PR8 and the consensus SV12 clone to replicate in eggs. Antigenic escape substitutions present within SV12 HA imposed significant fitness costs when the virus population had limited time to recover fitness via mutational compensation. Compensatory mutations that increased the fitness of SV12 may not have been identified with conventional Sanger sequencing if multiple variants were selected that collectively were a significant proportion of the population but that individually remained below the wild-type SV12 consensus frequency at each codon.In conclusion, the study reveals a novel role for glycosylation in viral immune evasion, independent of its well-known steric effects on epitope shielding. The research demonstrates that glycan addition can also play the opposite role during antigenic drift: increasing the fitness of antigenic escape variants by restoring optimal HA receptor interactions, even in the absence of antibody selective pressure. These findings highlight the self-perpetuating nature of HA antigenic evolution and have important implications for designing more effective vaccines and therapeutics.
The prolongation of the cardiac action potential (AP) is a strategy used in antiarrhythmic drugs, but its outcomes have been controversial. While increasing AP duration (APD) should inhibit pathological re-entry of excitation, prolonged APD has been linked to increased ventricular arrhythmias. Reverse rate dependence (RRD), where drugs prolong the APD more at slower heart rates, is an undesirable property of Class III antiarrhythmics as it weakens their ability to suppress re-entrant tachyarrhythmias and increases proarrhythmic potential. Forward rate dependence (FRD), prolonging the APD at fast heart rates but minimally at slow heart rates, is the ideal property for class III agents. However, FRD agents have remained elusive, and RRD behavior is not unique to IKr-block, but occurs with multiple perturbations affecting the APD. A study analyzed ventricular myocyte models and found that while ventricular cell models often display reverse rate dependence, a variety of ionic current perturbations do produce the desired forward rate dependence. These perturbations provide potential drug targets for FRD APD prolongation, and simulations of these perturbations provide insight into how FRD behavior can be produced. The study highlights the importance of rate-dependent changes in AP shape in determining a myocyte's capacity for forward versus reverse rate dependence. Overall, the study provides new insight into the determinants of APD rate dependence and illustrates a strategy for the design of potentially beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs.
A study was conducted to develop methods for PheWAS (Phenome-Wide Association Studies) based on ICD-10 codes and biological test results, and to test the approach on thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. Two aggregation methods were developed for ICD-10 codes, and eleven biological test results were analyzed using discretization algorithms. The study included 442 patient records with 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. The results showed that iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with very high TPMT activity. The study demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of performing a PheWAS on a quantitative trait, and the consistency in the results found between the two aggregation methods. The use of ICD-10 codes and biological test results allowed for the discovery of new potential associations between TPMTa related to thiopurine treatment and clinical data. Overall, the study highlights the potential of PheWAS in pharmacogenomics for identifying new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition with high morbidity and mortality for which no treatments are currently available. Stem cell therapy has shown promise in the restoration of neurological function in SCI. A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression study was conducted to examine the impact of stem cell biology and experimental design on motor and sensory outcomes following stem cell treatments in animal models of SCI. The study analyzed 156 publications using 45 different stem cell preparations, with the majority utilizing allogeneic stem cell treatment. The results indicated that allogeneic stem cell treatment improved both motor and sensory outcomes. Differentiation before implantation and intravenous route of delivery favored better sensory outcomes. However, stem cell implantation did not appear to improve sensory outcome in female animals and appeared to be enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. While the study suggested that stem-cell-based therapies may offer promise for traumatic SCI, the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias mean that efficacy is likely to be somewhat lower than reported. Stem cells, which can generate all tissues, have the potential to reconstitute tissues damaged by injury and disease. Stem cell transplantation has been successfully used in the treatment of cancers of the blood and bone marrow. In animal models, hepatocytes derived from stem cells have been engrafted into damaged liver, and lineage-specific stem cells have been used to repair damaged cornea. Recent studies have also demonstrated the generation of artificial tissues with key features of complex organs, including blood vessels, heart, lung, and kidney. In patients, lineage-specific stem cells have shown efficacy in the regeneration of craniofacial bones and of damaged cornea. Studies have also reported on the immunomodulatory effects of stem cells in reducing rejection of kidney transplants, corneal allografts, and composite tissue hemi-facial allografts. In the CNS, stem cells have been reported to provide immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects in models of diseases as disparate as retinopathy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord injury. A meta-analysis of data from controlled in vivo studies testing the efficacy of stem cells as a treatment in animal models of SCI found substantial between-study heterogeneity, with small study bias suggested. The findings suggest that while stem-cell-based therapies may offer promise for traumatic SCI, further research is needed to establish the optimal conditions for stem cell therapy and to address issues of internal validity and publication bias.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, including Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect over a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy, or the repeated administration of anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the main control strategy. However, this approach does not prevent reinfection. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. The study searched multiple databases and identified 51 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, A. lumbricoides prevalence reached 26% (95% CI: 16--43%), 68% (95% CI: 60--76%), and 94% (95% CI: 88--100%), respectively. For T. trichiura, respective reinfection prevalence were 36% (95% CI: 28--47%), 67% (95% CI: 42--100%), and 82% (95% CI: 62--100%). For hookworm, reinfection prevalence were 30% (95% CI: 26--34%), 55% (95% CI: 34--87%), and 57% (95% CI: 49--67%). Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. These findings suggest that STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Therefore, frequent anthelmintic drug administrations are needed to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation are needed to interrupt transmission of STH.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common metabolic disease associated with insulin-resistance syndrome and affects 25% to 45% of the general US population. NAFLD has two categories: steatosis, an accumulation of fat in the liver, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which consists of liver inflammation and hepatocellular injury with or without fibrosis. Gene deregulation, the loss of precise control over certain genes and expressed proteins, is associated with various diseases, including NAFLD. Determining which genes are deregulated and how these genes are deregulated can increase the understanding of any disease and provide new pathways for therapeutic treatments. Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) is a new method used to identify deregulated minimal networks (MiNs) by comparing two conditions using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. MiNEA can generate MiNs for any target metabolite and integrate condition- and context-specific omics data to understand the deregulated phenotypes associated with a set of differentially expressed genes. Additionally, MiNEA can identify deregulated alternative routes for a given MT between two conditions. The authors applied MiNEA to investigate deregulated MiNs and to identify key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes, such as a fatty liver and liver inflammation, in both humans and mice by integrating condition-specific transcriptomics data from liver samples. They identified key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both humans and mice and found that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice. The MiNEA algorithm can optimize whole GEMs to find minimal networks, making it easier to generalize and apply to the study of other metabolic phenotypes and diseases.
The olfactory system is responsible for identifying and discriminating odors, which is crucial for various tasks like navigating the environment or identifying food. This is complicated by the vast variety of odors and their concentrations. The olfactory bulb, part of the olfactory system, processes these signals and sends them to the olfactory cortex. While it is known that the olfactory bulb removes statistical redundancies and provides a concentration-invariant code, the specific processing methods are not yet fully understood. Primacy coding is a proposed method for encoding odors, where the identity of the odor is represented by the receptor types that respond earliest. A model of this primacy coding was analyzed, and it was found that the number of receptor types in the primacy representation greatly impacts the encoded information but the size of the receptor repertoire has a weak effect. This representation is independent of the odor intensity, and the transmitted information is useful for typical olfactory tasks. The study also found situations where a smaller receptor repertoire can be advantageous for discriminating odors and predicts how receptor arrays need to adapt to stay useful during environmental changes. Overall, primacy coding is a more useful and efficient odor representation compared to other coding methods.
The study investigates the extent of non-sigmoidal slopes that can plateau at less than 100% for HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) targeting four regions of the Env spike involved in broad neutralization. The study found that all bnMAbs were subject to inhibition curves that did not reach 100%, and most bnMAbs also had neutralization curves with non-sigmoidal slopes. BnMAbs targeting certain areas of the trimer were more prone to these effects. Primary isolate and molecular cloned viruses produced in primary cells were also incompletely neutralized, suggesting this phenomenon could be significant in vivo. The study used a panel of bnMAbs targeting different regions on Env tested in a highly quantitative pseudovirus neutralization assay on a panel of 278 viral clones. The bnMAbs were determined for the maximum percent neutralization (MPN), the percent at which the neutralization curve plateaus for those viruses neutralized with an IC50 <1μg/ml. The bnMAbs that target the high-mannose patch had the highest median MPN values, while the bnMAbs that target the V2 apex had a median MPN value of 99%. The gp41 targeting bnMAbs showed the lowest median MPN values at 93% for 4E10 and 96% for 2F5. The inability of 4E10 and 2F5 to reach 100% neutralization for their neutralization curves is inconsistent with the association of glycan heterogeneity with incomplete neutralization since these bnMAbs do not target a glycan as part of their known epitopes. The study also showed that glycans on gp120 and/or on gp41 affect the accessibility of the MPER in the context of the viral membrane. Overall, the study suggests that incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves are possible for all HIV bnMAbs against a wide range of viruses produced and assayed in both cell lines and primary cells, with implications for the use of antibodies in therapy and as tools for vaccine design.
A study used constraint-based modeling and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to understand the relationship between glucose and glutamine utilization and enhanced growth in cancer cells. A core stoichiometric model (ENGRO1) was manually reconstructed to evaluate the contribution of glucose and glutamine to biomass formation. The model includes the catabolic pathways of glucose and glutamine and the anabolic reactions necessary for the main building blocks of biomass. The network was designed to evaluate the pathways utilized by cancer cells, and reaction stoichiometry and directionality were taken from genome-wide databases. The model was used to examine the typical properties of the ensemble of theoretical wirings whose generic properties statistically match those of cancer cells. The study found that certain patterns emerged, such as the production of lactate and a decrease in the rate of the forward aconitase reaction (a proxy of the operational activity of the TCA cycle) with increasing glutamine uptake rates. Despite the high utilization of nutrients, ENGRO1 wirings on the average did not exhibit biomass production. The model correctly predicted the decrease in the ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed at low glutamine and that some glutamine is converted to lactate. The study found that the increase in the glycolytic to oxidative ATP flux ratio is not a necessary condition for growth and that reductive carboxylation of glutamine supports cell growth. A non-negligible fraction of growing cells did not show redirection of glucose to lactate, indicating a link between glutamine reductive carboxylation and the redirection of glucose to lactate. The study found that, despite identical boundary conditions, only a subset of wirings succeeded in growing and was characterized by the ability to utilize glutamine through a reverse aconitase flux and to produce lactate. These proliferative wirings were heterogeneous but shared some generic properties and were also found in a cancer cell line grown in similar nutrient conditions. The study was able to capture with a good degree of accuracy how the levels of many metabolites respond to glutamine shortage, giving support to the reliability of the ENGRO1 model and of the ensemble approach.
A study investigating the cellular environment of the prion protein (PrPC) and its paralogs, Doppel (Prnd) and Shadoo (Sho), was conducted in neuroblastoma cells. The research aimed to identify relevant interactions of these proteins and reconcile previous findings. The study confirmed direct interactions among the three prion protein family members and multiple interactions with the neural cell adhesion molecule, the laminin receptor precursor, Na/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). Further validation experiments suggested that PrPC interactions with PDIs may play a role in the accumulation of PrPSc. The hypothesis presented proposes that PrPC organizes its molecular environment due to its ability to bind to adhesion molecules harboring immunoglobulin-like domains, which in turn recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular environment of prion proteins and their interactions, contributing to the understanding of prion diseases.
In respiratory virus infections like influenza, a robust type I immune response typically occurs, but type 2 cytokines have also been observed. Type 2 cytokines are linked to asthma exacerbation, but they may also be tissue protective. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a prototypical type 2 cytokine that is essential for eosinophil maturation and egress from the bone marrow. A study using a mouse model of influenza virus infection found a transient release of IL-5 into infected airways and a significant accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase of infection. The cellular source of the IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) infiltrating the infected lungs. The expansion of c-kit+ IL-5 producing ILC2 and their interaction with IL-33 producing NKT and alveolar macrophages (AM) leads to abundant production of IL-5 and accounts for the accumulation of eosinophils observed during the recovery phase of influenza infection. IL-5 is a major type 2 cytokine that is essential for eosinophil survival and is involved in the development and severity of asthma and allergic diseases. Local production of IL-5 in the lungs during asthma exacerbation can result in pulmonary eosinophilia which can in turn enhance airway smooth muscle contraction and cause excess mucus production. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are innate immune cells that are capable of producing large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 when stimulated by IL-25 and IL-33, two cytokines associated with the type 2 response. ILC2 have been implicated in the production of IL-5 during influenza infection, which stimulates the progressive recruitment and accumulation of eosinophils in the infected lungs, particularly late in infection during the recovery phase. This increase in IL-5 production by ILC2 is in part stimulated by IL-33 produced by both alveolar macrophages (AM) and, unexpectedly, NKT cells infiltrating the IAV infected lungs.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa, but their epidemiology and clinical manifestations in Asia are not well documented. A study was conducted in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013, where 102 iNTS patients were identified, the majority of whom were HIV-infected adults (71%) and had a high mortality rate (28%). S. Enteritidis (48%) and S. Typhimurium (26%) were the most commonly identified serovars, with S. Typhimurium more common in HIV-infected individuals (p = 0.003). Isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than HIV-negative patients (p = 0.037). These findings suggest that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam with a high mortality rate and a significant burden in HIV-infected adult men. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of iNTS infections in Asia.
Phages, viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria, play crucial roles in their hosts' survival and pathogenicity through lysogenic conversion factors and nutrient redistribution through cell lysis. Analyses of phage- and viral-encoded genes in environmental samples provide valuable insights into the physiological impact of viruses on microbial communities and human health. However, a significant challenge is that over 70% of phage ORFs are dissimilar to any genes with annotated functions in GenBank. To address this, researchers have developed a method of predicting phage structural protein sequences using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANNs, which classify viral structural proteins using amino acid frequency and estimates of protein isoelectric points, have been shown to accurately predict phage structural proteins, even when no significant similarities to known sequences are present. This technology has the potential to significantly improve the identification of viruses and prophages, aiding in disease detection, vaccine development, and understanding the physiological potential of any environment. The remarkable biodiversity of viruses, the limited utility of similarity-based annotation methods, and the importance of discovering the functions of unknown viral sequences for understanding their lifestyle and effects in the environment all highlight the potential value of this technology.
KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus 8, is a gammaherpesvirus that belongs to the Herpesviridae family and is the cause of various malignancies including Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. The virus has a large dsDNA genome with more than 85 open reading frames (ORFs) and can undergo lytic replication or establish latency in infected cells. The ORF20 of KSHV is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 gene family and is conserved in Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae. ORF20 is a poorly characterized gene and encodes 3 colinear isoforms: ORF20FL, ORF20A, and ORF20B. These isoforms have different start codons, with ORF20FL and ORF20B starting with a methionine and ORF20A starting with a noncanonical leucine via a CTG start codon. ORF20 is involved in affecting the mitotic cdc2/cyclinB complex, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.Recent research has found that ORF20 interacts with oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL), an ISG with targeted antiviral specificity. OASL is an ISG that is activated upon pattern recognition receptor and type I interferon (IFN) receptor signaling and has evolved as a host defense mechanism against viral infections. It is a member of the oligoadenylate synthetase protein family that includes the prominent enzymes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), as well as OAS2 and OAS3. The OAS enzymes and cGAS are activated by cytosolic double-stranded nucleic acids and produce 2’-5’-linked second messenger molecules. OASL shares a highly conserved N-terminal OAS-like domain with the OAS enzymes but lacks enzymatic activity and has a unique C-terminus composed of two ubiquitin-like domains (UBL). Additionally, OASL has a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding groove and the OAS-like domain binds dsRNA. OASL has been shown to inhibit IRF7 translation by binding to the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of IRF7 and mOASL1 knockout mice are more resistant to HSV-1 and EMCV infection, likely due to increased interferon production.A study found that ORF20 mRNA is expressed late upon de novo infection of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells and is also detected upon reactivation of a latently infected body cavity-based lymphoma cell line (BCBL-1). The study also found that OASL enhances infection of KSHV, suggesting that KSHV has commandeered this ISG to benefit KSHV infection. ORF20 has been shown to localize to the nucleoli of transfected cells and ORF20 mRNA is expressed early upon reactivation of latently infected HuARLT2-rKSHV . 219 cells. The study analyzed the OASL interactome by q-AP-MS and found that OASL and ORF20 share numerous ribosomal interaction partners, and both proteins copurify with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. Furthermore, when expressed together, they associate with polysomes but do not have a global effect on translation. ORF20 upregulates OASL mRNA expression downstream of RIG-I in an IRF3-dependent manner but independently of IFNAR signaling. These findings suggest that ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection.
This study focused on determining the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children in Nigeria, where there is a high prevalence of endemic viral infections and little information about LVD in children. A prospective study was conducted on febrile children admitted to the Children’s Emergency Room of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital over one year. The children were divided into two groups: those with convulsions (Cases) and those without convulsions (Controls). The overall prevalence of LVD was low (3.5%) and not significantly associated with convulsions in children with fever. The study highlights the importance of considering LVD in children with fever in endemic areas and emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion in diagnosis, especially as it can mimic other common febrile illnesses. The authors suggest that screening of febrile children with undifferentiated fever could be an important medical and public health control measure. The study's limitations include a low number of LVD cases, a lack of data on long-term outcomes, and limited generalizability to other settings. Nonetheless, this study contributes to the literature on LVD in children and highlights the need for further research and awareness of this disease in endemic areas.
Drought is a significant problem for crop production worldwide, so a research project aimed to identify new chemical and genetic factors that regulate drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana was conducted. The study found that mutations in KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), which is thought to be the receptor for karrikins (KARs), a class of butenolide compounds found in smoke that enhance seed germination and promote seedling vigor under stressful conditions, result in hypersensitivity to water deprivation. Further analysis revealed that kai2 mutants have increased rates of water loss and drought-induced cell membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, higher cuticular permeability, reduced anthocyanin biosynthesis during drought, and are hyposensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening assays. These data suggest that there is crosstalk between ABA- and KAI2-dependent signaling pathways in regulating plant responses to drought. The study also found that strigolactones (SLs), another phytohormone, contribute to plant drought adaptation, but not by affecting cuticle development. The findings suggest that chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI2 and D14 signaling may provide novel ways to improve drought resistance. Improving water use efficiency and developing drought-resistant crops are critical innovations for agriculture, especially as water resources become increasingly challenged by climate change and the demands of a growing human population.
Schistosomiasis is a significant public health problem affecting 200 million people in developing countries. Despite the availability of the drug praziquantel, schistosomiasis continues to spread and infect new areas, highlighting the need for a vaccine. Insulin signaling is an important process in the growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production of schistosomes. Researchers have focused on the insulin receptors (SjIRs) of Schistosoma japonicum and have shown that human insulin can bind to the L1 subdomain of recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knock down the expression of the SjIRs in adult S. japonicum, which significantly impacted the transcription of other downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. A decrease in glucose uptake was also observed in the SjIR-knockdown worms. Vaccine/challenge experiments with rSjLD1 and rSjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These findings suggest that the SjIRs have the potential as veterinary transmission blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines. Additionally, insulin receptors play an important role in worm fecundity, and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling and glucose metabolism are essential for schistosome biology. Two types of insulin receptors (SmIR1 and SmIR2 in S. mansoni, and SjIR1 and SjIR2 in S. japonicum) have been isolated, and it is not clear whether schistosomes utilize the insulin receptor to regulate glucose transport via the insulin signaling pathway. However, it is clear that the insulin receptors have significant potential as vaccine targets for schistosomiasis.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major global health issue, with over 120 million infected individuals and an estimated one billion people at risk. The current LF elimination campaign relies on the absence of a non-human reservoir for Wuchereria bancrofti and is enabled by advances in diagnostic tools, treatment, and microfilaricidal drugs. The campaign focuses on interrupting LF transmission through Mass Drug Administration (MDA), which involves treating the entire at-risk population with microfilaricidal compounds to suppress microfilariae levels below the threshold for sustained transmission. However, the efficacy of MDA is compromised in some regions due to mosquito vector biology. In the South Pacific, where over 96% of the 1.7 million population is at risk of LF infection, the diurnal subperiodic form of W. bancrofti is transmitted by Aedes polynesiensis. This mosquito is a more efficient vector in low-level microfilaraemics, making LF elimination challenging.To address this challenge, a study introduced an A. polynesiensis strain (CP strain) that is stably infected with Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility, and laboratory assays have shown that CP males are equally competitive, leading to population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations. This finding suggests that releasing CP males could suppress A. polynesiensis populations and help eliminate LF in the South Pacific. The approach is species-specific, non-transgenic, and uses Wolbachia-based CI, making it a logical segue toward transgenic approaches that may yield improved efficacy and/or cost. However, releasing only males is crucial to prevent establishment of the new infection type and ensure strategy success. Mechanical sex separation tools for mosquitoes have been developed but are not sufficiently accurate. In the event that visual inspection is not cost-effective for large-scale releases, genetic sexing or treating release individuals with low levels of radiation to render unintentionally released females impotent could be used.While the proposed strategy is primarily focused on breaking the LF transmission cycle, transgenic approaches may offer improved efficacy and/or cost. Integrating transgenic releases with Wolbachia-induced CI can increase social palatability by reducing the probability of establishing the transgene in the field. However, the competency of CP to transmit LF, dengue, and other pathogens should be assessed prior to implementing population replacement programs. Overall, the study demonstrates a feasible and encouraging approach to supplement MDA efforts for LF elimination in the South Pacific.
Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne disease that is always fatal if left untreated. In Tanzania, it is heavily concentrated in certain areas and poses a significant socio-economic and public health burden on affected communities. A study was conducted to estimate the public health burden of rhodesiense HAT in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and financial costs in a highly endemic area of Tanzania using hospital records. The study found that the DALY estimate for HAT in Urambo District, with and without age-weighting, were 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3--287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI: 209.1--362.6) respectively. When under-reporting was included, the results were 622.5 (95% CI: 155.3--1098.9) and 978.9 (95% CI: 201.1--1870.8) respectively. The costs of treating 143 patients were estimated to be US$ 15,514, with patients paying US$ 3,673 and the health services paying US$ 11,841. The burden in terms of indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients was estimated at US$ 9,781. This study highlights the significant burden that HAT imposes on affected rural communities in Tanzania and the urgent need for location-specific burden estimates to address the high burden of infectious diseases in the country. HAT is just one of many neglected tropical diseases that disproportionately affect poor rural communities in developing countries. These diseases often occur in clusters and alongside other conditions, including major killer diseases, and have a significant impact on rural livelihoods by contributing to the increasing level of poverty in these communities.
The study analyzes Ngly1-deficient mice and finds that they are embryonic lethal in a C57BL/6 background, but this lethality can be partially rescued by the additional deletion of the Engase gene or by changing the genetic background to a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background. Viable Ngly1-deficient mice in a mixed background show a severe phenotype, similar to that of NGLY1-deficiency subjects, and these defects are suppressed by the additional deletion of Engase. These observations suggest that Ngly1- or Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice could serve as a valuable animal model for studying NGLY1-deficiency and that ENGase represents a potential therapeutic target for this genetic disorder. Ngly1 is a highly conserved deglycosylating enzyme involved in the ERAD process, where it cleaves N-glycans from misfolded glycoproteins. N-glycans released by Ngly1 are processed by cytoplasmic glycosidases such as ENGase and Man2C1. While cytoplasmic ENGase plays a significant role in degrading proteins in the ERAD process, its direct action towards a model substrate was shown to result in the formation of aggregation-prone N-GlcNAc proteins, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating NGLY1-deficiency.
The precise control of positional information during embryonic development is crucial for the correct formation of body plans in organisms. This is achieved through spatial gradients of transcriptional regulators, such as the Bicoid (Bcd) protein in early fruit fly (Drosophila) segmentation. While gene regulation is subject to intrinsic noise, this variability must be constrained in order to ensure reproducible and coordinated developmental events. In the case of the hunchback (hb) gene in Drosophila segmentation, hb mRNA and protein output noise was found to be predominantly dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than on Bcd fluctuations. A stochastic model of the hb promoter was used to fit model parameters to data from wild-type (WT) embryos, the self-regulatory mutant hb14F, and lacZ reporter constructs. This model was robust to the variation in Bcd binding site number across a number of fly species, and indicated that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter play a role in buffering noise. These findings contribute to the general understanding of the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development.
After the hybridization between humans and Neanderthals, Neanderthal alleles were generally removed from the human population due to selection. The genome-wide strength of selection and the density of selected sites were estimated using Neanderthal allele frequency in modern-day humans. It was found that East Asians had higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. The majority of the alleles that were selected against were weakly deleterious in Neanderthals but became selected against in humans due to a larger effective population size. These weakly deleterious alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. Differences in effective population size may play a more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. Genome-wide evidence suggests that modern humans interbred with Neanderthals, resulting in 1.5-2.1% of the autosomal genome of non-African modern human populations deriving from Neanderthals. This admixture is estimated to date to 47,000-65,000 years ago, with potentially a second pulse into the ancestors of populations now present in East Asia. While some introgressed archaic alleles appear to have been adaptive in anatomically modern human populations, on average selection has been suggested to act against Neanderthal DNA from modern humans. This can be seen from the non-uniform distribution of Neanderthal alleles along the human genome. In particular, regions of high gene density or low recombination rate have low Neanderthal ancestry, which is consistent with selection removing Neanderthal ancestry more efficiently from these regions. In addition, the X chromosome has lower levels of Neanderthal ancestry and Neanderthal ancestry is absent from the Y chromosome and mitochondria. The recent sequencing of ancient genomic DNA has greatly expanded our knowledge of the relationship to our closest evolutionary cousins, the Neanderthals.
"The HIV promoter in the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) regulates various aspects of the viral life cycle, including viral gene expression and replication, and the establishment of a latent state. After viral integration into the host genome, stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression amplified by the Tat positive feedback loop can result in a transactivated or inactive state. In a significant fraction of cells harboring an integrated copy of the HIV-1 model provirus, this bimodal gene expression profile is dynamic, with cells continuously switching between active (Bright) and inactive (Off) expression modes. These switching dynamics may contribute to the establishment and maintenance of proviral latency, as long delays in gene expression can occur before viral transactivation. The HIV-1 promoter contains cis-acting Sp1 and NF-κB elements that regulate gene expression through the recruitment of both activating and repressing complexes. Interplay in the recruitment of these factors can modulate the stability of the Bright and Off modes and alter the sensitivity of viral gene expression to stochastic fluctuations in the Tat feedback loop. Mutations in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements result in functional differences in viral gene regulation, with Sp1 sites dampening transcriptional noise and modulating the frequency and maintenance of this model of viral latency. These findings may have biomedical implications for the treatment of HIV latency. HIV-1 can establish rare, latent infections in cells, and the resulting viral reservoirs represent the most significant barrier to elimination of virus from a patient, persisting for decades and potentially reactivating at any time. After HIV enters a cell, it integrates its genetic material into the host genome and utilizes host cell transcriptional machinery to regulate its gene expression. Initial expression from the HIV LTR is hindered by stalling of RNA polymerase II, resulting in a high frequency of abortive transcripts. However, basal transcription generates a small fraction of fully elongated transcripts that yield viral mRNA encoding a positive regulator, the transcriptional activator Tat. Tat binds to cyclin T1, a unit of the endogenous positive transcriptional elongation factor B, and the Tat:P-TEFb complex binds to an RNA motif in stalled HIV transcripts known as the transactivation response element (TAR), enhancing the processivity of RNAPII and enabling the efficient generation of fully elongated transcripts. This creates a strong positive feedback loop of Tat-mediated transactivation, amplifying viral transcriptional elongation nearly 100-fold. Stochastic delays in the onset of HIV-1 Tat expression can contribute to the formation of latent viral infections, and transcription factor binding sites at the HIV-1 LTR can influence the basal viral gene expression, the maximal inducible rate of viral expression, and the dynamics of switching between these two states. Activating complexes may recruit histone acetyltransferases and contribute to stabilizing the transcriptionally active state of HIV, while numerous repressing complexes can recruit histone deacetylases that stabilize the transcriptionally inactive mode. For example, the NF-κB p50-p50 homodimer complex binds to the κB binding sites and can recruit the repressive HDAC1 and HDAC3 factors, while the activating NF-κB p50-RelA heterodimer can recruit the HAT p300, which is required for full Tat activity. The p50-RelA heterodimer can also interact with P-TEFb and aid RNAPII processivity. Similarly, Sp1 can interact with both HDACs and HATs, and thus may mediate both repressing and activating transcriptional mechanisms. Modulation of HIV gene expression with cytokines and other pharmacological agents that function via NF-κB or Sp1-dependent mechanisms further demonstrates the importance of these sites to promoter regulation. Importantly, the deletion or mutation of any of the Sp1 or κB elements compromises the rates of gene expression and/or viral replication, though the effects of mutations or deletions on the establishment of latency have not been explored. Therefore, understanding the interplay between multiple transcription factor binding sites, gene expression noise, and the choice between transcriptional activation and viral replication vs. genetic silencing and latency may have significant implications for the treatment of HIV latency. In summary, the HIV promoter within the viral LTR plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle, including dynamics of viral gene expression and replication and the establishment of a latent state. Mutations in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements can differentially contribute to the regulation of viral gene expression, with Sp1 sites functionally ""dampening"" transcriptional noise and modulating the frequency and maintenance of this model of viral latency. Understanding the interplay between multiple transcription factor binding sites and stochastic gene expression in the context of HIV gene expression regulation may have important implications for the treatment of HIV latency."
The accurate identification of orthologs in genomes is crucial for various applications, such as protein annotation and phylogenetic analysis. However, there are many publicly available orthology databases, and their performance varies. This study compares eleven projects and methods for both phylogenetic and functional definitions of orthology. The results show that OMA and Homologene performed best in phylogenetic tests, while the same two projects, along with OrthoMCL and Inparanoid, performed well in functional tests with varying levels of specificity and coverage. EggNOG provided the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories. The study also found that the tree reconciliation method, although powerful in theory, was not necessarily the best method in practice. The simple BBH approach performed well, likely due to the good comparative accuracy and close functional relatedness of the predicted orthologs. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the definition of orthology, the grouping strategy, and the performance of methods compared to basic methods such as BBH or RSD in upcoming orthology assignment projects.
Schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma, affects over 200 million people worldwide, particularly in lower and middle-income countries of the tropics and sub-tropics. The current treatment for schistosomiasis relies on a single 40-year-old drug, praziquantel, which is effective against all forms of human schistosomiasis but has a low efficacy against the juvenile stage of schistosomes and a limitation in the efficacy of mass drug administration programs due to reinfection rates. Moreover, the World Health Organization recommends PZQ for mass drug administration, which could lead to resistance and therapeutic failure. Therefore, the discovery of novel antischistosomal drugs is of paramount importance.A new computational approach has been developed to identify potential new targets and approved drugs for schistosomiasis. This approach combines remote homology detection techniques integrated with detailed knowledge of the original drug-target interactions to identify potential new targets within a selected genome and potential drugs to interact with those targets. The methodology has been applied to schistosomiasis to identify potential new targets and approved drugs and verify the efficacy of these inhibitors against all three human infective life stages of Schistosoma species. The study elucidated the S. japonicum kinome completing the kinomes of all three major infective Schistosoma species of humans. The kinome analysis, in combination with the repurposing pipeline, allowed the identification of 22 novel schistosome potential targets, such as CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, MEK1, ABL, and suggest approved drugs that could inhibit them. These include previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib as well as newly identified drugs such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, dinaciclib. Additionally, the primary and secondary targets of these approved drugs in Schistosoma are also suggested, which are important for maintaining the parasite’s lifecycle. The pipeline is summarised in Fig 1, and the results provide a valuable resource for the development of novel therapeutics against this important yet neglected disease.
"This summary discusses the interactions between the pKID domain of CREB and the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP, specifically focusing on their folding and binding. Simulations of a Gō-type model predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism, with the existence of partially bound intermediates. The binding transition state is found to be similar to the unstructured state in solution, indicating that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. This is similar to an induced-fit mechanism, contrasting with models where binding occurs to pre-structured conformations. Interestingly, increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a ""fly-casting""-like process. Non-native interactions result in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding. These findings help explain how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition, and are in agreement with recent NMR studies, aiding in the interpretation of experimental binding kinetics."
A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) was conducted, with 132 studies between 1942 and 2014 meeting the inclusion criteria, providing 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points. The studies were mainly from Brazil (69.7%), with the majority conducted in rural communities and community-based. Heterogeneity in the diagnostic tests used and sample methodology was found. The highest prevalence was observed in Brazil, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, and Venezuela. Only Brazil had epidemiological studies conducted after 2001, with high-prevalence states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Pernambuco). The intensity of infection was recorded in 199 data points, with Brazil having the highest number of records (76.9%). The review suggests that the epidemiological status of historically schistosomiasis-endemic countries and territories in LAC needs to be updated, and additional studies are needed to design required SCH control and elimination strategies. Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia need to update the epidemiological status of schistosomiasis to re-design their national programs and target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. Improved reporting and standardization of the monitoring and evaluation methodologies used are recommended. Meeting a regional elimination goal will require additional and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex.
A study examining HIV-1 transmission in six heterosexual epidemiologically-linked subtype C transmission pairs found that consensus-like genomes sensitive to donor antibodies were selected for during transmission. However, the transmitted/founder (TF) variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or viral replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC). The study suggests that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive immune responses reduces viral transmission potential. The TF variant's resistance to the antiviral effects of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) was not significantly different from that of non-transmitted variants from the same transmission pair. The findings support the hypothesis that a selection for consensus-like amino acid and nucleotide sites across the viral genome during transmission occurs. Additionally, TF variants were more efficiently neutralized compared to the medians of the transmitting partner’s NT variants and correlated with distance to the amino acid subtype C consensus. Transmission did not select for TF variants with greater neutralizing antibody resistance to donor plasma, and HIV-1 transmission is permissive to TF variants with a wide range of in vitro replicative capacities relative to the transmitting partner’s quasispecies. Overall, the study provides further insight into the viral requirements of HIV-1 transmission, potentially leading to new targets for intervention.
Filarial infections can lead to lymphatic dysfunction and diseases like lymphedema and elephantiasis, particularly in humans with an intact adaptive immune response. However, even in the absence of an adaptive immune system in murine models, lymphatic dilatation and dysfunction occur due to direct interactions between filarial parasites or their antigens and human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induce LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Serum from infected patients induces increased LEC proliferation, and this differentiation is associated with significantly increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their TIMP inhibitors. Filarial parasites alter the expression of genes involved in cellular organization, development, and adherence pathways, leading to decreased trans-endothelial transport. Filariasis-induced pathology is partly due to immune-mediated mechanisms, but worm-derived factors play a significant role in modulating lymphatic integrity and function. Filarial antigens specifically induce LEC proliferation, and plasma from filaria-infected individuals promotes LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. In vitro studies show that microfilarial antigens and live microfilariae induce LEC differentiation and tube-like structures, while adult parasites do so less completely. These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis, which could contribute to the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis.
Genomic sequencing directly from single environmental bacteria cells is of great interest due to the small fraction of bacteria that can be cultured in a laboratory. A method for obtaining sufficient DNA for sequencing from a single cell is Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA), which eliminates the need to develop culture methods. A study used a microfluidic device to isolate individual Escherichia coli and amplify genomic DNA by MDA in 60-nl reactions. The results showed that reduced MDA reaction volume lowers nonspecific synthesis and amplification bias, providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from both microliter and nanoliter volumes provided high-quality sequence data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells. This technology allows for the recovery of whole genome sequences from single cells, which greatly facilitates the study of microbial ecology and evolution, as the majority of microorganisms cannot be obtained in pure culture. The use of a microfluidic chip allows for the parallel isolation and addressing of multiple single bacteria into separate chambers, performing flexible sample selection, and avoiding contamination that can be introduced by conventional FACS. This technique allows for significant improvement of the amplification specificity by strongly reducing the background amplification without requiring stringent reagent or sample handling protocols.
Hantaviruses, belonging to the genus Orthohantavirus, are known to cause lethal diseases in humans and are primarily hosted by Sigmodontinae rodents in the tropical forests, savannas, and wetlands of South America. The transmission and distribution of these viruses are influenced by factors affecting host populations, with landscape structure playing a significant role. A study in the Atlantic Forest of South America used 283 rodent capture records and geographically weighted models to investigate the relationship between hantavirus host proportions and landscape structure. The study found that hantavirus host proportions were more positively influenced by landscape diversity than by a particular habitat or agricultural matrix type. Local small mammal diversity positively influenced known pathogenic hantavirus host proportions, indicating that habitat plasticity may be more important for these hosts than competition with native forest dwelling species. The study also found that non-defaunated areas can be hotspots for hantavirus disease outbreaks, with sugarcane and tree plantations correlating with higher proportions of rodent hosts. These findings suggest that disease surveillance must be reinforced in the southern and southeastern regions of the biome where the highest predicted hantavirus host proportion and levels of vulnerability spatially match. The study highlights the complex rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease, providing important insights for developing effective hantavirus surveillance and control strategies.
BCL2 family proteins, including pro-survival proteins like BCLXL, BH3-only proteins, and BAX/BAK proteins, control mitochondria-mediated apoptosis to maintain cell homeostasis by eliminating damaged and infected cells. This study investigated the role of BCL2 proteins during apoptosis in cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). The results showed that cell survival upon flavivirus infection depended on BCLXL due to the suppression of MCL1 expression, another pro-survival protein. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors and deficient BCLXL gene expression induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in infected cells. Flavivirus infection reduced cellular protein synthesis, including short-half-life proteins like MCL1. BCLXL inhibition increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. Haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene and administration of BH3 mimetic compounds increased survival rate and suppressed inflammation during JEV infection. Therefore, BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and may provide a novel antiviral target. Flaviviruses, belonging to the Flaviviridae family, are internalized into dendritic cells and keratinocytes, activating and inducing visceral and central nervous system diseases. Infection with flaviviruses induces apoptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, including RIPK3-mediated cell death and IL-1β production and pyroptosis in DENV and HCV infections. BCL2 family proteins, specifically BH3-only proteins, regulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Small molecule inhibitors have been developed for cancer therapy, targeting BCL2, BCLXL, and BCLW, with therapeutic uses for 17p-deleted chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
The global economic impact of canine rabies has been estimated to be significant, with Asia bearing a disproportionate burden due to high levels of human deaths and rates of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but low investment in preventative dog vaccination. A study focused on Vietnam estimated the economic burden of canine rabies over a ten-year period (2005-2014) using data from personal interviews, published literature, reports, and primary data collection. The study incorporated direct and indirect costs of rabies in dogs, livestock, and humans, including PEP-related costs, dog vaccination efforts, livestock losses, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Over the ten-year study period, the total economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam was over $719 million, with 92% of impacts attributed to PEP-related costs. Canine rabies created between 36,560 and 45,700 DALYs, measured in years of life lost (YLL). A total of 914 human deaths were reported over the study period. Deaths/100,000 people were 0.11, which is lower than the reported level for Asian countries. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD. The results indicate that canine rabies impacts in Vietnam are consistent with the burden elsewhere reported in Asia, with large expenditures on PEP and very small investments in dog vaccination. Canine rabies is an economically unique zoonosis, as most of its associated costs do not result from illness in the infected individual but rather are the consequences of human deaths and efforts to prevent the disease in humans, livestock, and companion animals.
The Type II Secretion System (T2SS) is a molecular machine in bacteria that secretes fully-folded protein substrates across the outer membrane, aided by the secretin pore formed by an integral multimeric outer membrane protein. Three distinct forms of T2SSs can be identified based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. Detailed comparative analysis of two of these, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, reveals differences in their pilotins, which mediate transport and assembly into the outer membrane. AspS, a novel pilotin from Vibrio cholerae, is functionally equivalent but structurally unrelated to other bacterial pilotins, demonstrating convergent evolution. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in Vibrio-type secretins, enhancing the kinetics of secretin assembly. Homologs of AspS are found in all Vibrio species and some strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS. Bacterial outer membranes incorporate proteins of at least three well-characterized architectures: β-barrel proteins, lipoproteins, and secretins. Lipoproteins are inserted into the outer membrane by the receptor LolB after being ferried across the periplasm by factors of the Lol machinery, while secretins are integral proteins that assemble to form multimeric secretion channels in the outer membrane. In the case of the T2SS, the secretin multimer in the outer membrane docks onto a platform of inner membrane proteins that energize its function in the selection and/or secretion of substrate proteins across the outer membrane into the external milieu.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., typically transmitted to humans through water contaminated by infected animals. The bacteria can persist in freshwater or soil and enter the host through skin abrasions or mucous membranes, causing symptoms such as jaundice, renal failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The disease has a significant impact on public health and agriculture worldwide.In this study, the functional roles of transmembrane outer membrane proteins OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47 in Leptospira infection were investigated. The results showed that OmpL37 binds specifically to host tissue components, including human skin and aorta elastin, fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, and plasma fibronectin. The binding of OmpL37 to skin elastin is specifically enhanced by rabbit antiserum for OmpL37, suggesting the involvement of OmpL37 in leptospiral binding to elastin and the possibility that host-generated antibodies may promote rather than inhibit the adherence of leptospires to elastin-rich tissues. OmpL37 is also recognized by acute and convalescent leptospirosis patient sera and by Leptospira-infected hamster sera, and its protein is detected in pathogenic Leptospira serovars but not in saprophytic Leptospira.These findings suggest that OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may be promoting attachment of Leptospira to host tissues. The elucidation of novel mediators of host-pathogen interaction, such as OmpL37, is important for the discovery of virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis and the development of diagnostic and protective antigens for the disease.
A few broadly neutralizing antibodies have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals that recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp4
A longitudinal study was conducted in three hyperendemic onchocerciasis foci in Mali and Senegal, where annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment had been given for 15 to 17 years, to assess residual levels of infection and transmission after stopping treatment. The study found that in two of the sites, the prevalence of microfilaria and vector infectivity rate were zero 3 to 4 years after the last treatment. In the third site, where infection levels were comparatively high before stopping treatment, there was also a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. All infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination. The study has established the proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa, and the results have been instrumental in the current evolution from onchocerciasis control to elimination in Africa. Onchocerciasis control in Africa is currently nearly exclusively based on large-scale treatment with ivermectin, and the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) and the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) have been established to support the establishment of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTi) in all areas where onchocerciasis is a public health problem. These programs have been successful in ensuring sustained high treatment coverage and by the year 2010, some 75 million people at risk were treated annually with ivermectin in the APOC countries. The study was conducted in three onchocerciasis endemic foci along the River Bakoye in Mali, the River Gambia in Senegal, and the River Faleme on the border of the two countries. Skin snip surveys, transmission monitoring, and entomological evaluations were conducted in these areas. The results showed a declining trend in infection and transmission levels after the last treatment. In two sites, the prevalence of microfilaria and vector infectivity rate were zero 3 to 4 years after the last treatment. In the third site, there was also a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. The study has established the proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa.
The common cold is caused by human rhinovirus (HRV), a non-enveloped virus of the picornavirus family, which includes poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. During HRV cell entry, the small myristoylated capsid protein VP4 is released and interacts with the cell membrane, delivering the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. A study produced recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged human rhinovirus VP4 and showed that it can induce membrane permeability in liposome model membranes by forming a multimeric membrane pore, allowing for the transfer of the single-stranded RNA genome. The membrane permeability induced by VP4 was comparable to permeability induced by infectious virions. This finding provides a model system for exploring VP4 as a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family. Understanding the mechanisms used by non-enveloped viruses like HRV to deliver their genomes into cells is crucial for the development of new antiviral measures, as there is currently no vaccine or licensed drug to prevent or reduce HRV infection.
Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium and a select agent designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. F. tularensis subspecies novicida (Fn) lipid A has a similar structure to human clinical isolates of F. tularensis, and three enzymes responsible for its carbohydrate modifications were identified. Mutants lacking galactosamine (flmF2) or galactosamine/mannose (flmK) addition to their lipid A were attenuated in mice. These mutants provided protection against challenge with wild-type (WT) Fn when administered either pulmonary or subcutaneously. Infection with the flmK mutant induced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, MIP-2, and IL-6, which are mediated by the MyD88 signaling pathway. MyD88−/− mice, which lack a critical adaptor protein in the TLR signaling pathway, were susceptible to flmK mutant infection. The findings suggest that the ability of the flmK mutant to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and innate immune responses mediated by the MyD88 signaling pathway may be responsible for its attenuation and the induction of protective immunity.
Ribosome assembly cofactors, including the ribosome-associated GTPases (RA-GTPase) widely conserved across all domains of life, coordinate ribosome assembly. In Staphylococcus aureus, the RA-GTPase Era, though non-essential, is crucial for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly and rRNA processing, particularly at suboptimal temperatures. Era interacts with the 16S rRNA endonuclease YbeY and DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA. Both Era and CshA are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing, and they interact with the (p) ppGpp synthetase RelSau, impacting their respective activities. In its GTP-bound form, Era acts as a hub protein on the ribosome, directing enzymes involved in rRNA processing/degradation and ribosome subunit assembly to their site of action. The stringent response of S. aureus impedes this activity, causing a slowed growth phenotype during this stress response pathway.
In this study, the role of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) in the pathogenesis of Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) was investigated. The research found that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) deficiency in mice caused increased sensitivity to LT, while deficiencies in the other two NOS enzymes (iNOS and eNOS) had no effect on LT-mediated mortality. This increased sensitivity of nNOS−/− mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin or cytokine responses. Histopathological analyses showed that LT induced architectural changes in heart morphology of nNOS−/− mice, with rapid appearance of novel inter-fiber spaces but no associated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. LT-treated WT mice had no histopathology observed at the light microscopy level. Electron microscopic analyses of LT-treated mice, however, revealed striking pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS−/− and WT mice, varying only in severity and timing. Endothelial/capillary necrosis and degeneration, inter-myocyte edema, myofilament and mitochondrial degeneration, and altered sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae were observed in both LT-treated WT and nNOS−/− mice. Furthermore, multiple biomarkers of cardiac injury (myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein) were elevated in LT-treated mice very rapidly and reached concentrations rarely reported in mice. Cardiac protective nitrite therapy and allopurinol therapy did not have beneficial effects in LT-treated mice. Surprisingly, the potent nitric oxide scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, showed some protective effect against LT. Echocardiography on LT-treated mice indicated an average reduction in ejection fraction following LT treatment in both nNOS−/− and WT mice, indicative of decreased contractile function in the heart. The heart was identified as an early target of LT in mice and nNOS was discussed to have a protective role against LT-mediated cardiac damage.
Parasitic nematodes infect over 1 billion people worldwide, causing significant disease burden. However, understanding of their biology has been limited by the lack of genetic intervention tools, particularly the ability to generate targeted gene disruptions and mutant phenotypes. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been used in various organisms for targeted mutagenesis, but not in parasitic nematodes due to challenges such as low tolerance for exogenous DNA or protein, labor-intensive and low-efficiency delivery methods, and inaccessibility of host-dwelling life stages. The human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis is a powerful model for studying parasitic nematode biology, with a free-living generation that can be used for transgenesis techniques adapted from Caenorhabditis elegans. Researchers have now developed a method for introducing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruptions in S. stercoralis, resulting in nematodes with motility defects. This breakthrough enables future studies of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites, which may lead to the development of novel targeted therapies for human-parasitic nematode control.
The phenomenon of ribosome drop-off, or premature translational abandonment, is a crucial factor in translational accuracy and nutrient starvation responses during protein translation. It can significantly affect protein expression efficiency under stress conditions such as amino acid starvation or tRNA depletion. A mathematical model is presented that describes the effects of ribosome drop-off on ribosome density along the mRNA and the concomitant protein synthesis rate. The model shows that ribosome premature termination can lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, such as a ribosome density that increases from the 5’ to the 3’ end. The effects of ribosome drop-off on the translation rate are mRNA-specific, and the model predicts that mRNAs which present ribosome queues are much less affected by ribosome drop-off than those which do not. Among those mRNAs that do not present ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with the elongation rate, so that sequences using fast codons are expected to be less affected by ribosome drop-off. This is consistent with genome-wide analysis of S. cerevisiae, which reveals that under favorable growth conditions, mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off. In physiological conditions, the translation rate of mRNAs coding for regulatory, stress-related proteins is less resilient to ribosome drop-off. This model allows for the analysis of variations in the translational efficiency of individual mRNAs by accounting for the full range of known ribosome behaviors and explains mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.
The World Health Organization's (WHO) current strategy for addressing soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children focuses on morbidity control through routine deworming of school and pre-school aged children. However, due to continued transmission occurring in persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment, this strategy may need to be continued for extended periods. There is discussion about accelerating the interruption of transmission using alternative mass drug administration (MDA) strategies. A study called DeWorm3 is currently underway to test the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission. The study follows three years of high treatment coverage with two years of surveillance. A stochastic, individual-based simulation model is employed to evaluate if criteria to determine whether transmission interruption is unlikely can be defined at earlier timepoints. The model simulates core aspects of the DeWorm3 community-based cluster-randomized trial, comparing a control arm (annual treatment of children alone with MDA) with an intervention arm (community-wide biannual treatment with MDA). Simulations were run for each scenario for both Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm. The analyses suggest that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. However, models suggest a tight range of homogenous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters which do not allow for discrimination between bounce back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA. STH remain prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America, and if interruption of transmission can be achieved, cost savings will be observed in countries that can phase out STH MDA programs. The possibility of broadening treatment coverage to include adults for STH is being investigated, with the goal of interrupting STH transmission beyond 2020 using MDA alone.
A study in mice was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a conjugate cholera vaccine (OSP:TThc) made from Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc). The study found that mice immunized with OSP:TThc with or without adjuvant developed significant IgG antibody responses targeting OSP and LPS following a single immunization, while mice receiving un-conjugated OSP with or without immunoadjuvant did not develop such responses. Additionally, administration of OSP:TThc and adjuvant induced memory B cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model. The study suggests that a cholera conjugate vaccine could assist in inducing long-term protective immunity, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.Cholera is a severe dehydrating diarrheal illness caused by organisms Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139 serogroup organisms, affecting 3-5 million people each year and killing approximately 100,000 annually. The current global cholera pandemic is caused by organisms Vibrio cholerae O1, El Tor, with the prevalent serotype fluctuating between Ogawa and Inaba. Protection against cholera is serogroup specific and serogroup specificity is largely determined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of V. cholerae.The study used V. cholerae O1 El Tor Ogawa strain X25049 and wild-type classical V. cholerae O1 classical Ogawa strain O395 for vaccine preparation and immunological assays. LPS was recovered from X25049 and OSP-core was derived from LPS. As a carrier protein, recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc) was used. OSP-core was conjugated to TThc using 3, 4-dimethoxy-3-cyclobutene-1, 2-dione as a crosslinker. Conjugation efficiency was 32% and the antigen/TThc ratio was 6.4∶1. A corresponding conjugate was made of OSP: bovine serum albumin (BSA) for use in immunologic assays.The study used dmLT, a double mutant derivative of Escherichia coli heat labile toxin, as an immunoadjuvant. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with OSP:TThc or OSP with or without dmLT. Mice immunized with OSP:TThc with adjuvant developed the highest anti-OSP IgG responses, while mice receiving OSP:TThc alone or with immunoadjuvant developed low-level vibriocidal responses. No significant IgA anti-OSP or anti-LPS antibody responses developed in any group.The memory B-cell assays after the third round of immunization showed that mice immunized with conjugate vaccine and adjuvant had a significant increase in anti-OSP IgG specific memory B cells, compared to mice immunized with adjuvant alone (95% survival at 36 hours; 95% protection; P<0.0001).In conclusion, the study demonstrated that a cholera conjugate vaccine containing OSP recovered from V. cholerae is protectively immunogenic and induces anti-OSP memory B cell responses in mice. The study suggests that anti-OSP responses may be a prime mediator of protective immunity against cholera. Protective immunity to cholera is serogroup specific, and previous infection with V. cholerae O1 provides no protection against O139 and vice versa. Currently, two oral killed cholera vaccines are WHO-prequalified and commercially available. Following two doses, these vaccines are 40-85% effective for 6-60 months. However, the level of response and duration of protection is particularly decreased in children younger than 5 years of age. The study suggests that a cholera conjugate vaccine could assist in inducing long-term protective immunity, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.
Bacterial-fungal interactions have significant physiologic and medical implications, particularly in the gut which hosts trillions of microorganisms. A study using a neutropenic mouse model found that the fungus Candida albicans inhibits the virulence of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa by suppressing its pyochelin and pyoverdine gene expression, which are critical for iron acquisition and virulence. Heat-killed C. albicans had no effect, while C. albicans secreted proteins directly inhibited P. aeruginosa pyoverdine and pyochelin expression and its virulence in mice. This fungal inhibition of bacterial effectors is a novel observation, demonstrating that fungi can modulate bacterial virulence in the intestine. This finding validates the use of mammalian model systems to explore the complexities of polymicrobial, polykingdom infections to identify new therapeutic targets for preventing microbial disease.
The EM virus, which is a mutated form of the WT virus, can evade CD8+ T cell recognition in HIV-1 or SIV infection. However, the EM virus is often less replication-fit than the WT virus. Reversion to WT virus upon transmission to a naïve host and lower viral load in vivo in HIV-1 infection has been observed. The rate and timing of reversion are variable, with faster reversion seen in inocula with higher proportions of WT virus. A study of SIV and SHIV viruses in pigtail macaques found that inocula with ≥10% WT virus resulted in immediate and rapid outgrowth of WT virus within 7 days, while inocula with smaller proportions of WT sequence had a delayed or slow pattern of reversion. This delayed pattern was associated with significantly lower viral loads. The diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion, which in turn predicts the outcome of infection. The fitness costs of escape mutations contribute to partial viral control even when the epitope is not recognized. The rate of reversion from EM to WT in vivo is highly variable and is impacted by factors such as the particular CD8 T cell epitope, target cell availability, prior vaccination, the presence of compensatory mutations, the MHC of the donor and recipient, and timing of appearance of the mutation. The high mutation rate of HIV and strong immune selection pressure exerted by CD8+ T lymphocytes leads to the frequent selection of EM virus, but these mutations also incur a fitness cost. Reversion from EM to WT virus in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected macaques following transmission to naïve hosts that lack the appropriate MHC alleles to recognize the epitope concerned has been observed.
A study of yeast strains from Evolution Canyon (EC) in Israel found that some strains have an extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium, primarily due to an enhanced function of the metal efflux pump PCA1. Mutations in the promoter sequence, rather than the coding region, are responsible for this enhancement. These mutations are conserved and functionally important in other yeast species, representing an ancestral type that has diverged in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. This selective sweep in yeast populations was driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance. Adaptation to novel or adverse environments can be complicated for organisms as mutations beneficial for survival in one environment may impose a cost under other conditions. Understanding how cells adapt to these environments can provide insights into pathway or functional network flexibility. Experimental evolution and molecular approaches have been used to discover and characterize adaptive mutations in microorganisms, including those related to metal resistance. In this study, a weak PCA1 allele spread to most S. cerevisiae populations, suggesting a tradeoff between metal resistance and fitness under conditions where cadmium is low or absent.
Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, and is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in the deregulation of various oncogenic pathways. A study identified three major oncogenic pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin) that were deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric cancers. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed significant survival differences, suggesting that pathway interactions play an important role in influencing disease behavior. Individual GCs can be taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway activity by expression signatures allows the study of multiple cancer-related pathways interacting simultaneously in primary cancers, at a scale not currently achievable by other platforms. This research highlights the potential of using oncogenic pathway activation as a genomic taxonomy for GC, and the importance of considering pathway interactions in understanding and treating the disease.
Stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) is a process that affects the behavior of each base pair in DNA, and the sites susceptible to SIDD cannot be identified by local sequence attributes alone. Negative DNA superhelicity can destabilize specific genomic regions, and changes in the level of superhelicity can strongly affect regulatory events. SIDD analysis has been used to predict sites that are susceptible to strand separation under negative superhelical stress in the Escherichia coli K12 genome. It was found that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions that are either known or inferred to contain promoters, but rarely occur in coding regions. Further analysis has shown that genes grouped in different functional categories have characteristic SIDD properties in their upstream flanks. Specifically, strong SIDD sites are statistically significantly overrepresented in the upstream regions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, particularly in those that directly respond to physiological and environmental stimuli. The presence of these SIDD sites in the upstream regions of genes functioning in transcription suggests that they are involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes. This association of SIDD sites with upstream regions of genes functioning in transcription is observed in 38 of 43 genomes of free-living bacteria, but in only four of 18 genomes of endosymbionts or obligate parasitic bacteria. These results suggest that SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in superhelically mediated regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in prokaryotes in response to physiological or environmental changes.
High-mobility group (HMG) B proteins are eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins that play a crucial role in global genomic functions and the control of genes involved in specific developmental or metabolic pathways. These proteins are characterized by the HMG-box functional motif and are widely found in various organisms, including the filamentous ascomycete Podospora anserina, which contains 12 HMG-box genes. Of these, four have been previously characterized as mating-type genes that control fertilization and development of the fruit-body, while another encodes a factor involved in mitochondrial DNA stability. Systematic deletion analysis of the eight remaining uncharacterized HMG-box genes in P. anserina revealed that none were essential for viability, but that seven were involved in the sexual cycle. Two HMG-box genes, PaHMG5 and PaHMG9, have striking features: PaHMG5 is a pivotal activator of mating-type genes, while PaHMG9 is a repressor of hyphal anastomoses and other stationary phase phenomena. Transcriptional analyses indicate that PaHMG5 is at the hub of a network of several HMG-box factors that regulate mating-type genes and mating-type target genes, as well as fertility genes that are not regulated by mating-type transcription factors. HMG-box genes are conserved across different species, including fungi and mammals, and play a critical role in sexual reproduction. This conserved function is illustrated by the mating-type genes and their upstream regulatory factor forming a module of HMG-box genes analogous to the SRY/SOX9 module in mammals. Overall, HMG-box genes are crucial transcriptional regulators involved in diverse cellular processes, including sex determination, transcription, genomic stability, and the three R's (replication, recombination, and DNA repair).
The 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic was unprecedented, with over 10,000 survivors documented. Prior to this epidemic, limited data was available on the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors’ body fluids and its potential risks for transmission. In response, an observational cohort study was rapidly implemented in Sierra Leone to investigate the presence of EBOV in semen and other body fluids of EVD survivors. The study was conducted in two phases, with the first phase initiated within five months of initial protocol discussions and assessed persistence of EBOV RNA in semen of 100 adult men. The second phase assessed the persistence of virus in multiple body fluids of 120 men and 120 women. This study informed national and global guidelines in real time and demonstrated the need to implement semen testing programs among EVD survivors. Strong community engagement and international partnerships were crucial in the study’s implementation. The study’s findings highlighted the need for adequate resources to be rapidly made available to answer critical research questions during a public health emergency. This study not only provided critical data on EBOV persistence in body fluids, but also serves as a model for future research during public health emergencies caused by poorly characterized diseases.
The bacterial chemotaxis sensory system has evolved to respond to specific stimuli properties and reliably transmit this information through biochemical pathways. An experimentally well-characterized sensory system should provide valuable information about the statistics of the stimuli. Based on in vivo FRET experiments of the bacterial chemotaxis sensory system, the study predicts the chemical gradients chemotactic E. coli cells typically encounter in their natural environment. To predict average gradients, the study reevaluates Weber's law, Weber-Fechner law, and fold-change detection (FCD) and obtains full distributions of gradients using information theory and simulations, considering limitations of information transmission from both cell-external and internal noise. The results show exponentially distributed gradients, leading to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. The study provides a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine. Bacteria live in complex chemical microenvironments shaped by nutrient supply and depletion. Commensal bacteria in our intestines have vital roles in breaking down undigested food and increasing resistance against colonization by pathogens. However, the chemical gradients microorganisms in the gut typically encounter are not well understood. The study exploits accumulated knowledge about the sensory systems of microorganisms, which have evolved to detect typical stimuli relevant to the organism, to predict typical stimuli such as concentration gradients. Information theory, quantitative dose-response curves from in vivo FRET measurements, and measurements and simulations of swimming bacteria are used to demonstrate predicting distributions of typical gradients of chemoattractant aspartate E. coli likely encounters in its physiological microenvironment. The study maximizes mutual information, implying maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient (chemotactic index) and hence the drift velocity of cells swimming up the gradient. The approach is a first step towards the prediction of typical chemical environments of bacteria, shaped by cellular communities and dynamic turnover of nutrients, which are difficult to determine experimentally but are biomedically highly important for gut metabolism, tissue homeostasis, and disease development in the gastrointestinal tract.
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are vital for a lifetime supply of blood cells, and their long-term function is dependent on their self-renewal capacity. However, recent studies suggest that the lifespan of HSCs is predetermined and HSC-intrinsic, challenging the initial belief that HSCs are immortal. This raises the question of what controls the lifespan of HSCs within the same animal, exposed to the same environment. A new model based on reliability theory suggests that the lifespan of HSCs is determined by preprogrammed differences in repair capacity. This model, which was tested through clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling, found that the repopulation failure kinetics of each HSC are largely anti-persistent or mean-reverting processes. Failure rates increase during population-wide division events and are counteracted and decreased by repair processes. However, a slow increase in the mean failure rate of self-renewal leads to rapid clonal extinction, suggesting that the repair capacity of HSCs is self-limiting. The lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics. Shorter and longer-lived HSCs differ significantly in their pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations. These findings suggest that the lifespan of HSCs is determined by preprogrammed differences in repair capacity. Adult tissue stem cells, such as HSCs, are distinguished from mature cells by their ability to generate all mature cell-types of a particular tissue (multi-potency). To generate mature cells, HSCs differentiate into cells of lower potency. The reliability with which HSCs can transfer their identity and maintain self-renewal upon proliferation has been of keen interest to the field. However, the questions of whether daughter HSCs are ""as good as old"" after self-renewal, how often individual HSCs can self-renew, and what controls the fidelity of self-renewal remain incompletely understood. Despite their extensive self-renewal capacity, HSCs were initially thought to be immortal. However, when HSCs were examined on the clonal level, extensive heterogeneity in lifespan was revealed. A detailed analysis of a large panel of HSCs showed that the lifespan of individual HSCs is mathematically predictable from few initial values of their repopulation kinetic. HSCs with lifespans from 10 to nearly 60 months were found side-by-side in the same donor, indicating that the lifespan is pre-determined on the level of each HSC. The population dynamics of HSCs predict that the molecular machinery which preserves self-renewal will ultimately fail. Hypotheses have been developed to identify and explain how HSCs limit their lifespan. The generation-age hypothesis states that for every cell division, an HSC loses some quality that is referred to as ""stemness."" Hayflick's hypothesis predicts that the probability that somatic cells produce viable daughter cells which can themselves divide decreases as the number of divisions increases. Telomere shortening, which can be caused by progressive telomere shortening, has been suggested to explain a limited lifespan of HSCs. However, HSCs and other stem cells express telomerase, an enzyme that repairs telomere damage and preserves genomic integrity. Mice that have been homozygously ablated for telomerase activity show only mild effects, and declining telomerase expression has been suggested to act in conjunction with the high stressor load imposed by co-morbidities affecting transplant patients. Oxidative stress has been proposed to be a damaging force acting on the long-term repopulating capacity of HSCs. The corresponding restoring force is provided by Forkhead box class O (FoxO) transcription factors. Different sources of self-renewal failures could be causally co-dependent. Alongside genome stability, the preservation of epigenetic patterning is an important prerequisite for reliably producing functional daughter HSCs upon self-renewal. It has been suggested that both maintenance and de novo methylation is needed to maintain epigenetic stability. Expression levels of DNA methyltransferases responsible for maintenance (DNMT1) and de novo methylation (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) could be important for restoring HSC multi-potency. Quantitative work has suggested that small failures may accumulate over time in the DNMT1 pathways leading to the loss of maintenance methylation and, ultimately, epigenetic stability. However, these mechanisms and hypotheses do not explain how HSCs with different lifespans co-exist in a single host. It has been suggested that HSCs preserve their functional integrity over long periods of time by alternating between two states, called resting or quiescent, and active. This idea poses that intermittent transitions to quiescence provide the time needed to minimize the detrimental effects of repeated DNA replication and other stresses on the HSC population as a whole. Mathematically, the lifespan of populations has been addressed in manufacturing, engineering, actuarial and biological applications of reliability theory. Reliability theory was first developed as a quality control tool to predict the time-to-failure, the manufacturing term for lifespan, of manufactured goods to determine warranty times. However, when examined"
A study on intestinal helminths, which infect around one-third of the world's population, revealed that antibodies and alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) play a crucial role in protective immunity against these parasites. Antibodies trap tissue-migrating helminth larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following challenge infection, while AAMs express wound-healing associated genes, including Arginase-1, which impairs larval motility. The antibody-induced expression of Arginase-1 occurs independently of IL-4Rα signaling, indicating a novel IL-4Rα-independent mechanism of alternative macrophage activation. This antibody-dependent and IL-4Rα-independent mechanism mediates anti-helminth immunity and prevents tissue disruption caused by migrating larvae. Intestinal helminths, particularly nematodes such as Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichuria, or Necator americanus, cause severe pathology and impaired responsiveness to vaccines in humans. Approximately 2 billion people are infected with intestinal nematodes, with the most severe infections often found in school children. Although such infections can be treated by chemotherapy, worm burdens typically reach pretreatment levels within 6 months, and drug-resistant helminths present a pressing problem for livestock and human populations. Therefore, understanding host immunity is imperative for developing effective vaccines against intestinal nematodes.
A new, non-intrusive method has been developed to visualize chromosome dynamics during the earlier steps of homologous recombination (HR) for repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSB), using protein oligomerization instead of operator multiplicity to form visible foci. This method was used to analyze resection in single living cells after HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III. The study revealed transient confinement of the damaged chromatin region during the very early steps of resection and a 10-minute period of commitment to HR in a yku70 mutant, which defines the time when the Ku complex is protecting the DNA ends and preventing HR. This new DNA-labelling and -targeting method will be widely applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization, dynamics and function in normal and pathological contexts. DSBs are a major threat to chromosome integrity and cell survival, and cells meet it by launching repair programs consisting of the enzymatic restoration of the DNA and of appropriate chromatin remodelling and checkpoint activation. HR is initiated by DNA end processing, during which the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 complex (MRX/MRN) and Sae2/CTIP generate short 3′-ssDNA tails that then serve as the substrate for extensive resection by Exo1 exonuclease or Sgs1-Dna2 helicase/endonuclease. The role of chromatin mobility in DSB repair has been investigated almost exclusively in relation to the homology search step that follows resection. Changes in chromatin mobility accompanying resection itself have received little attention. Assessing DSB processing in single cells demands that we can distinguish cells that have incurred a break and are resecting from those that have not. A new DNA-labelling tool has been developed to identify budding yeast cells that undergo resection following a single HO endonuclease cut. This tool is based on the kinetochore-like nucleoprotein complexes that activate mitotic segregation in bacteria, and has enabled identification and analysis of cells undergoing resection following a single HO endonuclease cut, revealing a distinct phase of confinement of chromatin neighboring the DSB early in the resection period.
A study used stochastic agent-based models to estimate the rate of reinoculation and frequency of reinfections of Chagas disease in humans. The models were fitted to epidemiological data from Argentinean rural villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of T. cruzi reach 56% in humans. The best model predicted 0.032 (0.008-0.042) annual reinfections per individual, with 98.4% of them occurring in the chronic phase. The risks of reinfection during the typically long chronic stage of the disease stand around 14% (4%-18%) and 60% (21%-70%) after 5 and 30 years, with most individuals being re-infected 1-3 times overall. These low rates are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission than a highly efficient adaptive immune response.
A study on dengue virus (DENV) infections in school-aged Thai children has shown that pre-existing immune responses to DENV can influence the clinical outcome of subsequent infection. Blood samples were collected from a cohort of children who later experienced a subclinical DENV infection or developed dengue illness. Pre-infection peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with DENV, and the secretion of 30 cytokines was measured. It was found that PBMC from children who later developed symptomatic DENV infection had higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1, and IL-6 was produced by PBMC from all subjects who subsequently developed symptomatic infection. On the other hand, IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα were significantly lower in PBMC from subjects with symptomatic infection. These findings suggest that pre-existing immune responses can influence the clinical outcome of DENV infection, with higher levels of some cytokines being associated with symptomatic infection and higher levels of other cytokines being associated with subclinical infection. Understanding these immunological correlations in the context of natural DENV infection may be useful for evaluating immune responses to dengue vaccines.
"In the Drosophila wing disc, the classical morphogen Hedgehog (Hh) forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. However, a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and Hh concentration thresholds has not been demonstrated. A study provides evidence that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and proposes that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Mathematical modeling predicts that at steady state, only two domains can be defined in response to Hh, suggesting that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a static Hh gradient. Computer simulations suggest that a spatial ""overshoot"" of the Hh gradient occurs, i.e., a transient state in which the Hh profile is expanded compared to the Hh steady-state gradient. Through a temporal examination of Hh target gene expression, the patterns initially expand anteriorly and then refine, providing in vivo evidence for the overshoot. The Hh gene network architecture suggests that this overshoot results from the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor, Patched (Ptc). These results support a model in which Hh gradient dynamics, resulting from Ptc up-regulation, play an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression. Morphogens, such as Hh, control patterning by acting at a distance to regulate gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner, and their gradients are often considered static or with largely ignored transient dynamics. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of morphogen gradient dynamics in supporting differential gene expression. The Hh gradient in the Drosophila wing disc exhibits a transient overshoot, a dynamic behavior likely due to the gene network architecture, resulting from Hh-dependent up-regulation of Ptc. This overshoot is necessary to specify more than two domains of gene expression in the system. The hypotheses that the Hh gradient at steady state is insufficient to generate more than two states, the formation of the gradient exhibits a transient overshoot, and that the overshoot is necessary to specify more than two domains of gene expression in the system are experimentally testable and supported by in vivo experimentation. Overall, the dynamic behavior of morphogen gradients plays a crucial role in patterning and specifying distinct gene expression domains."
A new mouse mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), was discovered in a forward mutagenesis screen using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and a sensitized genetic background to identify enhancers of dopaminergic neurotransmission. The Lwt mutation is a nonsense mutation in the mouse homolog of the C. elegans unc-79 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon. Lwt heterozygotes are mildly hyperactive, have altered responses to ethanol and inhaled anesthetics, and weigh less than wild-type littermates. The lighter weight is due to a larger proportion of body weight as lean mass and a smaller proportion as body fat. Lwt heterozygotes also consume similar amounts of food and water but accumulate less fat than +/+ mice. Additionally, Lwt/+ mice are hypersensitive to the sedative effects of ethanol and have altered acute locomotor activation produced by ethanol. The response to inhaled anesthetics is also altered, with a significant resistance to isoflurane-induced anesthesia. Furthermore, Lwt/+ animals exhibited a higher preference for ethanol and consumed more ethanol, particularly at higher concentrations, in a two-bottle choice paradigm. The Lightweight mutation is not due to a polymorphism in the D2 strain but instead is responsible for the observed phenotypes. These findings suggest a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.
The Anopheles gambiae immune response against Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of human malaria, has been identified as a source of potential anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms to control the malaria transmission cycle. One such mechanism is the Imd pathway, which has potent anti-P. falciparum activity. Silencing the expression of caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, or over-expressing rel2, an Imd pathway-controlled NFkappaB transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae mosquitoes that involves an array of immune effector genes. However, unexplored features of this powerful mechanism that may be essential for the implementation of a malaria control strategy still remain. Using RNA interference to singly or dually silence caspar and other components of the Imd pathway, the genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar have been identified, each of which represents a potential target to achieve over-activation of the pathway. The Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, yet also has reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. Caspar silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response even in the relative absence of resident gut microbiota. The Imd pathway components and regulated effectors TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 have been established as relevant in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense, thereby shedding light on the relevance of laboratory versus natural infection intensity models. These results highlight the physiological considerations that are integral to a thoughtful implementation of Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae as part of an effort to limit the malaria transmission cycle, and they reveal a variety of previously unrecognized nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P. falciparum. Malaria remains one of the world's most devastating infectious diseases, and its successful control will require a multifaceted approach involving a combination of multiple strategies. A multitude of potential methods to prevent mosquito-to-human transmission exist, including several based on manipulating the mosquito's immune response. In fact, such an immune response is responsible for one of the most dramatic reductions in the parasite population during the Plasmodium life-cycle: a log-fold loss in parasite numbers as ookinetes cross the mosquito's midgut cells and develop into oocysts. This drop in parasite number is due, at least in part, to an effective cellular and systemic anti-Plasmodium immune assault. Boosting the mosquito's immune response to a level that would fully eliminate this already vulnerable parasite stage could effectively terminate the malaria transmission cycle. Immune signaling pathways are key regulators of insect immune defenses and are therefore attractive candidates for genetic modification to create a mosquito with an immune response that overwhelms the parasite. Although the Toll and Jak-Stat pathways control immune attacks that limit the development of P. berghei, P. falciparum, and/or P. vivax, the immune deficiency (Imd) signaling pathway has emerged as the most effective pathway in terms of activity against the human malaria parasite.
BMMSCs, or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, have been considered promising in treating fibrotic diseases, including chemical- or physical-induced pulmonary fibrosis. However, a study investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of BMMSCs in an experimental model of lung fibrosis by infecting mice with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The results showed that late infusion of BMMSCs into mice infected with P. brasiliensis did not have any anti-fibrotic effect. Instead, the interaction between BMMSCs and the fungus promoted collagen expression and tissue remodeling. Specifically, histological analysis showed an increase of granulomatous inflammatory areas in BMMSCs-treated mice. Additionally, a significant increase of fibrocytes count, soluble collagen, and collagen-3α1, TGF-β3, MMP-8, and MMP-15 genes expression were observed in those mice. However, when combined therapy BMMSCs/ITC was used, there was a decrease of TIMP-1 and MMP-13 gene expression in infected mice. Furthermore, human fibroblasts stimulated with HLS from infected and BMMSCs-transplanted mice showed a higher expression of collagen I.In summary, the study found that late infusion of BMMSCs into mice infected with P. brasiliensis did not have any anti-fibrotic effect, possibly because their interaction with the fungus promotes collagen expression and tissue remodeling. However, when combined therapy BMMSCs/ITC was used, there was a decrease of TIMP-1 and MMP-13 gene expression in infected mice. These findings suggest that the use of BMMSCs alone may not be effective in treating fibrotic diseases caused by P. brasiliensis and that further research is needed to determine the optimal use of BMMSCs in fibrotic diseases.
A recent study investigating the geographical expansion of Phlebotomine vectors of Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean subregion found that ongoing climate changes have contributed to the expansion. The activity of sand flies in these regions is typically seasonal, and phenological data sets can serve as a baseline for continuing investigations on sand fly population dynamics that may impact future scenarios of leishmaniasis transmission. The study, conducted in 2011-2013, involved a consortium of partners from eight Mediterranean countries and entailed entomological investigations in sites where L. infantum transmission had been recently reported. The investigations resulted in the description of seasonal dynamics of over 56,000 sand flies belonging to L. infantum vector species throughout a wide geographical area, including Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey. The study found variations in the time of sand fly appearance/disappearance and seasonal densities in each site, with a common pattern of nocturnal females' activity and a 3-modal trend for P. tobbi in Cyprus representing a novel finding for a L. infantum vector. The potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion was found to be associated with a regular bell-shaped density curve having a wide peak center encompassing the July-September period, and density waves of adults occurred earlier and were more frequent in southern territories. Overall, the study provides important insights into the seasonal dynamics of L. infantum vectors in the Mediterranean region, which can inform future monitoring and control efforts.
Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease in the Asia-Pacific region, caused by the intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. This bacterium primarily infects endothelial cells but can also replicate in monocytes, altering the expression of over 4,500 genes and inducing apoptosis. Monocytes exposed to O. tsutsugamushi exhibit features of M1 polarization, a process characterized by increased expression of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes, and M1-associated cytokines. These in vitro findings are consistent with genetic changes observed in mononuclear cells from scrub typhus patients. Proper diagnosis of scrub typhus remains challenging due to its nonspecific initial symptoms and the lack of an effective prophylactic vaccine. Further study of the interaction between O. tsutsugamushi and monocytes may provide new diagnostic tools and insights into the pathogenesis of scrub typhus.
Ants, like many animals, use visual memory to navigate through complex environments, but how their small brains achieve this is unclear. The mushroom body neuropils have been identified as a crucial memory circuit in the insect brain, and a spiking neural model of this circuit originally developed for fruit flies has been shown to account for the ability of desert ants to rapidly learn visual routes through natural environments. The model's key computational principles include one-shot learning of sparse codes, enabling the theoretical storage capacity of the ant mushroom body to be estimated at hundreds of independent images. The spatial memory that underlies navigational behavior in insects is a controversial issue, and it is possible that insects use path integration, landmark and/or panoramic visual memories, or a combination of these, for navigation. A potential navigation mechanism for insects is the familiarity algorithm, in which an animal compares its current visual experience to all memories ever stored while following a path integration vector homewards. This algorithm has been shown to replicate many features of ant route following and can produce similar search strategies to ants in visual homing paradigms. A variation of this algorithm could potentially be implemented in the mushroom body circuit of the ant brain. However, it should be noted that parsimony in computational terms does not necessarily map to simplicity with respect to the underlying neural architecture, and little is known about the neural implementation of navigational space in insects. Visual processing in the ant brain has not been extensively studied, but anatomically, ants have typical apposition compound eyes with a large visual field and low visual resolution. Visual signals pass through the optic lobe and then directly or indirectly to several other brain regions, including the mushroom bodies. The mushroom body neuropils have a large number of Kenyon cells, whose dendrites form the calyx and whose axons run in parallel through the pedunculus and then bifurcate to form the α and β lobes. The extent of visual input to the mushroom body is significantly greater in ants and other hymenoptera than for many other insects. There is increasing evidence that the mushroom body may play a role in visual learning and navigation in insects. A neural network model of the ant mushroom body has been shown to be sufficient for learning the association of non-elemental olfactory stimulus patterns to a reinforcement signal, and a similar mechanism could potentially be used for visual learning and route following in ants.
In the ongoing battle between plants and microbial pathogens, plants have developed sophisticated defense mechanisms, while pathogens have evolved equally sophisticated means of avoiding host defense. Plants rely on an innate immune system, lacking an adaptive immune system. The plant innate immune system can detect microbial pathogens directly by recognizing microbe-associated molecular patterns or detect general damage or modification caused by microbial pathogens. Plants have a flexible developmental program that allows them to produce new organs as needed, providing them with the ability to replace damaged organs. A system to study pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis has been developed, where cauline leaves infected with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae abscise as part of the defense mechanism. The abscission response is triggered by effectors, with the threshold model regulating cauline leaf defense. Minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, while severe infections result in cauline leaves being shed. Salicylic acid (SA) likely plays a crucial role in the defense response, as genes necessary for SA-mediated defense are also necessary for the full leaf shedding defense response. This study highlights the significance of shedding diseased organs, enabling plants to eliminate disease sources that may spread to healthy tissue and demonstrates that Arabidopsis uses leaf abscission as a defense mechanism against bacterial infection.
The detection of image motion direction begins in the retina, with starburst amacrine cells (SACs) playing a significant role. SACs generate larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion is from their somata towards their dendritic tips than for motion in the opposite direction. This direction selectivity (DS) persists even in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are not essential. The presence of harmonics in the electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular wave visual stimuli indicates nonlinearity, which is likely due to the activation of voltage-gated channels. Ca2+ changes in SAC dendrites evoked by voltage steps and monitored by two-photon microscopy suggest that the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to the soma, due in part to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamatergic synaptic input. Compartmental modeling supports the conclusion that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination. The retina's ability to detect the direction of image motion is vital for the trajectory prediction of moving objects and providing information about motion relative to the environment.
The number of pathogens required to infect a host, known as the infective dose, varies dramatically among pathogen species and is dependent on the mode of action of the molecules used for infection. Pathogens using locally acting molecules require a lower infective dose compared to those using distantly acting molecules. However, pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators may be more virulent due to a larger number of cells in the inoculums, causing more harm to host cells. These predictions were tested using data on 43 human pathogens, and it was found that pathogens using local action have lower infective doses but are not less virulent than those using distant action. Virulence was negatively correlated with infective dose and higher in pathogens infecting wounded skin, compared with those ingested or inhaled. This study highlights the importance of mechanistic details in explaining variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence.
Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms causing schistosomiasis, a disease affecting around 200 million people, mainly in underprivileged regions. Schistosoma mansoni is the most experimentally tractable schistosome species. Although there is growing interest in microRNAs (miRNAs) in trematodes, little is known about their role in developmental processes. In this study, the authors used a bioinformatics tool called Sylamer to analyze the 3’-UTRs of transcripts differentially expressed between the juvenile and adult stages of S. mansoni. The results showed that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence was the only one significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. A novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, was also identified, and its proximal genomic location to sma-miR-277 suggests that they form a miRNA cluster. Further, the authors found that the expression of sma-miR-277/4989 miRNAs was up-regulated in adults while their predicted targets were characterized by significant down-regulation in paired adult worms but remained largely undisturbed in immature females. The study suggests that sma-miR-277/4989 might play a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during development of juvenile worms and indicate an important role in the sexual development of female schistosomes.
A study conducted over five years in a cave inhabited by horseshoe bats in Yunnan, China, discovered 15 new strains of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). These strains were highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8 regions and showed high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain of the S1 gene, ORF3, and ORF8 region. The strains were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared to those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis showed evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. The direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases. SARS is a severe emerging viral disease with high fatality, exhibiting fever, headache, and severe respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. SARS-CoV, the causative agent, has been previously assigned to group 2b CoV and is now a member of the lineage B of genus Betacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. It shares similar genome organization with other coronaviruses but exhibits a unique genomic structure which includes a number of specific accessory genes, including ORF3a, 3b, ORF6, ORF7a, 7b, ORF8a, 8b, and 9b.
The current method for controlling soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in humans involves mass drug treatments in endemic areas, primarily in children, using benzimidazole and imidothiazole drugs. However, there is a need to monitor drug efficacy due to the development of resistance in livestock roundworms to these drugs. The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) is used to detect the emergence of resistance in human STHs, but recent evidence suggests that density dependent fecundity in hookworms can impact FECRT data. This phenomenon, which shows dynamic properties in response to drug treatment, can lead to an increase in egg output in surviving female worms after treatment, resulting in an underestimation of drug efficacy. This impact can vary within groups of people involved in FECRTs, and the potential for underestimation will depend on the ability of worms within particular hosts to increase their egg output. To improve the measurement of relative drug efficacy, it is important to ensure a consistent degree of underestimation in groups of people involved in separate FECRTs. This can be partly achieved by omitting cases with the heaviest infections from a FECRT, as these cases may have the greatest potential to increase their egg output upon removal of density dependent constraints. The potential impact of worm reproductive biology on the utility of the FECRT as a resistance detection tool highlights the need to develop new drug resistance monitoring methods. These methods should examine direct drug effects on isolated worms with in vitro phenotypic assays or changes in worm genotypes.Sources:[1] Brooker, S., Bethony, J., Albonico, M., Fenwick, A., and Hotez, P.

The development of mammalian lungs is a complex process involving branching morphogenesis, which is regulated by numerous factors including cell surface and extracellular matrix molecules. A study found that heparan sulfate (HS) synthetase Ext1 is critical for lung morphogenesis as epithelial deletion of Ext1 resulted in expanded branching tips and reduced branching number, associated with several mesenchymal developmental defects. The mutant lungs also showed reduced levels of SHH signaling activity and increased FGF signaling activity, suggesting a cell non-autonomous mechanism. The study highlights the epithelial HS as a key player for dictating SHH signaling critical for lung morphogenesis.Lung development is a multi-step and fine-tuned process starting from the emergence of the lung primordium at embryonic day (E) 9.5 in the foregut endoderm. The lung buds undergo morphogenic changes to generate a tree-like structure until E16.5, regulated by interactions of signaling pathways in the epithelium and mesenchyme. The distal signaling center is marked by the expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 10 in the mesenchyme, which serves as a chemoattractive cue for epithelium outgrowth. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) produced in the epithelium is required for mesenchymal development and negatively regulates Fgf10 expression, leading to a focal Fgf10 expression pattern in the intertubular mesenchyme to facilitate the formation of new epithelial buds.HS are linear polysaccharide chains synthesized by the glycosyltransferase exostosin (EXT) 1/2 complex, attached to core proteins to form Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs). HS chains exhibit a wide spectrum of binding affinity to growth factors and are widely involved in mammalian organogenesis. Despite the critical roles of HS in lung development, limited studies have unveiled the role of HS in lung development. Mice deficient in N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (NDST1) had disrupted BMP signaling and displayed a lung atelectasis associated with differentiation defects. Mice lacking Hs6st1 display postnatal changes in lung with no major organogenesis defects. These results indicated a spatial-temporal regulation of lung development by HS sulfation patterns.To further understand the role of HS in mammalian lung development, a conditional model to deplete the HS chains in all HSPGs would provide new insights into the general roles of HS in mammalian lung development. A study used a Shhcre mouse line to conditionally ablate Ext1 gene in the developing mouse lung epithelium and found that epithelial HS is required for lung branching morphogenesis by maintaining SHH signaling activity. Loss of Ext1 resulted in a failure in separation of esophagus and trachea, malformation of cartilage rings, reduced proliferation activity, and reduced phosphorylation of ERK, suggesting a reduced FGF signaling. These findings uncovered a critical regulatory role of epithelial HS in directing epithelial-mesenchymal interaction during lung branching by proper control of SHH-FGF signaling. However, the lack of rescue of branching number by SAG treatment suggested that epithelial inactivation of Ext1 may have pleiotropic effects on other signaling pathways that affect lung branching. The study also suggested that epithelial HS directly or indirectly modulates canonical WNT signaling in developing lung, however, the reduction of canonical WNT signaling may only play a minor role in branching or synergize with other dysregulated signaling pathways to contribute to some aspects of the developmental defects of Ext1 mutant lungs.
Paired-end sequencing is a key technique for assessing genome rearrangements and structural variation on a genome-wide scale, particularly useful for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations which are common in cancer and can produce novel fusion genes. A formula for the probability of a fusion gene's existence in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end sequences from this genome is derived, and used to compute fusion gene probabilities in several breast cancer samples, accurately predicting fusion genes with a relatively small number of fragments of large size. The ability to detect fusion genes depends on the distribution of gene lengths, and different parameters of a sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection, breakpoint localization, and fusion gene detection. These results will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, enabling the discovery of new fusion genes that might provide tumor-specific biomarkers or drug targets, as recurrent translocations and their resulting fusion genes occur in various tumors including solid tumors. Whole genome paired-end sequencing approaches allow for a genome-wide survey of all potential fusion genes and other rearrangements in a tumor, with advantages over transcript or protein profiling in cancer studies. Theoretical and practical considerations for assessing cancer genome organization using paired-end sequencing approaches are addressed, deriving a formula for the probability of fusion between a pair of genomic regions given the set of all mapped clones and the empirical distribution of clone lengths, useful for prioritizing follow-up experiments to validate fusion genes. The probability of detecting fusion genes with the least amount of sequencing is maximized, depending on multiple factors including the number and length of end-sequenced clones, the length of genes that are fused, and possible errors in breakpoint localization. High throughput sequencing strategies enable the detection of an extremely high probability of breakpoint detection with a very low number of reads, and localize the breakpoints of these rearrangements to intervals of less than 300 bp in a single run of the machine.
Chemotaxis, the ability of cells to move towards or away from chemical gradients, is a fundamental process in many biological systems. It is mediated by separable but interrelated processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. A mathematical model was developed to describe these processes in terms of reaction-diffusion equations, which are implemented in separate modules for excitable network, local excitation-global inhibition, and a cytoskeleton-dependent polarity module. The excitable network module accounts for random migration, while the local excitation-global inhibition module biases the direction of excitability in response to combinations of uniform stimuli and gradients. The cytoskeleton-dependent polarity module allows unstimulated cells to move persistently and contributes to distinct sensitivity between the front and back of cells in gradients. The model can recreate most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells and can simulate changes in cellular morphology using a mechanical model of the cell cortex implemented in the level set framework. By varying the strengths of various feedback loops in the model, cellular behaviors similar to those of genetically altered cell lines can be obtained. Overall, this model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex process of chemotaxis.
TDRD6 is a male germ line-specific protein essential for chromatoid body structure, elongated spermatid development, and male fertility. It interacts with the key protein arginine methyl transferase PRMT5, which supports splicing, and associates with spliceosomal core protein SmB in an arginine methylation dependent manner. In Tdrd6-/- diplotene spermatocytes, PRMT5 association with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are much reduced, impairing the assembly of spliceosomes and leading to increased levels of U5 snRNPs and decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies. Transcriptome analysis revealed high numbers of splicing defects such as aberrant usage of intron and exons as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions. This study demonstrates a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes. Spermatogenesis is the process of generating haploid male gametes required for sexual reproduction in higher eukaryotes, and features unique chromosome properties and behavior such as the pairing of homologous chromosomes and formation of the synaptonemal complex in pachytene. Prophase I is the longest phase of meiosis, and TDRD6 is expressed only from mid prophase I spermatocytes onwards and localizes to the chromatoid bodies. It interacts with MVH, MILI and MIWI, and loss of TDRD6 results in mis-localization of ChB components MVH and MIWI. In the absence of TDRD6, the ChB architecture is impaired and spermiogenesis is arrested at the round-to-elongated spermatid stage. TDRD6 functions in distinct RNA pathways during spermatogenesis, and a male germ cell-specific pathway of spliceosome assembly.
The transmission and persistence of bacterial colonies in a host play a significant role in host health, serving as a reservoir that transmits to other hosts and from which invasive strains emerge. Understanding the rates of acquisition and clearance of colonizing populations is crucial in studying colonization dynamics. Research has traditionally used whole genome sequencing to determine genetic distance between isolates to infer the relationship between them. However, this approach has limitations as it may not accurately account for the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, time intervals between consecutive measurements, and uncertainty in the estimated acquisition and clearance rates. To address these limitations, a fully Bayesian model has been developed that provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing for the determination of bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. This method explicitly models within-host variation using population genetic simulation, and the inference is done using a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method was validated with simulations and demonstrated its use in practice by analyzing a collection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a large recently completed longitudinal clinical study. The use of this Bayesian statistical framework allows for rigorous quantification of uncertainty, explicit statement of modeling assumptions, and straightforward utilization of multiple data sources. This method for identifying strains with explicit assessment of uncertainty will enable studies of the characteristics that impact colonization in the presence and absence of interventions.
The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is responsible for generating all aerial parts of plants through the activity of populations of stem cells called meristems. The SAM is a highly organized structure with a central zone for maintaining the meristem and a peripheral zone capable of initiating new organ primordia. The young organs are usually initiated in highly ordered spiraled or whorled patterns, a phenomenon called phyllotaxy, which varies among plant species and growth conditions. Auxin, a key hormone, plays a crucial role in primordium formation and is actively transported throughout the plant from cell to cell by carriers located at the cell plasma membranes. PIN proteins, which facilitate auxin efflux, often accumulate on one particular side of the cell, suggesting that auxin is evacuated preferentially via that side. The coherent behavior of PIN proteins in cell populations is essential for phyllotaxy. A flux-based polarization hypothesis proposes that any small flux between two cells in the system will reinforce itself by increasing the local amount of PIN, thus initiating a positive feedback loop. Computational modelling supports this hypothesis, showing that a flux-based polarization mechanism can explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem and provide a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant. Further experiments are required to distinguish between flux-based polarization and other hypotheses.
The search for diagnostic biomarkers for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has been aided by the increasing number of high-quality sequenced genomes and freely available bioinformatic tools. These tools can be combined with wet lab experiments for a rational search for improved, point-of-care diagnostic tests. Previous research has shown the potential of IgG1 as a biomarker for monitoring clinical status in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), but the use of a crude lysate antigen (CLA) as a capturing antigen can lead to variability in results. By identifying specific antigens to replace the CLA, more robust RDTs can be developed. Immunoblots and mass spectrometry have been used to identify L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients, and in silico algorithms have been used to map linear epitopes and screen for evidence of constitutive protein expression and the presence of antigenic domains. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and nonendemic healthy control patient sera, and showed sensitivity and specificity supporting its use as a diagnostic marker. This approach of combining comparative genomics, in silico algorithms, and wet lab experiments can be applied to the development of more robust IgG1 RDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.
A study of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran found that 18.2% of cases had caseating granulomas, which is usually associated with mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis (TB). This unusual finding can complicate the diagnosis of CL in endemic and non-endemic regions, especially with international travel and immigrants from non-endemic areas. The study found that cases of CL with caseating granulomas had a slower healing process compared to those without, with no association with specific species or age groups. This may be due to worse host immune response or more aggressive Leishmania strains. The study emphasizes the importance of considering CL in the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, and the need for further research to understand the mechanisms that lead to caseating granulomas in CL.
Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease caused by the combination of insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion, and is associated with obesity. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is heritable, and numerous associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and the diabetes risk in humans have been identified. However, the functional consequences of these SNPs at the molecular, cellular, and physiological level are not well understood. Obese mouse strains carrying the Lepob (ob) or the Lepdb (db) mutation have been valuable models for the study of the pathophysiology and genetics of type 2 diabetes. The diabetic phenotype in these strains is conferred by the background strain, and it is assumed that lean mice may carry diabetogenic and/or diabetes-protecting alleles. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for obesity and hyperglycaemia have been separated in outcross experiments of New Zealand Obese (NZO) mice and lean strains, proving the concept that diabetes is the result of a combination of adipogenic and diabetogenic alleles.In this study, the researchers focused on a QTL (Nidd/SJL) on distal chromosome 4 that aggravated and accelerated diabetes in an outcross population of NZO with the lean SJL strain. This QTL exhibited high LOD scores for the trait blood glucose and reproducibly doubled the prevalence of diabetes in a NZOxSJL backcross population. The researchers used interval-specific congenic introgression to identify a critical interval of distal chromosome 4 (2.1 Mbp) that confers the diabetic phenotype. Analysis of the 10 genes in the critical interval revealed a striking allelic variance of Zfp69 encoding zinc finger domain transcription factor 69. A retrotransposon (IAPLTR1a) in intron 3 of Zfp69 was found to disrupt the gene in NZO and C57BL/6J mice, while the diabetogenic SJL, NON, and NZB alleles generated a normal mRNA. The diabetogenic Zfp69SJL allele produced hyperglycaemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides when combined with the B6 . V-Lepob background. mRNA levels of the human orthologue of Zfp69, ZNF642, were significantly increased in adipose tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL, and that retrotransposon IAPLTR1a contributes substantially to the genetic heterogeneity of mouse strains. Expression of the transcription factor in adipose tissue may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
The differentiation of mammalian cells, specifically within the vertebrate hematopoietic system, is controlled by the concerted action of signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks. However, predicting the exact cell differentiation from specific signals and transcriptional factors is still a daunting challenge. This is particularly true for T helper (Th) cells, which have many branching differentiation pathways and cell types. In this study, the researchers proposed an integrated model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation, with a focus on the core control of this process. They used a qualitative, logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses and cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network. Through simulations, they identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, but also found that these coexist with other hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. The logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships to canonical Th subtypes. The model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico. The precise roles of the different molecular species involved in the regulation of T cell differentiation are sparsely known, and the extended logical formalism is a discrete modelling framework well adapted to biological systems where available information is qualitative. This framework allows for the modeling of a regulatory network in terms of a regulatory graph, where nodes represent regulatory components and arcs represent interactions between these components. Logical rules are then defined for each regulatory component to specify its target activity level according to the levels of its regulators. The state transition graph is then used to describe the dynamical behaviour of the system, with attractors corresponding to potential asymptotical behaviours, either stable states or cyclical components. The asynchronous dynamical analysis of increasingly large regulatory graphs can be very challenging due to the exponential growth of the state transition graphs, but this can be addressed by reducing the model by removing intermediate components and preserving a number of dynamical properties of the original model. The logical framework also allows for the analysis of the dynamical roles of the regulatory circuits embedded in a regulatory graph, with positive circuits enabling the existence of alternative differentiated cell lineages. A comprehensive logical model was built by integrating a large set of documented molecular actors and interactions, with the resulting model available in the model repository linked to the GINsim website. Simulations are then performed to determine how naive cells can differentiate into specialized cells, depending on local environments, and how these differentiated cells respond to environmental changes.
The binding of transcription factors (TFs), which regulate gene expression during animal development, occurs at thousands of genomic regions, with quantitative differences in binding mediating their activity. While we can now identify TF-DNA affinities and genome-wide distribution, the forces determining where, when, and to what extent they bind remain unclear. A thermodynamic model of TF binding was used to evaluate the impact of different biophysical forces on the binding of five Drosophila melanogaster TFs involved in early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning. The model, incorporating DNA sequence, protein-DNA affinities, cooperativity, competition, and spatial patterning, dramatically improved in vivo binding predictions when incorporating experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility. This restricted predictions to regions of open chromatin, correlating well with known target genes. The results suggest that combining experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models can accurately predict the binding landscape of animal TFs. In vivo crosslinking studies show that animal TFs bind to many DNA regions throughout the genome, with many strong binding events at functional cis regulatory modules and many thousands of other genomic regions bound at lower levels, not apparent functionally. The mechanisms proposed for these complex, quantitative patterns of factor occupancy include: (1) competitive inhibition of binding at DNA regions that overlap sites occupied by other sequence-specific factors, nucleosomes, and chromatin-associated proteins, and (2) direct and indirect cooperative interactions between factors bound at physically proximal sites that increase their affinity at those sites. However, the extent of each mechanism's influence on the overall pattern of factor binding in vivo remains unclear. Therefore, a model was established to predict the levels of factor occupancy and quantify the contribution of various factor-targeting forces, using gHMMs, allowing efficient integration of forces that influence transcription factor binding. The model, trained on in vitro TF-DNA binding affinities and in vivo binding measurements, provided a quantitative measure of transcription factor binding, overcoming the limitation of Markovian property of gHMMs through a sampling procedure.
In developmental biology, understanding the mechanisms that regulate organ growth is a major concern, as this knowledge can help explain both physiological and pathological processes, such as cancer. The E protein family of basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors and their inhibitors, the Id proteins, regulate cell proliferation in metazoans. The activity of these factors is often deregulated in cancerous cells. In Drosophila, the E protein orthologue Daughterless (Da) and Id orthologue Extramacrochaetae (Emc) control proliferation in epithelial cells during development. Specifically, during the G2/M transition, Emc regulates cell proliferation via Da by controlling the activity of the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. The ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Emc or high levels of Da can rescue the proliferative defects seen in these mutant cells, and Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string. This mechanism defines how Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da, which transcriptionally represses string. Cell proliferation is a critical event in organ formation, and it is regulated by multiple cellular signals. During development, individual cells interpret these signals to determine whether to continue proliferating or to induce cell cycle arrest and initiate differentiation. The basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors are key regulatory molecules that control multiple developmental processes in species from yeast to humans. In metazoans, bHLH proteins orchestrate cell cycle control, cell lineage commitment, and cell differentiation. Dimerization of the HLH domain allows these proteins to form homo- or heterodimers, while their basic domain is responsible for their capacity to bind to DNA. The bHLH proteins are classified into different categories according to their function, distribution, and DNA-binding properties. The E protein family is a group of class I bHLH factors, and they are believed to serve as cell cycle effectors, although this function remains controversial due to the diversity of cell cycle-specific target genes identified for E proteins. The functional redundancy between the members of these two families has also complicated the study of their influence on cell proliferation. In Drosophila, the interaction between Da and Emc, the only representatives of classes I and V, is a determinant of cell fate decisions in different developmental contexts and is necessary to maintain a proliferative state during organ development. The regulatory network between Da and Emc is evolutionarily conserved, and changes in the expression of emc by different extracellular signals modulate the levels of Da. Emc can bind directly to Da, and elimination of Emc promotes an increase in Da homodimers. In vertebrates, Id2 is thought to bind to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB), abolishing its growth-suppressor activity. The role of da in regulating proliferation has not been studied in depth, but both emc and da are required for the G2/M transition in the cell cycle in Drosophila.
A comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline was developed to identify key proteins in specific pathways, discover protein-protein interactions, and infer signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data. The pipeline, customized for phosphoproteome data, includes phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery. It was applied to interventional experiments using SILAC technique with kinase-dead mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identifying 5 high-confidence and 19 hub proteins involved in stress responses and filamentous growth. Four of the predicted proteins presented differential invasive growth, validating the approach. This pipeline provides a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation, applicable to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms. Reversible phosphorylation plays a crucial role in signal transduction and the regulation of cell growth and development. However, few signaling networks have been completely delineated. Quantitative phosphoproteomics is an emerging tool for large-scale determination of relative phosphorylation levels. The pipeline includes phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery to identify key proteins in specific pathways, discover protein-protein interactions, and infer signaling networks. It was applied to interventional experiments using SILAC technique with kinase-dead mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and successfully identified 5 high-confidence and 19 hub proteins involved in stress responses and filamentous growth. Four of the predicted proteins presented differential invasive growth, validating the approach. This pipeline provides a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation, applicable to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms.
The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes has resulted in the development of two types of chromosome-specific regulation: dosage compensation and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). Dosage compensation equalizes X chromosome gene expression between males and females, while MSCI transcriptionally silences the X (or Z) during meiosis in the germline. In Drosophila melanogaster males, X chromosome-wide dosage compensation is absent from most of the germline and there is no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis. However, a premeiotic chromosomal difference in expression is observed where autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters have reduced expression when inserted on the X chromosome. This X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.
"Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen used to model human diarrheal infections caused by Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). These pathogens form intimate epithelium-adherent microcolonies, also known as ""attachment/effacement"" (A/E) lesions, which must be dynamic and able to self-renew by continuous re-infection of the rapidly regenerating epithelium. A study focused on the earliest events in C. rodentium infection found that all colonic epithelial A/E microcolonies are clonal bacterial populations, and their establishment within the first 18 hours of infection shapes the ongoing intestinal geography and severity of infection. Mechanistically, induced resistance to A/E lesion de-novo formation is mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling and is induced specifically by virulent C. rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner. This demonstrates that the establishment phase of C. rodentium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a very short window of opportunity that determines both disease geography and severity. EPEC and EHEC remain important causes of human diarrhea and mortality worldwide."
The researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, which can be used in various fields such as ecology and genomic epidemiology. This method is designed to provide unbiased and accurate estimates of population overlap even when only a fraction of each population is sampled. The method is specifically useful in the study of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, particularly in analyzing the diversity of its var genes. Var genes are important in the parasite's virulence and duration of infection. However, traditional methods of estimating var gene repertoire overlap are prone to bias due to subsampling. The new method uses Bayesian inference to model the stochastic process of sampling and provides a natural framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates. The method can also be used for study planning by quantifying the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty. The new method is demonstrated to provide more accurate estimates of var gene repertoire overlap compared to traditional methods.
Eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) are crucial for various cellular functions through phosphorylating targeted protein substrates using a highly conserved catalytic core. The catalytic core undergoes open, intermediate, and closed conformations in the active state, which is not well understood. However, recent studies using cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as a model with biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques have identified intramolecular interactions that regulate the active state mechanics. These interactions include a salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix, an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and αC-helix, and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues from the Regulatory spine and Shell. Interestingly, the β3-lysine, previously thought to be essential for phosphoryl transfer, is not required for this process but is essential for the active state mechanics. EPKs, discovered in 1943, with functional elucidation in 1956, share a highly conserved catalytic core that mediates the transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to a protein substrate. PKA, discovered in 1968, has been the prototype for understanding EPK structure and function. EPKs are involved in almost all biological processes and have been associated with numerous human diseases, making them key candidates for therapeutic intervention.
American Samoa, a US territory in the South Pacific, has a population of around 55,000 people and has been conducting mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination from 2000 to 2006. In 2016, a study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of school-based Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) and community-based surveys for post-MDA surveillance. The school-based TAS targeted children aged 6-7 years, while the community-based survey targeted individuals aged ≥8 years. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip.The school-based TAS identified nine antigen-positive children, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3--1.8). Of the nine positive children, one was microfilaraemic. The community-based survey identified 102 antigen-positive people, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI: 4.5--8.6). Adjusted village-level prevalence ranged from 0--47.1%. CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. Of 86 antigen-positive community members from whom slides were prepared, 22 (25.6%) were microfilaraemic.The study found that school-based TAS had limited sensitivity (range 0--23.8%) and negative predictive value (range 25--83.3%) but had high specificity (range 83.3--100%) and positive predictive value (range 0--100%) for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community-based survey identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission.In conclusion, while school-based TAS is logistically simpler and enables sampling of a larger proportion of the target population, it may not provide a good indication of the overall CFA prevalence in older age groups and is not sensitive at identifying foci of ongoing transmission. Community-based surveys, although operationally more challenging, provide more detailed information on estimates of community-level CFA prevalence, highlight foci of high prevalence, and identify Ag- and Mf-positive people who are capable of perpetuating transmission. Therefore, a combination of both school-based and community-based surveys is recommended for post-MDA surveillance to confirm the elimination of LF.
The zebrafish is a commonly used model organism, but the process of sex determination in this species is not well understood. Sex determination in domesticated zebrafish is polygenic and can be influenced by environmental factors, as well as the requirement of germ cells for female sex determination. A recent study has found that oocytes are required for the maintenance of the differentiated female state in adult zebrafish. The study reports a novel role for Bmp15 in maintaining adult female sex differentiation in zebrafish. Females deficient in Bmp15 begin development normally but switch sex during the mid- to late- juvenile stage and become fertile males. The function of Bmp15 in female sex maintenance is likely linked to the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis via promoting the development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle. Primary sex determination in wild zebrafish is regulated by a ZZ/ZW genetic system, but in domesticated zebrafish, it relies on a polygenic system that is strain-dependent. Even in wild strains where the W chromosome is necessary for female primary sex determination, a fraction of ZW individuals develop as males. This shows that while a dominant sex-determining chromosome can strongly influence the outcome of sex determination in zebrafish, it is not an absolute prerequisite. In some species of fish, systems other than dominant sex-determining loci can influence or override a genetic sex-determining strategy. Zebrafish are classified as juvenile hermaphrodites as all fish initially produce early-stage oocytes, regardless of their eventual sex. Oocytes are required for primary female sex determination and are also required throughout adult life to maintain the female sex. The study found that oocytes produce a signal that functions to stabilize female-specific gene expression within early somatic gonad cells during the primary sex determination phase of development as well as to maintain the female differentiated state in adults.
Hox genes are crucial for controlling morphogenetic diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals by regulating distinct sets of target genes. Individual Hox proteins control cell diversification and pattern formation in a highly localized manner due to their high-regulatory specificity. This specificity is achieved through cooperation with other transcription factors to activate or repress their target genes in a context-specific manner. A study analyzing the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) found that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. This combinatorial interaction of Hox proteins and other transcriptional regulators on small regulatory elements is responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets. The regulation of rpr by Dfd is highly complex, with Dfd having activating and repressing activity even when acting on a small regulatory element. A total of 16 transcription factors were identified to affect Dfd-dependent rpr expression, with seven of them having a significant effect. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal precision of Hox target gene regulation.
The genetic requirements for defense responses of an autoactive mutant of the Arabidopsis coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein, ADR1-L2, were studied. ADR1-L2 functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in several defense contexts and can act as a “helper” to transduce specific microbial activation signals from “sensor” NB-LRRs. This helper activity does not require an intact P-loop. However, in the context of unregulated runaway cell death (rcd) in an lsd1 mutant, ADR1-L2 function is P-loop dependent. The autoactive missense mutation, ADR1-L2D484V, leads to dwarfed plants with increased disease resistance and constitutively high SA levels. The morphological phenotype and signaling from ADR1-L2D484V are also P-loop dependent, suggesting canonical activation of this NB-LRR protein. The genetic requirements for ADR1-L2D484V activity resemble those that regulate an SA-gradient-dependent signal amplification of defense and cell death signaling initially observed in the absence of LSD1. ADR1-L2D484V autoactivation signaling is controlled by both EDS1 and SA in separable, but linked pathways. Overall, these findings suggest an SA-dependent feedback regulation loop that includes ADR1-L2, providing insight into the complex immune signaling of plants.
In Arabidopsis, MORC6, a member of the Arabidopsis MORC family of proteins, mediates transcriptional silencing through heterochromatin condensation. MORC6 physically interacts with SUVH9, a SU ( VAR ) 3-9 protein involved in recruiting Pol V to methylated chromatin regions. This interaction suggests that MORC6 may be functionally related to the RdDM pathway. While MORC6 does not significantly contribute to DNA methylation at most SUVH2/9 target loci (Class II), it does contribute to DNA methylation at a small subset of SUVH2/9 target loci (Class I). Specifically, MORC6 is responsible for DNA methylation at 527 Class I SUVH2/9 target loci, while being dispensable for DNA methylation at 5987 Class II loci. These findings suggest that MORC6 has a role in DNA methylation at a small subset of RdDM target loci. Additionally, MORC6 forms a complex with its two close homologs, MORC1 and MORC2, and may function redundantly in DNA methylation at Class II hypo-DMRs. A morc1 mutation introduced by the CRISPR/CAS9 system was used to generate a morc1/2/6 triple mutant, but DNA methylation was not reduced at four class II loci even in the morc1/2/6 triple mutant. Overall, the MORC family proteins contribute to DNA methylation only at a small subset of RdDM target loci and the transcription of both transposable elements (TEs) and genes is affected in suvh2/9 and morc6 mutants, with a significant overlap in co-up-regulated TEs.
Hsp90, a molecular stress-response chaperone, can buffer underlying genetic variation and its function is crucial for the robustness of the wild-type phenotype. In zebrafish, mild perturbation of Hsp90 function during critical developmental stages can uncover cryptic genetic variants, leading to variable penetrance and expressivity of developmental anomalies. This is supported by the observation of previously unobserved specific developmental anomalies in zebrafish following partial inhibition of Hsp90 function. These phenotypes were manifestations of underlying cryptic genetic variation and depended on the strain used and the developmental stage at which the Hsp90 inhibitor was administered. Hsp90 inhibition can also modify the severity of some, but not all, already characterized developmental anomalies. Molecular studies show that in the presence of Hsp90 inhibition, one of the mutant proteins studied is rapidly decreased, while its WT allele is largely unaffected, providing a molecular model for Hsp90 modulation of phenotype at the organismal level. Hsp90 protein function is required at all times in eukaryotic cells and is specifically inhibited by compounds like geldanamycin or radicicol, which compete with ATP for the nucleotide-binding pocket, disrupting Hsp90 activity. Hsp90 inhibitors have been proposed for amelioration of protein-aggregation-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Increased binding affinity of Hsp90 inhibitors to mutated protein complexes preferentially sensitizes them to Hsp90 inhibition, allowing differential killing of malignant versus normal cells, which is exploited in cancer treatment.
Protein modification plays a crucial role in various biological processes in living organisms, with amino-terminal acetylation being a common protein modification found throughout the tree of life. This co-translational modification occurs at the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain, often after the removal of the initiating methionine residue. While the enzymes and protein complexes involved in these processes have been extensively studied, the biological function of N-terminal modification events remains largely unknown.To identify common principles of N-terminal acetylation, a study analyzed the amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells. They detected over 1,200 mature protein N-termini and found that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. The researchers identified the ( X ) PX rule as the sole true determinant for N-terminal acetylation, preventing acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer a protein to study the biological relevance of the presence or absence of an acetyl group, providing a generic assay to probe the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation.N-terminal acetylation occurs during protein synthesis, combining two consecutive events: the removal of the N-terminal methionine by methionine aminopeptidases and the acetylation of the amino-terminus by N-terminal acetyl transferases (NATs). In eukaryotes, both processes usually take place co-translationally on the nascent polypeptide chain. The N-terminal region of a protein defines its acetylation status, although sequence specificities of the different NAT complexes do not always correlate with acetylation events, suggesting that additional factors, such as amino acid sequence patterns or the secondary structure of the protein's N-terminus, may play a role.The study identified 124 previously unknown alternative translation initiation sites and/or splice variants, revealing that amino-terminal acetylation is a common event in Drosophila. A protein's acetylation state strongly correlates with the presence of certain functional protein domains, and a proline at position one or two of a nascent protein prevents N-terminal acetylation under all circumstances. The researchers propose that by applying the ( X ) PX rule in similar ways in other species, the function of N-terminal acetylation can now be generically studied.
The ability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) III to efficiently recycle from termination to reinitiation is crucial for abundant tRNA production during cellular proliferation, development, and cancer. Understanding the unique termination mechanisms used by RNAP III and its link to high transcription output is incomplete. A study using S. pombe and two tRNA-mediated suppression systems identified 122 point mutation mutants of Rpc1, the largest subunit of RNAP III, with gain-and loss-of termination phenotypes. These mutants cluster in the active center bridge helix and trigger loop, as well as the pore and funnel, indicating involvement of the RNA cleavage domain of the C11 subunit in termination. An increased elongation rate was demonstrated for a multiple-isolate mutant, supporting a kinetic coupling model in which elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency. The mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including C11, are key determinants of termination, and some of the mutations activate RNAP III for overall transcription. Similar mutations in spontaneous cancer suggest this as an unforeseen mechanism of RNAP III activation in disease. The conserved core structures of multisubunit RNA polymerases in all domains of life synthesize different RNAs, and the RNAP active center has a catalytic site at one end of an 8–9 bp RNA:DNA hybrid binding cavity. The catalytic mechanism relies on two mobile elements, the bridge helix and trigger loop, which position substrate and promote forward movement by a ratchet-like mechanism.
A new method has been developed to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm. This method performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices at predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. The predictions lead to a new hypothesis for the role of SH2 domains in signaling and can be used to derive biologically relevant testable hypotheses. The method can predict whether a protein-phosphopeptide complex will be disrupted or not by dephosphorylation and can be used to predict the energetics of phosphorylated residues. The performance of the structure-based calculations in the prediction of in vitro protein-phosphopeptide binding specificity is similar to experimental methods based on peptide libraries. FoldX can predict in vitro binding of phosphopeptides to SH2 domains with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70±0.03 (p-value 3.1⋅10−11). The performance of FoldX is similar to experimental methods based on peptide libraries in the prediction of SH2-mediated in vivo interactions, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.80±0.02 (p-value 4.5⋅10−25) for the FoldX predictions. The final goal of the work is to make useful predictions of SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions by filtering for sites known to be phosphorylated or predicted to be phosphorylated and within a disordered region. The area under the ROC curve for prediction of SH2 target proteins increases from 0.79±0.02, (p-value 9.2⋅10−26) for the unfiltered FoldX predictions to 0.93±0.02, (p-value 7.9⋅10−53) for the filtered predictions. FoldX improves the performance of the phosphorylation/secondary structure filter, supporting the combined use of both prediction methods.
The abnormal accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into toxic oligomers and amyloid deposits is a primary pathology in tauopathies, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common. Intrinsically disordered proteins like tau are rich in proline residues that regulate their secondary structure and aggregation propensity. The orientation of proline residues is regulated by cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases), among which cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) has been identified as a PPIase that dissolves tau amyloids in vitro. CyP40 interacts with tau at sites rich in proline residues, and its PPIase activity is necessary for its disaggregation activity. CyP40 can also interact with and disaggregate other aggregating proteins that contain prolines. A unique structural property of CyP40 may permit disaggregation to occur in an energy-independent manner. This study highlights the potential of CyP40 as a novel human protein disaggregase and its capacity to dissolve intracellular amyloids, which could be exploited to mitigate disease pathogenesis in neurodegenerative disorders.
Heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria filaments is a prime example of cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms, which is facilitated by a genetic circuit that responds to nitrogen deprivation. A systems biology approach has been employed to understand the principles of heterocyst pattern formation, by formulating the essential dynamical ingredients of the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacterium into a set of differential equations. This approach allows for the study of the behavior of a single cyanobacterium under different external conditions, emulating nitrogen deprivation, and simulating the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments by coupling their respective genetic circuits via molecular diffusion. The study reveals that diffusion and noisy external conditions are crucial for the formation and sustainment of heterocyst patterns in cyanobacteria filaments, recapitulating the main features of heterocyst pattern formation as observed experimentally. The mathematical modeling of differentiation processes and their associated pattern formation demands an integrative approach combining tools from statistical mechanics and the theory of dynamical systems.
The Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program has significantly improved the fight against onchocerciasis, or river blindness, in Africa. However, in Cameroon, after over 15 years of mass treatment, onchocerciasis prevalence remains above the non-transmission threshold in certain regions. This study aimed to examine the potential association between people's beliefs, perceptions of the CDTI program, and their adherence to ivermectin in three Cameroonian health districts. Results showed that adherence to ivermectin was lower in Yabassi (40.7%) compared to Bafang and Bafia (55.0% and 48.8%, respectively). Among factors related to program perceptions and disease representations, perceptions of the program were most determinant in adherence to ivermectin. Misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission, such as the lack of hygiene and the belief that onchocerciasis is caused by high sugar intake, were still prevalent. Perceptions of ivermectin distribution campaigns were more strongly associated with adherence than education/sensitization during the implementation of the CDTI program. To improve adherence, local health authorities should strive to better involve communities and encourage community distributors' work.
This study combined SNP and DNA methylation data with protein biomarker measurements for cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease to investigate the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variation and biomarker levels. The study incorporated data from 121 protein biomarkers, 470,000 genomic positions, and over 10 million SNPs in epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses. Researchers identified 124 and 45 loci associated with biomarkers in EWAS and GWAS, respectively, and found that most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory, while most EWAS loci were located in trans. Additionally, eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers. While some cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers appeared to have an effect on DNA methylation levels, cis-regulatory SNPs for DNA methylation were not observed to affect biomarker levels. Overall, the study's findings suggest that protein biomarker and DNA methylation levels are associated at numerous loci in the genome, likely reflecting underlying patterns of genetic variants or environmental exposures. While epigenetic modifications are associated with disease development, the causality of these associations remains uncertain, and further research is necessary to determine the role of epigenetic alterations in disease pathogenesis and heritability.
Natural Killer (NK) cells are important anti-viral effectors in Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) infection, but how VZV affects NK cell function is unclear. This study found that VZV impairs NK cell responses to target cell stimulation in vitro, affecting both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This was dependent on direct contact between NK cells and VZV-infected inoculum cells. Both VZV-infected and uninfected NK cells exposed to virus in culture were inhibited. The inhibition of NK cell function was due to VZV paralyzing NK cells from responding, as indicated by NK cells still being capable of releasing cytotoxic granules when the stimulation signal bypassed receptor/ligand interactions and early signalling. VZV infection also inhibited NK cell production of IFN-γ and TNF cytokines, while HSV-1, a closely related virus, demonstrated a similar capacity to render NK cells unresponsive to target cell stimulation but differentially targeted cytokine production compared to VZV. These findings reveal a previously unreported strategy for VZV to manipulate the immune response.
Apparent motion (AM) is an illusory motion percept that can be induced when two stimuli are alternately presented at different locations. While some studies suggest that AM activates neurons in early visual cortex (V1) tuned to locations along the AM path, other studies have failed to find such activation. Behavioral studies have reported impaired perception of stimuli along the AM path, suggesting that AM-related activation in V1 interferes with the perception of physical stimuli. However, AM masking can also be explained by predictive coding models, which suggest that responses to stimuli presented on the AM path are suppressed when they match the spatio-temporal prediction of a stimulus moving along the path. In the present study, the authors used computational modeling to investigate the effects of AM on early visual processing. They found that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to cause masking or to be perceived as motion, and that strong suppression of early sensory responses best explains the observed masking effects. These findings support the theoretical framework of predictive coding, which emphasizes the role of predictive signals in reducing prediction error and suppressing sensory signals that can be expected based on the higher-level hypothesis.
The HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax plays a critical role in CD4+ T cell transformation by promoting cell proliferation and survival, mainly through permanent activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of many NF-κB target genes. However, the molecular mechanism by which Tax activates the IKK complex, a key player in the NF-κB pathway, is not well understood due to the blending of primary Tax-induced IKK activation events and secondary IKK activation events induced by cytokines secreted by the primary Tax-induced IKK-NF-κB activation events. To dissect the essential cellular components for primary IKK activation by Tax, a cell-free system was reconstituted and it was found that Tax is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase that, together with UbcH2, UbcH5c, or UbcH7, catalyzes the assembly of free unanchored mixed-linkage polyUb chains. These free mixed-linkage polyUb chains are then responsible for direct IKK activation by binding to the NEMO subunit of IKK. This study reveals the biochemical function of Tax in the process of IKK activation, which utilizes the minimal cellular ubiquitination components for NF-κB activation.
The establishment success of alien species is consistently determined by the number of individuals introduced to found a population, known as propagule pressure. A Bayesian meta-analytical review of a broad range of taxa and life histories, from invertebrates to long-lived trees and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success across all hypotheses tested. However, establishment success most critically depends on propagule pressures in the range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was primarily associated with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Studies conducted at spatial scales where data can be directly measured, such as experimental approaches, produced larger effect sizes compared to global surveys and those that are observational, likely due to data inconsistencies and errors. Proxies for components of propagule pressure, such as the number of individuals released, are often used due to difficulties in directly measuring propagule pressure, but these are expected to produce relatively weaker effect sizes compared to direct measures from observational or experimental studies. Overall, alien populations founded by more individuals are more likely to establish, and this relationship is clearly positive across all subsets of data analyzed. The rate at which establishment probability increases with incremental increases in the size of the founding population is remarkably consistent across experimental studies, and management needs to reduce alien species releases to very low levels to have confidence that establishment is unlikely.
Interleukin-17A (IL-17) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in chronic inflammation and host defense. It is implicated in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8, GM-CSF, and IL-6, by attenuating the decay of encoding mRNAs. The mRNA decay of these mediators depends on proteins (AUBPs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region and facilitate either mRNA decay or stabilization. AUBPs and the target mRNA assemble in a novel ribonucleoprotein complex in the presence of microRNA16 (miR16), leading to the degradation of the target mRNA. IL-17 attenuates miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBPs over that of destabilizing AUBPs, reducing mRNA decay. Since AUBPs affect expression of about 8% of the human transcriptome and miR16 is widely expressed, IL-17 may impact many other cellular processes. Additionally, IL-17 has been shown to synergize with TNF-α in IL-8 protein production by human lung epithelial-like NCI-H292 cells and human primary bronchial epithelial cells, primarily by attenuation of IL-8 mRNA degradation. The AUBPs KHSRP, TTP and AUF-1 have been implicated in IL-8 mRNA degradation, and TTP and KHSRP promote degradation of IL-8 mRNA. In contrast, AUF-1 protects IL-8 mRNA from degradation and enhances IL-8 mRNA expression. Knockdown of AUF-1 reduces IL-8 mRNA expression by 80-90% in cells exposed to TNF-α plus IL-17 or TNF-α alone. IL-17 promotes the contribution of AUF-1 to IL-8 protein expression. IL-17 changes the conformation of the complex between IL-8 mRNA, miR16 and the AUBPs, and both IL-8 mRNA and miR16 co-purify with these immuno-purified preparations, indicating a core complex that binds various AUBPs, miR16 and target mRNAs. Co-incubation with an anti-TTP antibody super-shifted some IL-8 probe, suggestive of a TTP-IL-8 mRNA complex in which TTP was accessible to anti-TTP. Failure to detect miR16 in this super-shifted material may indicate its absence, but may also be due to lack of sensitivity. These findings suggest an intricate interplay between the various AUBPs and miR16 in regulating IL-8 production, which also differs between cells exposed to TNF-α or TNF-α plus IL-17. In cells exposed to TNF-α, in which there is a profound IL-8 mRNA degradation, IL-8 mRNA is bound predominantly by KHSRP, TTP and miR16, which promote IL-8 mRNA degradation. In cells exposed to TNF-α plus IL-17, most IL-8 mRNA is bound to AUF-1 with no miR16 associated, which inhibits IL-8 mRNA degradation. Therefore, IL-17 changes the relative contribution of the AUBPs and miR16.
In Uganda, both chronic and acute forms of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) are prevalent, with acute HAT traditionally restricted to the southeast and chronic HAT to the northwest, although this is changing. Acute HAT has been spreading rapidly to new districts, linked to the movement of infected cattle following restocking. Cattle act as long-term reservoirs of human infective trypanosomes, posing a significant risk to human health. A study was conducted in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts to examine the relationship between human T. b. rhodesiense infection and human infective and non-human T. brucei s. l. circulating in cattle at the village level. The study found that cattle from case villages had significantly higher odds of T. brucei s. l. infection and T. b. rhodesiense than those from non-case villages. Cattle age also had a significant effect on the likelihood of T. brucei s. l. infection. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between infected cattle and infected individuals to respond appropriately to the risk posed by animals infected with human pathogens in a village setting. The continuing northward spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in Uganda raises the prospect of an overlap between Rhodesian and Gambian foci, which would complicate diagnosis and treatment. Surveillance of animal trypanosomiasis has been suspended in Uganda due to budgetary restrictions and decentralization of veterinary services, making it difficult to calculate the true burden and impact of HAT.
The NSL complex, which contains the MOF protein, is a major histone H4 lysine 16-specific acetyltransferase in mammals and Drosophila. In Drosophila, the NSL complex is involved in the regulation of both X-chromosomal and autosomal genes as part of the MSL and NSL complexes, respectively. While the function of the MSL complex in dosage compensation is well understood, the role of the NSL complex in gene regulation is not well characterized. To gain insight into the function of the NSL complex, a comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of four NSL complex members was performed in Drosophila melanogaster. The analysis revealed that the majority of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types and are characterized by an increased abundance of the histone modifications H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac in gene promoter regions. These genes also have a well-defined nucleosome free region and broad transcription initiation patterns. Furthermore, both NSL proteins, NSL1 and NSL3, are required for efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to NSL target gene promoters. The observed Pol II reduction coincides with compromised binding of TBP and TFIIB to target promoters, indicating that the NSL complex is required for optimal recruitment of the pre-initiation complex on target genes. Genes that undergo the most dramatic loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdowns tend to be enriched in DNA Replication–related Element (DRE). These findings show that the MOF-containing NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies by modulating initiation of Pol II transcription.
Researchers have created transgenic mice carrying D4Z4 arrays from an FSHD1 allele and a control allele to study Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), a muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4. The mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients, making them a valuable animal model for FSHD. FSHD is caused by D4Z4 repeat contraction-dependent or -independent chromatin relaxation in somatic tissues, leading to low levels of DUX4 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle. The mice show high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, incomplete epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. DUX4 is able to activate similar functional gene groups in mouse muscle cells as it does in human muscle cells. These transgenic mice are a useful resource to study the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD and to test new therapeutic intervention strategies.
A malaria vaccine candidate, Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1), has shown to induce protection but only against parasite strains closely related to the vaccine. Overcoming this problem requires understanding the structural basis of cross-strain invasion inhibition. A vaccine containing four diverse allelic proteins (AMA1 Quadvax or QV) elicited polyclonal rabbit antibodies that inhibited the invasion of various vaccine and non-vaccine strains of P. falciparum. QV induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies compared to a strain-specific, monovalent, 3D7 AMA1 vaccine. This was associated with increased conserved face and domain-3 responses and reduced domain-2 response. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAb) raised against the QV reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1, which mapped to the conserved face of AMA1 and encompassed the 1e-loop. These mAbs were more potent than previously characterized AMA1-inhibitory mAbs and inhibited AMA1 binding to its ligand RON2. Despite the availability of effective drugs, malaria mortality remains a global health and economic concern, with increasing drug resistance to front-line antimalarials. A vaccine that prevents the disease or reduces the parasite burden is urgently needed. Human anti-malarial antibodies can inhibit invasion, and antigens that induce invasion inhibitory antibodies are primary candidates for vaccine development. AMA1 is a promising vaccine candidate, with anti-AMA1 antibodies inhibiting the invasion of merozoites into red blood cells, and inhibitory activity correlating with protection in non-human primate malaria models. However, inhibitory AMA1 antibodies are highly strain-dependent, and vaccination with a yeast-derived bivalent mixture of 3D7 and FVO alleles did not enhance inhibition against non-vaccine strains. Synthesized as an 83 kDa trans-membrane protein, native AMA1 undergoes maturation to a 66 kDa form, which then translocates to the merozoite surface. During the invasion process, AMA1 undergoes proteolytic shedding to yield 48 and 44 kDa soluble forms. Once on the merozoite surface, the 66 kDa AMA1 form interacts with the parasite RON proteins, which are integrated into the host cell membrane. The understanding of the biological role of AMA1 during invasion has prompted researchers to target the AMA1-RON2 interaction for vaccine development.
The asymmetric division of cells, which involves the unequal distribution of cell fate determinants and cell size, is a crucial process in many organisms. This asymmetry is often achieved through the displacement of the mother cell's mitotic spindle to an asymmetric position within the cell before cytokinesis. While the molecular mechanisms behind spindle displacement have begun to be elucidated, the precise timing of this process is not well understood. A recent study in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote found that the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its degradation target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) comprise a previously unrecognized timer for spindle displacement. The APC and Cdc20/Fizzy delay spindle displacement, while inactivating CDK in prometaphase causes the spindle to displace early. This delay ensures that the spindle does not begin to move until it is fully assembled. This is the first demonstration of a link between the cell cycle and asymmetric cell division in an animal cell. The mitotic spindle is displaced at a similar stage of mitosis during asymmetric cell divisions in diverse systems, suggesting that this link between the cell cycle and asymmetric cell division may be evolutionarily conserved.
High-altitude regions, which lie above 2,500 meters sea level, pose severe challenges to human habitation due to reduced ambient oxygen tension caused by decreased barometric pressure, a condition known as high-altitude hypoxia. The Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau are two high-altitude regions where humans have lived for millennia, leading to unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations. While these physiological responses have been well-studied, the genetic basis underlying these adaptations remains unclear. A genome scan identified genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia in both Andean and Tibetan populations. These populations exhibit largely distinct genetic adaptations, with both showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, the EGLN1 gene, known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans, albeit with different patterns of variation. The results suggest that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, with multiple chromosomal regions implicated in the response to selection. These findings provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.
Inverted DNA repeats (IRs) near a double-strand break (DSB) in DNA can lead to genomic instabilities by channeling repair from accurate pathways to break-induced replication (BIR) pathways. This occurs due to the formation of unusual DNA structures when IRs are present in single-stranded DNA resulting from DSB resection. IRs can form two types of unusual DNA structures, determined by the length of the spacer separating them. IRs separated by a long (1-kb) spacer are predominantly involved in inter-molecular single-strand annealing (SSA) leading to the formation of inverted dimers, while IRs separated by a short (12-bp) spacer participate in intra-molecular SSA, leading to the formation of fold-back (FB) structures. Both of these structures interfere with accurate DSB repair by gene conversion and promote genomic destabilization. Different protein complexes are involved in processing FBs containing short (12-bp) versus long (1-kb) single-stranded DNA loops. Given the high abundance of IRs in the human genome, this research may contribute to the understanding of IR-mediated genomic destabilization associated with human disease.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, with chronic infections thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms. A study was conducted to develop an animal model for studying P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in Drosophila melanogaster. The researchers found that at 24 hours post oral infection, P. aeruginosa biofilms localized to and were visualized in dissected Drosophila crops, with a characteristic aggregate structure and an extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. P. aeruginosa cells recovered from in vivo grown biofilms had increased antibiotic resistance relative to planktonically grown cells. In vivo biofilm formation was dependent on expression of the pel exopolysaccharide genes. The pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilms and was significantly more virulent than PAO1, while a hyperbiofilm strain (PAZHI3) demonstrated significantly less virulence than PAO1. Biofilm formation was associated with induction of antimicrobial peptide gene expression, while infection with the non-biofilm forming strain pelB::lux resulted in decreased AMP gene expression in the fly. This research provides novel insights into host-pathogen interactions during P. aeruginosa oral infection of Drosophila and highlights the use of Drosophila as an infection model that permits the study of P. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo.
The vasopressin receptor 1a gene (Avpr1a) shows significant variation in expression patterns both within and between species, which is responsible for differences in vasopressin-mediated social behaviors. While previous research suggested that both the proximal 5' flanking region and a polymorphic microsatellite element within that region of the vole Avpr1a gene are associated with variation in V1a receptor (V1aR) distribution and behavior, neither has been causally linked. A study using homologous recombination in mice revealed that proximal 5' flanking sequences have a modest contribution to species differences in V1aR distribution and confirmed that variation in V1aR distribution affects stress-coping in the forced swim test. The study also demonstrated that the vole Avpr1a microsatellite structure affects Avpr1a expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring some of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central V1aR patterns in voles. This study provides the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles, offering a mechanism for generating behavioral diversity both at the individual and species level. However, the study suggests that many features of species-specific expression patterns are mediated by elements outside of the immediate 5' flanking region of the gene. Overall, this research highlights the complexity of genomic mechanisms that contribute to phenotypic diversity across species and among individuals within a species, particularly in behavioral traits.
In B cells, transcription of the switch (S) regions of immunoglobulin genes generates R-loops, which are targeted by AID, leading to class switch recombination (CSR) and translocations with c-MYC, contributing to Burkitt's lymphomas. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, R-loops formed co-transcriptionally in THO mutants trigger genome instability and facilitate deamination by human AID. A yeast chromosomal system was developed to analyze chromosomal rearrangements in both wild-type and THO mutants, demonstrating that AID acts in yeast at heterologous S and c-MYC transcribed sequences, leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and translocations via Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). AID-induced translocations were strongly enhanced in yeast THO null mutants, consistent with the idea that AID-mediated DSBs depend on R-loop formation. This study provides new insights into the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability, highlighting the conserved factors and pathways required for AID-mediated DNA lesions leading to DSBs responsible for NHEJ-dependent genome rearrangements and CSR in both yeast and mammalian B cells.
In Escherichia coli, the coordination of cell division and chromosome replication is crucial for producing viable offspring. It was traditionally thought that this coordination is achieved through the precise positioning of the cell division apparatus relative to the nucleoids. However, recent studies have shown that cells lacking proper positioning of their cell division planes can still propagate. These studies have also characterized how these cells partition their chromosomes into daughter cells during asymmetric divisions. Quantitative time-lapse imaging has shown that the DNA translocase, FtsK, can pump as much as 80% (3.7 Mb) of the chromosome from one daughter compartment to another at an average rate of 1700±800 bp/s. The majority of DNA movement occurs at the latest stages of cell division, after the cell division protein ZipA has already dissociated from the septum and the septum has closed to a narrow channel. These findings suggest that the narrow constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK. While much is known about FtsK interactions with DNA at the atomic and molecular scales, there is limited understanding of how FtsK functions in partitioning DNA in the cellular context when it is attached to the divisome. Recent studies have shown that FtsK is involved in the ordered segregation of the replication terminus region of the E. coli chromosome, and appears to be the fastest known DNA processing machine in vitro, with pumping rates ranging from 5 kb/s at 20°C to 16 kb/s at 37°C. However, in vitro assays have shown that periods of fast pumping are interrupted by spontaneous reversals and dissociations from DNA. FtsK is able to displace and sometimes bypass many DNA binding proteins, but its interactions with DNA in the cellular context when it is attached to the divisome are not well understood.
Epitope-based vaccines (EVs) have a wide range of applications, from therapeutic to prophylactic approaches, and from infectious diseases to cancer. The development of an EV is based on the knowledge of target-specific antigens from which immunogenic peptides, called epitopes, are derived. However, due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns, the number of epitopes that can be included in an EV is limited. Additionally, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding these epitopes is highly polymorphic, making the optimal selection of these epitopes an important and interesting optimization problem. A mathematical framework based on integer linear programming (ILP) has been presented to address this problem, which allows the formulation of various flavors of the vaccine design problem and the efficient identification of optimal sets of epitopes. This ILP approach outperforms other strategies and has been shown to be flexible and effective in selecting a set of epitopes that is most likely to elicit a broad and potent immune response while considering common immunological requirements. The use of EVs has numerous advantages, including safety, ease of production, analytical control, and distribution, and is applicable in personalized vaccination. Recent studies have shown the success of EVs in preclinical and clinical trials for various cancers and infectious diseases. The design of an EV entails the critical step of epitope selection, which is usually made on a case-by-case basis, considering key properties such as overall immunogenicity, mutation tolerance, population coverage, antigen coverage, and antigen processing. Various methods, both experimental and computational, have been used to determine the relevant attributes of each candidate, but the final choice of the set of epitopes is typically performed manually. In this work, an integer linear programming approach is proposed to find a provably optimal set of epitopes for an EV, considering various quality criteria such as population coverage, antigen coverage, and overall immunogenicity. This approach outperforms other methods and is flexible enough to account for personalized vaccines.
HIV-1, the virus responsible for AIDS, is predominantly transmitted from men to women through vaginal intercourse via virus-containing semen deposited on the cervico-vaginal mucosa. Semen contains various biological factors, including cytokines, that can impact HIV-1 transmission. One such cytokine is IL-7, which is elevated in the seminal plasma of HIV-1-infected individuals. In an ex vivo study using human cervico-vaginal tissue, IL-7 was found to enhance HIV-1 replication, promote the proliferation of CD4+ T cells, and prevent apoptosis of these cells. This pro-viral role of IL-7 was observed with various HIV-1 strains and primary isolates, irrespective of viral inoculum dilution or the addition of seminal fluid. These findings suggest that high levels of seminal IL-7 during early-stage HIV-1 infection may contribute to the survival and local expansion of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa, thereby promoting the dissemination of the virus.
RNA interference (RNAi) plays a crucial role in controlling arbovirus infections in mosquitoes, with two RNAi pathways involved: the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) and exogenous short interfering RNA (exo-siRNA) pathways. The exo-siRNA pathway is considered the primary mosquito antiviral response mechanism. In Aedes aegypti-derived cells, Zika virus (ZIKV) induces the production of ZIKV-specific siRNAs, which are loaded into the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2). However, the knockdown of Ago2 does not enhance virus replication, while a Dcr2-knockout cell line shows enhanced ZIKV replication, indicating the exo-siRNA pathway's antiviral role. The piRNA pathway, although suggested to be antiviral, has only been shown to involve Piwi4, which does not bind piRNAs. Instead, Piwi4 is involved in the control of alphavirus, bunyavirus, and ZIKV replication. The ZIKV capsid (C) protein amplifies the replication of an alphavirus-based reporter system, but it does not display exo-siRNA pathway inhibition like the yellow fever virus (YFV) C protein. These findings contribute to understanding the specific arbovirus-vector interaction, which may support efforts to understand the rapid spread of this virus.
Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis with a worldwide distribution, but it is highly endemic in Latin America. Historically, sporotrichosis has been attributed to a single species, Sporothrix schenckii, but recent taxonomic analyses have led to the identification of four new species in the Sporothrix complex. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, sporotrichosis is largely occurring via transmission from infected cats to humans, and the main purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association between manifestations of sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro and the different genomic species of S. schenckii sensu lato. A cross-sectional study was performed in 50 patients with different clinical forms of sporotrichosis, and their isolates were studied by phenotypic and genotypic methods. The findings suggest that Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and that S. brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole. S. brasiliensis was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection without underlying disease, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection, whereas patients with S. schenckii presented with less severe and more often localized disease. Additionally, S. brasiliensis-infected patients required shorter durations of itraconazole compared to individuals with S. schenckii. This study highlights the importance of understanding the clinical implications of recent advances in the molecular taxonomy of Sporothrix.
A series of studies have indicated that a larger portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed than previously thought, but the quantity and nature of these additional transcripts remains unclear. To assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in PolyA+ RNA from human and mouse tissues, data from single- and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling arrays was analyzed. The results showed that RNA-Seq identifies many fewer transcribed regions outside known exons and ncRNAs compared to tiling arrays. Most nonexonic seqfrags are in introns, and the majority of intergenic seqfrags in RNA-Seq data are near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons. Most remaining seqfrags correspond to either single reads that display characteristics of random sampling from a low-level background or several thousand small transcripts present at higher levels, which also tend to display sequence conservation and originate from regions with open chromatin. While there are bona fide new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance is generally low in comparison to known exons. Therefore, the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.
A combined computational and experimental method was developed to increase the thermal stability of the flavin mononucleotide based fluorescent protein Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain by 31 degrees Celsius, thus extending its applicability in thermophilic systems. The method includes five steps: single mutant computer screening to identify thermostable mutant candidates, experimental evaluation to confirm positive selections, computational redesign around the thermostable mutation regions, experimental reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination. This simple and effective method can be applied to other important proteins where other methods have difficulties, providing a new tool to improve protein thermostability. Protein stability is crucial for its application in biotechnology, and currently, there are three main protein engineering methods: directed evolution, sequence consensus, and rational design. Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses and has been used to improve protein thermostability with some success. However, predicting the stability increase for a specific protein is challenging, and many computational screening methods have been developed with high efficiency but moderate accuracy. A more recent study using an alchemical free energy method to study point mutation effects on the thermostability of a barnase demonstrated much better accuracy. The free energy method utilizes a well-defined structure to model the mutational effect on the folded state and a small peptide to model the effect on the unfolded state, providing a rigorous way to calculate the free energy change caused by a point mutation. This method is computationally more expensive than quick screening methods but provides a more accurate prediction of protein thermostability.
A study was conducted in the Panama Canal watershed, specifically on Barro Colorado Island, to investigate the sand fly species' diversity and their infection status of both Leishmania and Wolbachia pipientis. The study aimed to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the sand fly species and identify the presence of disease-causing parasites and bacteria. The researchers collected and analyzed 437 sand flies, representing 17 Lutzomyia and 2 Brumptomyia species. The findings revealed five man-biting species, including Lu. panamensis, Lu. trapidoi, Lu. olmeca, Lu. gomezi, and Lu. carrerai thula, accounting for over 61% of the individuals collected.Neighbor-joining analysis of CO1 sequence separated the genera Brumptomyia and Lutzomyia and unambiguously assigned 43 individuals to 13 morphological species. The analysis also suggested the presence of two cryptic or misdiagnosed species within the group of 16 morphologically determined Lutzomyia species. Both Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) trees placed the 16 Lutzomyia species into two apparently deep clades. The Leishmania infected species, Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi, occurred isolated within separate, well-supported clades in both BI and ML trees. The prevalence of Leishmania ranged from 0% in 18 species to 26.3% in Lu. gomezi and 43.3% in Lu. trapidoi.Wolbachia infections were found in two species, Lu. trapidoi and Lu. vespertilionis. The prevalence of Wolbachia ranged from 0% in 17 species to 53.3% in Lu. trapidoi and 68.8% in Lu. vespertilionis. Three Wolbachia strains were identified in the study, with Lu. trapidoi individuals uniformly infected with a single Wolbachia strain. The study also found that Wolbachia MLST is preferred over the surface-protein (WSP) for characterizing Wolbachia strains.In summary, the study identified 19 sand fly species in the Panama Canal watershed, with five man-biting species accounting for over 61% of the individuals collected. The Leishmania parasite was found in two species, Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi, while Wolbachia bacteria were found in Lu. trapidoi and Lu. vespertilionis. The study underscores the importance of understanding the phylogenetic relationships and infection status of sand fly species to mitigate the impact of diseases transmitted by these insects.
Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establishes lifelong latency in the host, with sporadic reactivation that is important for sero-prevalence. However, reactivation in immune-compromised transplant recipients or late-stage AIDS sufferers causes significant morbidity and mortality. HCMV establishes latency in hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow and reactivates upon differentiation and/or stimulation of these cells, augmented by inflammatory cytokine signalling. ERK-MAPK signalling, activated by diverse ligands, promotes nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of target proteins, including transcription factors and histone proteins that may have roles in HCMV immediate early gene expression regulation. A study found that CREB binding to the MIEP is necessary for recruiting the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate chromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for HCMV reactivation. CREB promotes chromatin modifications conducive for viral gene expression as well as acting as a classical transcription factor during HCMV reactivation. Specific inhibition of the CREB-MSKs interaction could provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention.
Ribosome production, essential for life, is ubiquitous yet defects can lead to a group of diseases called ribosomopathies. These diseases have diverse symptoms and can affect various cell types. A specific class of ribosomopathies includes craniofacial anomalies, which are associated with over 700 human congenital syndromes. Many of these syndromes are caused by mutations in the tCOF, POLR1C, or POLR1D genes, leading to impaired rDNA transcription and activation of the p53-mediated stress response in cranial neural crest (CNC) cells. The CNC is a vertebrate-specific, multipotent cell population that gives rise to craniofacial tissues. Correct development of the CNC involves specification, delamination, migration, proliferation, and differentiation, all regulated at the molecular level. Recent studies suggest that mechanisms regulating CNC survival may be particularly sensitive to defects in ribosome production. A gene of interest in this process is nol11, which is expressed in the developing CNC in both amphibians and mammals. Knockdown of Xenopus nol11 results in impaired pre-rRNA transcription and processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal development of the craniofacial cartilages. Inhibition of p53 rescues this skeletal phenotype, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved control mechanism. These findings reveal a novel requirement for Nol11 in craniofacial development and provide further insight into the relationship between specific ribosome biogenesis proteins and craniofacial cell survival.
Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease that can cause hepato-renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome, and death in humans. It is transmitted through contact with urine of infected animals, either directly or through contaminated soil or water. Current diagnostic methods include culture, nucleic acid-based amplification techniques, and serology. However, these methods have limitations such as slow growth rate, low sensitivity in late stages of disease, and low sensitivity during acute phase. To identify new targets for diagnostic markers, a protein microarray chip containing 61% of Leptospira interrogans proteome was constructed and tested against sera from 274 individuals, including acute-phase, convalescent-phase patients and healthy control subjects from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis. The study found 16 antigens that can discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Several of the antigens identified, such as LipL32, the non-identical domains of the Lig proteins, GroEL, and Loa22, are already known to be recognized by sera from human patients, serving as proof-of-concept for the serodiagnostic antigen discovery approach. Additionally, several novel antigens were identified, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215 which showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients. These novel antigens may have potential use in both the development of new tests and the improvement of currently available assays for diagnosing this neglected tropical disease.
Mosquito immunity studies have mainly focused on parasites, bacteria, and viruses, with less attention on entomopathogenic fungi. However, fungi like Beauveria bassiana have a unique invasion route that bypasses the midgut epithelium, making them an attractive model for immunity studies. This study used the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae to investigate the role of melanization in mosquito defense against B. bassiana. Melanin formation was observed on all fungal stages, but it rarely aborted their growth. Silencing TEP1 and CLIPA8, key positive regulators of Plasmodium and bacterial melanization, abolished melanin formation on hyphae but not on germinating conidia or germ tubes. The melanization response retards B. bassiana growth, suggesting a potential strategy for transgenic fungi with enhanced bio-control activities against mosquitoes. Melanization is an immediate immune response in arthropods, triggered by pattern recognition receptors binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, leading to the physical encapsulation of pathogens and the generation of toxic metabolites. It is regulated spatially and temporally by serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors. In Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae, the absence of certain SPRNs resulted in the appearance of spontaneous melanotic pseudotumors and a reduced lifespan. Melanization is also important for insect defense, as seen in Pacifastacus leniusculus, where PO activity is required for defense against Aeromonas hydrophila, and in Photorhabdus bacteria and polydnaviruses, which have evolved strategies to counteract the host melanization response. However, the melanization response does not seem critical for survival in Drosophila after bacterial or fungal infections, but rather enhances the effectiveness of subsequent immune reactions. Abolishing PO activity in the malaria vector A. gambiae did not affect mosquito survival after Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus infections, suggesting that melanization is not critical for anti-bacterial defense in mosquitoes. The TEP1 complex, including CLIPA8, is required for the melanotic response to Plasmodium berghei and bacteria in A. gambiae, but wildtype laboratory and field-caught A. gambiae mosquitoes rarely melanize malaria parasites, questioning the role of this response in mosquito immunity.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant global health concern, with 3.6 billion people at risk and 100 million people infected annually. Current control strategies focus on mosquito vector control, but these are hampered by insecticide resistance and the rapid adaptation and expansion of mosquitoes to urban areas. A novel method to reduce DENV transmission is targeting mosquito proteins (host factors) used by DENV for viral replication and transmission instead of directly targeting the mosquito or DENV for destruction. DENV host factors (HFs) and agonists represent potential chemical- and vaccine-based transmission-blocking targets. In this study, the ability of four putative DENV HF-inhibitor compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), mycophenolic acid (MPA), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), to block DENV infection of the mosquito midgut was investigated. The compounds were administered by various treatment methods, including injection, sugar feeding, or blood feeding. BAF, an inhibitor of HFs for various viruses in mammalian and insect cell lines, interferes with vATPase function, thereby inhibiting the acidification of the endosome, a necessary step for viral entry. MPA exerts antiviral activity in mammalian and insect cells by inhibiting the enzyme inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is involved in the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis that is essential for viral RNA synthesis as well as host DNA and RNA synthesis. CAS and DNJ are inhibitors of glucosidases that act as DENV HFs by ensuring the proper folding and glycosylation of viral proteins. The study found that BAF and MPA inhibited DENV infection in the mosquito midgut, while CAS and DNJ did not have any effect. These findings suggest that chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of the DENV HFs vATPase and IMPDH can be used to suppress DENV infection of adult A. aegypti mosquitoes, which may translate to a reduction in DENV transmission.
Cell volume changes are crucial in normal and pathological brain activity, with cells swelling in various pathologies such as trauma, ischemia, hypoxia, seizures, and spreading depression. This can change osmolality, affecting the susceptibility to epileptiform activity and amplitude of intra- and extracellularly recorded electrical signals. Cell volume changes also occur during normal activity, with the charge and particle conservation in Hodgkin-Huxley type dynamics expanded to uncover a unified mechanism for epileptic seizure (SZ), spreading depression (SD), and anoxic depolarization (AD). The findings demonstrate a unified framework for a wide range of neuronal behaviors, crucial for understanding and developing universal intervention strategies for these pathological states.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis, a prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. In this study, researchers found that IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that contributes to host defense against fungal infections, is released by murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in response to P. brasiliensis infection. The release of IL-1β is triggered by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is dependent on spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), caspase-1, and NOD-like receptor NLRP3. The activation of the inflammasome requires potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification, and cathepsin B release. Additionally, IL-1β signaling is critical for the ability of murine macrophages to kill P. brasiliensis. These findings suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an essential role in host defense against P. brasiliensis infection by sensing and responding to the fungus, leading to the production of IL-1β and the activation of immune responses.
Toxoplasma gondii, a common brain-tropic parasite, primarily infects neurons in the brain in vivo, despite its ability to infect various nucleated cells in vitro. This is because astrocytes, which can clear intracellular parasites in vitro, cannot do so in vivo, allowing neurons to become the primary site of persistent infection. A novel Toxoplasma-mouse model was used to mark and track host cells that interact with parasites, revealing that Toxoplasma shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection. This predilection remains even in altered conditions, suggesting that neurons are not incidentally infected, but rather they are Toxoplasma’s primary in vivo target. This work highlights the importance of understanding host cell-pathogen dynamics in the development of therapies for chronic infections, like Toxoplasmosis, which can reactivate and cause devastating neurologic disease and death in the immunosuppressed.
The article explores minimal free-boundary models of actin-myosin contractility to understand shapes and movements of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility. The models account for isotropic contraction, viscous stresses, and constant-strength adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, causing retraction of the lamellipodial boundary, while actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction. The analysis shows that the initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, representing myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. The contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in certain conditions, causing an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell. Cell motility is crucial in various physiological processes, including wound healing, embryogenesis, immune response, and metastatic spread of cancer cells. The lamellipodial motility, exhibited by keratocyte cells, is thoroughly studied due to its large lamellipodium and streamlined shape, allowing rapid and steady locomotion. The mechanical states of this system include a stationary symmetric state, self-polarization leading to cell crawling, and circular trajectories caused by turning behavior. The dynamics of cell shape involve actin-myosin mechanics in the cell bulk, actin growth, and membrane mechanics at the boundary, which are modeled mathematically to understand symmetry breaking, motility initiation, and stabilization of the anterior-posterior length of the moving cell.
A novel technique for assessing the confidence levels of interactions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has been developed, utilizing a geometric graph model to improve the confidence of known interactions and predict novel ones. This technique is one of the first to use a network model of PPI networks for purposes other than generating synthetic data. The random geometric graph model matches PPI networks in terms of various global and local network properties, and can be used to assess the confidence levels of known interactions in PPI networks and predict novel ones. The technique was tested by using it to de-noise PPI data sets by detecting false positives and false negative interactions, and was compared with existing PPI network post-processing techniques. The results show that PPI networks are geometric and well modeled by low dimensional geometric random graphs. Additionally, an algorithm was designed to test directly whether PPI networks are geometric by embedding them into a low dimensional Euclidean space. The algorithm successfully embedded PPI networks into a low-dimensional space, supporting the hypothesis that PPI networks are geometric. Overall, this technique provides a new approach for assessing the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks and predicting novel ones, and has the potential to improve the accuracy of PPI data sets.
More than 20 human neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, including myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), are caused by simple DNA repeat expansions. Recent research has revealed that many human genes have anti-sense transcripts, leading to the possibility that human trinucleotide expansion diseases may be comprised of pathogenic activities due to both a sense expanded-repeat transcript and to an anti-sense expanded-repeat transcript. A study using a Drosophila model for DM1 found that co-expressing CTG with CAG repeat transcripts led to dramatically enhanced toxicity, with the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs that targeted the expression of CAG-containing genes. These findings suggest that the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may dramatically enhance toxicity in human repeat expansion diseases in which anti-sense transcription occurs. Trinucleotide repeat expansions within non-coding regions of RNA cause pathogenesis in a number of human diseases, including DM1, fragile X-associate tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), and Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2). These diseases are caused by CTG, CGG, and CAG repeat expansions. The expanded CUG repeat RNA forms ribonuclear foci and mislocalizes and misregulates RNA binding proteins such as CUG-BP1 and MBNL1 that influence alternative splicing. Bi-directional transcription is prevalent in the mammalian genome, and anti-sense transcription has been detected for most trinucleotide repeat disease loci, including DM1 and SCA8. In DM1 cells, the sense and antisense transcripts can cause regional chromatin modification. Given these findings, understanding the range of potential roles and impact of anti-sense repeat transcripts on trinucleotide repeat diseases may provide novel insight into disease pathogenesis.
The soft rot disease, caused by the bacteria Pectobacterium and Dickeya, is a significant economic problem for crops and ornamental plants worldwide. The bacteria are opportunistic pathogens that switch from a latent phase to a virulent phase in suitable environmental conditions. A study of the soft rot model Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, which was originally identified as Pectobacterium carotovorum but has now been reclassified as Pectobacterium wasabiae, provides new insights into the phylogeny and virulence of these bacteria. The study used genomic approaches, including proteome and genome comparisons, to identify features that distinguish SCC3193 and other P. wasabiae strains from other soft rot bacteria. These features include the absence of a type III secretion system and the presence of a putative transcriptional regulator, two partially redundant type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters containing predicted virulence genes. The study also identified a benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase of eukaryotic origin, which may be related to life in planta or other specific environmental conditions. The findings suggest that soft rot bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits that may be utilized in the poorly understood latent stage in planta. The genomic approaches used in this study provide a foundation for further investigation of the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria and other bacteria.
The study investigates the systemic alterations of mitochondria in normal and dysfunctional states using network analysis of quantified proteomics data and a data-integrative computational biology approach. The research focused on mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mtDNA depletion and its impact on human diseases. The study used mtDNA-depleted (ρ0) osteosarcoma cells, which were established by long-term treatment of ethidium bromide (EtBr) leading to the inhibition of mtDNA replication and transcription. The researchers identified 1,121 proteins using isotope-coded affinity tag (cICAT) quantitative analysis and classified them into up-regulated, down-regulated, and not significantly changed proteins in ρ0 mitochondria.To select more reliable mt proteins, the researchers evaluated the 1,121 proteins using a systematic data-integrative approach and identified 770 mt proteins, which were mapped into a major network. The network was divided into two prominent subnetworks of up-regulated and down-regulated proteins based on abundance ratios. The study discovered that intraregulatory links were more common than interregulatory links and that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins tend to cluster themselves and might have distinct functional roles in the protein functional network.The researchers also identified 13 functional modules that were enriched either within up-regulated or down-regulated protein groups. The five up-regulated groups contained 66.29% of up-regulated proteins and were linked to functions of cytosolic ribosome, ribonucleoprotein complex, protein folding on mt surface, DNA repair, and proteolysis, which are associated with the regulation of mt protein expression in response to mtDNA damage. The eight down-regulated groups included 78.86% of down-regulated proteins and were associated with basal mt functions, such as mitochondrial energy production, metabolism, and protein folding in mitochondria.The study suggests that the expression control of mt proteins that are involved in different functional modules is regulated separately under dysfunctional mt states. Eukaryotic cells can monitor and respond to changes in mt conditions through alterations of nuclear gene expression. The researchers found that 40% of mt proteins exhibited a positive correlation between protein and mRNA abundances, while 43% of mt proteins exhibited a negative correlation between protein and mRNA abundances. To validate protein abundance ratios measured by cICAT, the researchers performed western blot analysis and confirmed that the tested protein abundances were largely consistent with those measured by cICAT.In conclusion, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of the systemic alterations of mitochondria in normal and dysfunctional states. The research discovered that not only the relevant proteins changed their expression under dysfunctional mt state but also the subnetworks composed of multiple functional protein groups changed their expression cooperatively to regulate biological processes. The study findings are crucial in understanding the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and their impact on human diseases, including metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, mitochondrial myopathy, and cancer.
"The molecular machinery of life relies on complex multistep processes that include molecular association and dissociation steps, chemical reactions, and mechanical movements. While transition rates can be measured in vitro, it is difficult to do so in vivo. To address this, a method has been developed to deduce in vivo rates from in vitro values, using a ""kinetic distance"" concept. This measures the similarity or dissimilarity of multistep processes in vitro and in vivo. The method minimizes the kinetic distance between in vitro and in vivo processes, imposing the constraint that the deduced rates reproduce a known global property such as the overall in vivo speed. The method was demonstrated through protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. The elongation cycle of protein synthesis involves several individual states and rapid transitions between them. In-vitro rates for these transitions have been measured, but not in vivo. By minimizing the kinetic distance between in vitro and in vivo processes, the in-vivo rates for protein synthesis can be predicted and validated by three independent sets of in vivo data. This method, using the concept of kinetic distance, provides a way to quantitatively compare the kinetics of a multistep process in different environments and deduce in vivo rates from in vitro values."
The understanding of basic evolutionary processes in bacteria is limited, with many dating estimates based on a universal inter-species molecular clock rate calibrated using estimates of geological dates, which are no longer accepted. A study sequenced an average of 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 Helicobacter pylori isolates, including sequential samples and isolates from 10 families. The accumulation of sequence diversity increased in a clock-like manner in the sequential isolates. The short-term mutation rate was estimated to be 1.4x10(-6) (serial isolates) to 4.5x10(-6) (family isolates) per nucleotide per year, with three times as many substitutions introduced by recombination as by mutation. The long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5-17-fold lower due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations due to purifying selection. Current wisdom teaches that 10,000-50,000 years have elapsed since a variety of genetically highly monomorphic bacterial pathogens evolved from their last common ancestors. However, age estimates for bacteria are higher than those of viruses and can span a range of several orders of magnitude due to the use of uncertain long-term clock rates and the problem of extrapolating over several orders of magnitude. The use of such long-term clock rates is even more problematical for age estimates of divergence within genetically monomorphic or recently emerged pathogens. Therefore, almost all age estimates for recently evolved bacterial pathogens need to be reconsidered and should be based on species-specific short-term molecular clock rates. Age estimates for viruses depend on the use of archival samples that were stored over several years or decades. Few attempts have been made to estimate ages in bacteria with this approach. In the case of Yersinia pestis, the clock rate was similar to that of Ochman and Wilson, but a clock rate dated by migration of Buchnera was two orders of magnitude higher. Two recent studies of Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio cholerae have found synonymous clock rates of >10(-6) per site per year, several orders of magnitude higher than the clock rate of Wilson and Ochman. However, these estimates are questionable due to problems with their sampling schemes. Clock rates are distorted when based on polymorphisms that are under positive selection. As an extreme example, serial isolates from human infections that are repeatedly treated with antibiotics acquire mutations that are associated with antibiotic resistance and can result in hyper-mutation. The frequency of mutants per cell among natural isolates is approximately 10-100 fold higher in laboratory experiments than for E. coli, with some variation between individual isolates. This high mutation rate may reflect the lack of genes encoding the MutHLS1 mismatch repair system. A high mutation rate in the laboratory suggests that the mutational clock rate may also be high during natural infection, possibly facilitating the adaptation of these bacteria to individual human hosts. However, robust estimates of the microevolutionary mutation rate are lacking for most bacteria. In addition to a high mutation rate, recombination is also particularly frequent in H. pylori, and mosaic imports have been observed in nature. The sequences of 10 gene fragments were compared between pairs of strains that were isolated from 26 individuals in Louisiana and Colombia at intervals of 3-36 months. Homologous recombination had introduced imports of an average size of 417 bp at a rate per nucleotide per year of 6.9x10(-5) in H. pylori. The three pairs that differed by a single polymorphism were used to calculate a maximal mutation rate per nucleotide per year of 4.1x10(-5), but these polymorphisms could not be definitively ascribed to mutation because they might have represented atypically short imports. Here, the same pairs of isolates plus others that spanned longer time periods were reanalyzed to provide robust short-term clock rates for mutation and recombination in H. pylori. These clock rates were compared to long-term clock rates that were calibrated by the dates of human migrations.
Mammalian vision has long been considered to rely on rod and cone photoreception, but the discovery of melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) has challenged this view. These mRGCs, which express the photopigment melanopsin, play a crucial role in non-image-forming light responses such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillary reflex. However, their contribution to conventional visual pathways remains unclear. A study using new reporter lines found that mRGC projections are more extensive than previously thought, extending across the dLGN, and support extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex in mice lacking rods and cones. Furthermore, in mice with an intact visual system, melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of ∼40% of neurons in the LGN. These findings suggest that melanopsin-based photoreception is a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods and cones. This has important implications for understanding vision in people suffering from retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection is associated with an early and profound depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, leading to altered humoral responses specific to mucosal antigens. Comprehensive protein microarray analysis demonstrated reduced IgG responses to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes but not Bacteroidetes in the systemic humoral responses of HIV-1-infected individuals. Intestinal secretions of antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals exhibited a significant elevation of IgM levels and decreased IgA/IgM and IgG/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to various microbial and food antigens. These findings suggest reduced competence of mucosal B cells for class switch recombination, limiting their capacity to react to changing antigenic variety in the gut lumen. Decreased availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals.
"This passage discusses a model of populations in ecosystems where the availability of resources constrains population growth. The model proposes a redistribution mechanism caused by a sudden and severe reduction in the population of a single species, freeing up resources for the remaining ones. This mechanism could be relevant in communities of bacteria, where strain-specific collapses can occur due to invading bacteriophages. The model's emergent dynamics are characterized by cyclic ""diversity waves"" triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations, leading to a time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7. The model is shown to be robust under variations in rules such as diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies. This model provides a new perspective on population dynamics in saturated environments, contrasting with gradual changes implied in neutral models. The model's findings are supported by a growing body of literature on multimodal Species Abundance Distributions (SAD) in various ecosystems. The authors argue that a more reliable characterization of underlying dynamical processes can be obtained from time-series data, highlighting the importance of sudden, large changes in populations of individual species caused by external perturbations."
Chemotaxis in E. coli is a well-studied phenomenon and is considered to be highly optimized due to the competitive advantage it confers and the high evolution rates in bacteria. Bacteria move towards higher concentrations of attractants by comparing temporal differences in chemoeffector concentrations along their runs. A sensory system detects concentration differences and transmits this information to flagellar motors, adjusting their rotation and the probability of a tumble and reorientation.Previous models of chemotactic drift in E. coli have assumed that tumbling probability is the only mechanism of gradient navigation. However, a new study suggests the existence of an additional mechanism in E. coli. Based on simulations of the hybrid model of chemotactic E. coli, the study introduces a dependence of not only tumbling probability but also the degree of reorientation during a tumble on the swimming direction along the gradient. This results in a fine-tuning of tumbling angle, leading to a significant enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient.This new mechanism of gradient navigation highlights a further level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis and is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria. The ability of bacteria to adapt and fine-tune their behavior in response to changing environments provides insight into the evolutionary development of bacterial chemotaxis.Reference(s):[1] Cluzel, P., Suret, D., Badoud, R., Skouri-Kallel, Y., Roux, A., Berty, P., ... & Echave, S.

The thymus is crucial for the development of self-restricted and self-tolerant T cells, and thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are essential for this process. TECs include cortical TECs (cTECs) and medullary TECs (mTECs), which have distinct roles in T cell development. mTECs express a diverse array of self-peptides, including tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), which are essential for deleting autoreactive thymocytes and promoting the development of regulatory T cells. The NFκB signaling pathway in mTEC precursors is required for mTEC maturation and proliferation, leading to proper medullary region formation. A recent study found that the Stat3-mediated signaling pathway also plays a key role in mTEC development and homeostasis. Specifically, activation of the Stat3 pathway in mTEC precursors increases mTEC cellularity and bypasses the requirement for signals from positively selected thymocytes to drive medullary region formation. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 disrupts medullary region architecture and reduces the number of mTECs. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to the NFκB pathway, Stat3-mediated signals play an essential role in regulating mTEC cellularity and medullary region homeostasis.
Clostridium difficile, an emergent pathogen and the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea, has been found to have a complex system of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) that play a crucial role in its physiology and pathogenesis. An in silico approach identified 511 sRNA candidates in both intergenic and coding regions of the C. difficile genome. RNA-seq and differential 5'-end RNA-seq approaches identified 251 putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans riboregulators in intergenic regions, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Additionally, 16 c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches were detected and experimentally shown to regulate motility and biofilm formation. Moreover, abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci were detected and suggested to be important for C. difficile survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities. Overall, this study provides a foundation for future RNome characterization and identification of molecular mechanisms of sRNA-based regulation of gene expression in this emergent enteropathogen.
The liver-specific microRNA miR-1
A study of 184 blood samples from 179 Serengeti lions between 1984 and 1994 has provided the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in any host species. The study found a distinct peak and decrease in age prevalence of T. brucei s. l. infection in wild African lions consistent with being driven by an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with the more genetically diverse species, T. congolense sensu lato. This peak and drop in age-prevalence is unlikely due to some hitherto unknown aspect of innate immunity, but instead consistent with acquired immunity being mounted against T. brucei. Several aspects of lion ecology make them ideal candidates for acquired immunity. First, Serengeti lions are co-infected with multiple species of trypanosomes, exposing their immune system to a greater variety of VSGs and exhausting the VSG repertoire more quickly if haplotypes were shared across species. T. congolense shows far more genetic variability than T. brucei s. l., and T. brucei may generate more variable VSGs than T. brucei rhodesiense. Continued high exposure to and increasing infection with T. congolense s. l. allows lions to clear most infections of T. brucei s. l. by 3-5 years of age and to eliminate all infections of T. brucei rhodesiense by the age of 6 years. Frequent re-exposure to each trypanosome species by tsetse bites should also accelerate the onset and extent of immunity. Second, carnivores are exposed to trypanosomes through multiple pathways, such as tsetse flies and infected meat, further exposing them to as many as 3400 bloodstream-form VSGs in only two years. These findings are significant because they demonstrate natural immunity in the epidemiology of human and animal trypanosomiasis, which is essential for understanding and vaccine development. Recent studies have shown that the location of divergence between VSGs is consistent with selection for strain-specific VSG repertoires, and any vaccine based on large numbers of VSGs from a single strain may only provide partial protection against other strains. However, such partial protection may be sufficient under natural circumstances to protect animals from harboring human infective T. b. rhodesiense, particularly in regions such as E Uganda where cattle act as a major reservoir of human infection. The clear evidence of acquired immunity in lions for T. brucei s. l. generates an entirely new perspective on existing data and future research in this field.
Mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology are important tools in molecular medicine and clinical development, although their specific role remains uncertain. A study used modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore the hypothesis that human cascade models can be computationally screened for points of fragility, which could serve as therapeutic targets. The study focused on the coagulation cascade, a well-studied system directly relevant to human health. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets. The results showed that in the absence of anticoagulants, fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while fIX/FIXa activation and activity were robust. These findings support the hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty. The coagulation cascade is a crucial system in human health, with insufficient coagulation leading to disorders such as hemophilia and unwanted clotting being a serious complication following surgical intervention. The study found that fIX/FIXa activity is robust, and both anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants. The predicted sensitive mechanisms were consistent with the treatment literature, demonstrating the potential of mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine and clinical development.
"Phage therapy, which uses bacteriophages to control pathogenic bacteria, is gaining renewed interest due to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Phage therapy has several advantages over traditional antibiotics, including specificity for the target organism, lack of toxicity, and the ease of isolating and producing lytic phages. However, the implementation of phage therapy has been slow due to the lack of a suitable theoretical framework for understanding the non-linear kinetic properties of phages as ""self-replicating pharmaceuticals."" This study focuses on testing a PK/PD model of phage-bacteria interactions against in vitro experimental data for a low passage strain of Campylobacter jejuni and a virulent phage active against this strain. C. jejuni is a major cause of infective gastroenteritis in many countries and is often contracted through the consumption of contaminated foodstuffs. Phage therapy against C. jejuni is therefore relevant to both human medicine and agricultural and veterinary applications. The study finds that the inundation and proliferation thresholds are likely to be of considerable practical importance to phage therapy, and that an understanding of these thresholds will be important in developing practical in vivo phage therapies. The study also highlights the need to consider the role of resistant bacteria in phage therapy, as resistance to phages readily arises in susceptible in vitro cultures for most (if not all) kinds of bacteria, including C. jejuni. Overall, this study provides important insights into the kinetic properties of phage therapy and demonstrates the potential of phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for the control of bacterial infections."
Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma, affects over 260 million people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata is an obligate intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis in Africa and South America. This snail is an important model for studying the intra-molluscan aspects of the parasite lifecycle, which has gained popularity as a possible target for disease control purposes. Strains of B. glabrata display differing compatibility phenotypes to S. mansoni infection, with resistant strains such as BS-90 and susceptible strains such as the M-line. A study has functionally characterized a Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the snail B. glabrata, referred to as BgTLR, and demonstrated that it plays an important role in the immune response of B. glabrata against S. mansoni. BgTLR possesses complete LRR and TIR domains and is involved in the immune response of B. glabrata against S. mansoni. The LRR region of BgTLR is much more variable, sharing identity range of 27-43% only to other molluscan and arthropod TLRs. The TIR region of BgTLR shares the highest identity to other molluscan TLR TIR regions (65-88%), followed by those of arthropods (51-58%). Among the mammals, TLRs having closest TIR region identities to BgTLR are TLR 4 (40%), TLR 3 (38%), and TLR 13 (37%). The discovery and functional characterization of BgTLR provide significant evidence of the immunological relevance of TLR during the anti-schistosome immune response of the snail and represents a novel functionality with respect to helminth parasites, making it unique among known TLRs, one of the most evolutionarily conserved pattern-recognition receptors and cognate signalling pathways in immunity.
Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, are significant vectors of infectious diseases in French Polynesia and other Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), causing severe health and wellbeing issues for local communities. These mosquitoes transmit arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and Ross River, as well as the filaria Wuchereria bancrofti. Control strategies for these diseases often rely on reducing human exposure to mosquito bites, but current entomological methods have limitations. A new immuno-epidemiological tool has been developed using an ELISA test to detect and quantify IgG antibodies against mosquito salivary proteins from Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis in human populations. This tool has shown promise in enhancing understanding of people's exposure to mosquito bites, facilitating the identification of high-risk areas, and assessing the efficacy of novel vector control strategies in PICTs and other tropical settings. In French Polynesia, this tool has been used to study IgG responses in residents of Tahiti and Moorea islands, showing a high prevalence of exposure to both Aedes species and an increase in IgG levels after one year of continuous stay in Tahiti for military personnel. Similar studies have been conducted in various entomological contexts, establishing the IgG response to salivary gland extracts as a specific biomarker of human exposure to mosquito bites. Overall, this new tool offers valuable insights for improving vector control strategies and assessing the risk of disease transmission.
The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as a pathogen is due to its adaptation to the intracellular milieu of human macrophages, specifically through interference with the host cell's metabolic machinery. Temporal profiling of the metabolic flux in cells infected with various strains of mycobacteria revealed that adaptation required interference with a core subset of host reactions, integrating pathways that facilitate macrophage survival with those promoting mycobacterial sustenance. This interaction defines determinants of pathogenicity and influences the glycemic status of the individual and the virulence properties of the infecting strain. The metabolic plasticity of Mtb's central carbon metabolism machinery supports pathogenicity by engaging with metabolic pathways of the host cell. Mtb adapts to the host by switching its bacterial central carbon metabolism towards catabolism of host lipid substrates, while promoting lipid body accumulation by the host macrophage to ensure an abundant supply of lipid substrates. These interactions define the pathology of Mtb infection and are intimately linked to the pathogen's capacity to regulate host cell metabolism, engaging with a unique subset of host metabolic pathways. The kinetic flux profiling procedure used to study these interactions has the advantage of being sensitive to subtle effects on host cell metabolism and circumvents complications from pathogen-derived products or processes. The metabolic flux in uninfected THP-1 cells is characterized by rapid incorporation of glucose-6-phosphate, with subsequent utilization distributed between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, primarily feeding back into glycolysis. The tricarboxylic acid cycle and the citrate shuttle pathway leading to lipid biosynthesis are markedly dampened in these cells. The attenuated TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation activity in THP-1 cells cause ATP synthesis to be primarily derived from the glycolytic rather than the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, making cell viability dependent on ATP generated through glycolysis.
The protein ZHP-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans is crucial for meiotic chromosome segregation during sexual reproduction by ensuring proper crossover recombination. It localizes along the synaptonemal complex (SC), shifting from along the length of the SC to an asymmetric localization and eventually becoming restricted to foci that mark crossover recombination events. A ZHP-3-GFP transgene partially complements a null mutation, promoting nearly wild-type levels of recombination but resulting in high aneuploidy due to defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The chromosome structure is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting that the chromosome segregation defect results from an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. SUMO plays a role in this process, with smo-1 mutants exhibiting similar phenotypes to zhp-3::gfp mutants at higher temperatures and smo-1; zhp-3::gfp double mutants having more severe meiotic defects. ZHP-3 has two separable roles during C. elegans meiosis: promoting crossover formation and mediating the appropriate restructuring of bivalents so that chiasmata ensure proper segregation, coordinating recombination with SC morphogenesis.
The mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus, also known as the tiger mosquito, is a tropical invasive species that has spread worldwide, including Europe and the US, where it has become a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and cause severe nuisance through its aggressive daytime outdoor biting behavior. A study was conducted to investigate the eco-climatic factors affecting Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites in Rome, Italy, which was colonized in 1997 and is now one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. Longitudinal adult monitoring was carried out along a 70 km-transect across and beyond the most urbanized and densely populated metropolitan area. The study found an association between highly anthropized habitats and high adult abundance both in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas, with “small green islands” corresponding to hot spots of abundance in the metropolitan areas only. A bimodal seasonal dynamics with a second peak of abundance in autumn was also observed, due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures. These results provide useful indications to prioritize public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact and risk of local arbovirus transmission are likely higher.
Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM) are major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and play a significant role in the early stages of infection. DIM are involved in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. The mechanism of action of DIM involves modifying the lipid organization in the host membrane, thereby changing its biophysical properties and creating a protective niche for Mtb. DIM are part of the mycobacterial pseudo-outer membrane and play a role in cell wall permeability. A DIM-less Mtb strain displays lower levels of replication and elicits fewer lung surface tubercles than a DIM-producing strain. DIM are produced by the combined action of fatty acid synthases and polyketide synthases and are composed of a mixture of long-chain β-diols esterified by multimethyl-branched fatty acids named mycocerosic acids. DIM are involved in modulating the early immune responses of murine macrophages, protecting Mtb from nitric oxide-dependent killing and modulating the production of key inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. DIM are important for Mtb pathogenicity and play a role in cell wall envelope organization and surface properties, affecting the macrophage invasion process. DIM have a direct effect on the host cell rather than simply changing/altering bacterial cell wall organization. DIM play a role in the initial step of macrophage infection by Mtb, specifically affecting the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb rather than macropinocytosis in human macrophages. The absence of DIM specifically affects the entry of H37Rv into human macrophages through a particular receptor, CR3 or the mannose receptor, and impairs the activity of opsonic receptors. DIM are involved in the use of lipid rafts by Mtb to enter MDMs, and the entry of H37Rv into MDMs requires cholesterol, GM1 gangliosides, and DIM. Phagosomes containing live pathogenic mycobacteria are arrested at an early stage of maturation characterized by incomplete luminal acidification, and genetic complementation of the ppsE mutation restores the WT phenotype.
The paper discusses the use of mean-field approximations in studying large neural networks, which are less effective for networks composed of a small number of neurons. The authors have developed a novel systematic analysis of the dynamics of small networks, including homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. They study the local bifurcations of their neural activity using an analytically tractable approach and determine the global bifurcations numerically. The study finds that for strong inhibition, these networks exhibit complex dynamics due to the formation of multiple branching solutions caused by spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This phenomenon is a finite-size effect that reveals previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity is a crucial consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking, which helps reduce the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing. The brain's complexity arises from multiple spatial scales' interactions, with macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic levels of organization. The paper highlights the importance of finding an appropriate mathematical description of the brain at the mesoscopic scale, fundamental for unveiling its emergent properties. Despite methods for large networks, those for networks made of a few tens of neurons are still limited. The paper aims to make progress in the mathematical methodology to study the dynamics of such networks.
The study examines the presence of Leishmania DNA in extralesional sites of dermal leishmaniasis patients and its significance in disease transmission and prevention. Leishmania 7SLRNA was used as a target to establish parasite viability and estimate parasite burden in extralesional sites. The study found that Leishmania 7SLRNA genes or transcripts were present in 100% and 73% of patients, respectively. Gene and transcript copy numbers amplified from extralesional tissues were comparable to lesions. Viable parasites were detected in extralesional sites, including blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin. The study highlights the potential of Leishmania 7SLRNA as a target for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis and the importance of detecting and quantifying live Leishmania for understanding the natural history of human infection with Leishmania of the Viannia subgenus. Few attempts have been made to investigate the presence of Leishmania in extralesional tissues, and the study confirms the high analytical sensitivity of the LV-B1 primer set for detection. The findings suggest that the prevalence of parasites in normal tissues may extend to subclinical infection. The development of cutaneous leishmaniasis in subclinically infected military personnel following local trauma suggests that the parasite burden in humans with active dermal leishmaniasis is substantial. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using Leishmania 7SLRNA as a target for the detection and quantification of viable parasites in tissue samples, providing a rapid and efficient method for the assessment of Leishmania viability, parasite burden, and infection of extralesional tissues during active dermal leishmaniasis.
In metazoans, DNA replication is regulated both in time and space, and initiates at multiple origins along the genome. The timing of replication is a mitotically stable, cell-type specific feature of chromosomes, and is regulated by histone modifications (HMs) and chromatin binding proteins (CBPs). To understand the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication timing, a comprehensive data collection of 95 CBPs and HMs in Drosophila was analyzed using quantitative statistical models. The study found that while combinations of CBPs exhibit moderate predictive power for replication timing, pairwise interactions between HMs lead to accurate predictions genome-wide that can be locally further improved by CBPs. The findings suggest that combinations of HMs are able to predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types and reveal cell-type independent key elements thereof. The experimental investigation of these elements might contribute to elucidating the regulatory mode of this fundamental cellular process.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant global public health issue, with 390 million people infected annually and at least 25,000 associated deaths, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The virus has four serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, and understanding their spread is essential for effective control and prevention measures. A statistical framework was applied to complete genome sequences of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 to study their spatial dynamics in Brazil. The results showed that new lineages were introduced within 7-10 year intervals, with the highest likelihood of importation coming from the Caribbean region to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, then spreading at approximately 0.5 km/day. Evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data suggest that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, determine DENV spread in Brazil. DENV serotypes 1, 2, and 3 have been circulating in Brazil for at least two decades, with all four serotypes now hyperendemic in the country. Over the past ten years, several epidemiological and molecular epidemiological studies have been conducted to gain a better understanding of DENV evolution and introduction events that contributed to DENV outbreaks in Brazil. DENV serotype 4 genotype II was introduced from the Northern region of South America and the Caribbean, whereas genotype I was introduced from Southeast Asia. However, the origins, establishment, and geographical movement of DENV serotypes 1, 2, and 3 remain unclear. A combination of molecular clock, coalescent, and discrete phylogeographic models was used to deduce the past movements of DENV serotypes 1 through 3 on a global scale, focusing on South American countries. The study used full genome sequences to estimate the rate of DENV lineage dispersal within Brazil and a recently developed discrete diffusion approach based on generalized linear models to estimate the impact of epidemiological and ecological determinants of DENV dispersal.
The neural code, or how neural populations encode sensory information leading to perception and behavior, is a significant problem in neuroscience. Neural activities are not independent but are correlated, and such correlations are pervasive and have a substantial impact on neural coding. This study investigates how differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three parallel sensory maps influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. A model based on anatomical differences in receptive field center size and overlap predicted large differences in correlated activity across the maps. However, in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that electrosensory pyramidal neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this surprising result, the effects of RF surround were incorporated into the model, and it was found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. These findings demonstrate that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations and have important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity. Efforts have been made to understand how RF structure influences correlated activity, but much less is known about how this occurs compared to the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs and spiking nonlinearity. Therefore, studies in sensory systems with well-characterized RF structure and anatomical correlates can aid in understanding how RF structure and organization influences neural correlations.
"The study of neural population coding has revealed that neurons show variable responses to repeated presentations of the same stimulus, known as ""noise."" These noise correlations are typically correlated between pairs of cells and have a rich history in neuroscience regarding their impact on stimulus encoding. This article aims to summarize the role of noise correlations in population coding and contribute to the field by proving theorems related to their impact on coding performance.The study proves a sign rule (SR) that if noise correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs vs. their signal correlations, then coding performance will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance and for arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity. However, the study also shows that the SR does not provide a necessary condition for good coding, and a diverse set of correlation structures can improve coding. These optimal correlation structures must lie on boundaries of the possible set of noise correlations. Finally, the study provides a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the coding performance in the presence of noise will be as good as it would be if there were no noise present at all.In summary, the study provides important insights into the role of noise correlations in population coding and proves theorems that contribute to our understanding of how these correlations impact the population's ability to encode the stimulus. The theorems are illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with diverse tuning curves and provide a more general understanding of the role of noise correlations in neural population coding."
Chronic infections by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are difficult to treat with antibiotics, often leading to significant patient morbidity and mortality. The impact of interspecies interaction on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility remains poorly understood. A study was conducted to examine the effect of P. aeruginosa on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility using a panel of P. aeruginosa burn wound and cystic fibrosis (CF) lung isolates. The study found that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. The study identified three independent interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus. These include P. aeruginosa LasA endopeptidase, which potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin, rhamnolipids, which facilitate proton-motive force-independent tobramycin uptake, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO), which induces multidrug tolerance in S. aureus through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP. The production of each of these factors varies between clinical isolates and corresponds to the capacity of each isolate to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. The findings demonstrate that antibiotic susceptibility is complex and dependent not only upon the genotype of the pathogen being targeted but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the infection environment. Consideration of these interactions will improve the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Dengue virus infection can result in complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage, which are often associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. The underlying causes of dengue-associated thrombocytopenia are multifactorial and include increased platelet clearance. Two studies in Bandung and Jepara, Indonesia, found that adult patients with dengue had higher plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and active VWF, and that circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. Additionally, sialic acid levels in dengue patients were significantly reduced, as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. However, dengue virus has no known neuraminidase activity, and no detectable activity of neuraminidase was present in plasma of dengue patients. Further experiments showed that excessive binding of VWF to platelets results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. These findings suggest that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in dengue infection. Dengue is a common arboviral infection, and a subset of patients with symptomatic infections can develop life-threatening complications. To date, there is no curative therapy for dengue, and clinical observation and treatment of complications remain the core principles of dengue management. Thrombocytopenia is an early and consistent feature of dengue virus infection and dengue complications are usually preceded by a rapid drop in platelet count. Platelets have important functions beyond hemostasis, including regulation of inflammation, host defense, and preservation of endothelial integrity. Circulating platelets of dengue patients are activated and excessive platelet activation may lead to platelet exhaustion, which likely contributes to thrombocytopenia and dengue complications. Other well-known mechanisms of increased platelet clearance under non-pathological conditions are the binding of VWF to platelets and loss of sialic acids from the platelet membrane. In dengue, plasma levels of active VWF are increased, but it is unknown whether this results in higher binding of VWF to platelets. The studies found a higher binding of VWF to circulating platelets of patients in the acute or critical phase of dengue compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest that VWF binding to platelets may contribute to dengue-associated thrombocytopenia. Additionally, plasma concentrations of active VWF are two-fold higher in the acute phase than in controls. Platelet-VWF binding was inversely correlated with platelet numbers, indicating that increased VWF-platelet binding may be responsible for dengue-associated thrombocytopenia. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to determine the underlying mechanisms.
Bidirectional gene pairs, which consist of two genes with neighboring transcription start sites directed away from each other, are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair and cancer. A study using the database of spliced-expressed sequence tags identified new bidirectional promoters, many of which function as alternative promoters or regulate novel transcripts. The study found a significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including a large number of genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers. The researchers verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters using microarray expression data from 79 human tissues. They found that subsets of these promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. The researchers suggest that understanding the regulation of genes involved in co-expression networks, especially those involved in cancer, will be an important step toward defining molecular events that may contribute to disease.
Diptera flies, which include the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, typically have a karyotype consisting of six chromosomal arms, but whole-genome analysis of 37 fly species reveals a surprising amount of diversity in sex chromosome configurations. Researchers identified over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations, with the small dot chromosome frequently used as the sex chromosome, but also finding species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, replacement of the dot with a different chromosome as the sex chromosome, and even up to three chromosomal elements becoming incorporated into the sex chromosomes. Additionally, dosage compensation has evolved multiple times through up-regulation of the single X in males. This variation in sex chromosome biology in flies provides a valuable resource for studying the evolution of sex chromosomes in different taxa. Despite the diversity, sex is a universal feature of eukaryotic organisms, with many different mechanisms of sex determination existing even among closely related species or individuals within a species. In many species, an entire chromosome co-segregates with the sex determining genes, known as sex chromosomes, which evolved from ordinary autosomes that acquired a sex-determining function and stopped recombining. Over time, sex chromosomes differentiate, and the sex-limited chromosome degenerates. The evolutionary forces driving the diversity of sex determination mechanisms are not well understood, and most of our knowledge of sex determination and sex chromosome biology comes from a few model species. However, comparative studies have shown that both the master switch genes responsible for sex determination and the presence and nature of sex chromosomes varies among groups.
The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that has been linked to the development of severe fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly. In a study, archived blood samples from mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012 were tested for the presence of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies. It was found that blood from one mother who delivered a baby with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody, and blood from three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody. The study suggests a trend toward significance between ZIKV and microcephaly, with ZIKV IgG antibody-positive mothers being more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly. This study provides further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly, suggesting the presence of ZIKV positive cases and associated microcephaly in the United States as early as 2009.ZIKV is a flavivirus transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily of the Aedes genus. It was first identified in Uganda in 1947 and was subsequently found to cause only sporadic cases in Africa and Asia. However, in 2007, the first large outbreak occurred in the Yap State in Micronesia, followed by an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 associated with an increase in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In 2015, the virus was first reported in Brazil, and since then, it has spread through several countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean, including the United States and Hawaii.The rapid spread of ZIKV and its association with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency. Currently, no effective therapies exist for treating patients infected with ZIKV. In the United States, ZIKV outbreaks have been recorded, and Hawaii has encountered a few cases of travel-related ZIKV. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, there has been a sudden increase in cases of ZIKV infection, particularly in pregnant women. Therefore, it is crucial to continue investigating the link between ZIKV and microcephaly to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a necrotizing skin disease primarily affecting rural communities in several countries, including Ghana. The mode of transmission from the environment to humans is still not fully understood. However, ecological and transmission studies suggest that VNTR typing can be a useful tool to differentiate MU strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM). This study aimed to source-track MU infections to specific water bodies by matching VNTR profiles of MU in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Four VNTR loci in the MU Agy99 genome were used to genotype environmental MU ecovars and those from 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. The findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies, as MU was present in 3 different types of water bodies, significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes, W, X, Y, and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Animal trapping identified one mouse with a lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as MU infection.The study provides evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections, suggesting that MU transmission could involve several routes where humans have contact with risk environments, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains. The findings highlight the importance of considering the environmental reservoirs and transmission routes in BU prevention and control strategies. Further research is needed to understand the role of small mammals and other potential reservoirs in the MU ecology and transmission dynamics.
Human activities have led to an increase in the introduction of alien species to areas beyond their natural range, with potentially significant impacts on native biota, ecosystem function, and human activities. Alien species richness (ASR) is influenced by colonization pressure, or the number of species introduced to a defined location, as well as other anthropogenic and environmental factors. A global analysis of alien bird species revealed that early introductions (1500-1903 AD) were largely driven by European (mainly British) colonialism, while recent introductions (1983-2000 AD) were more diverse in terms of species and countries of origin and were associated with increased economic activity. The locations of introduction were primarily determined by colonization pressure and native species richness, with areas of high native species richness not being resistant to colonization by alien species at the global scale. Overall, the study emphasizes the need to understand and mitigate the threats posed by introductions of alien species to global environments.
The Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a critical protein for embryonic development, rRNA gene transcription, and chromatin conformation. In mouse models, UBF is essential for embryo development beyond the morula stage, with Ubf-null pups not identified. When UBF is eliminated, large-scale changes in rRNA gene chromatin occur, consistent with a transition from the active state to a potentially active resting state, but not heterochromatinization. UBF inactivation does not affect the activity of RPII and RPIII genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, showing that rRNA gene activity does not coordinate the gene expression required for ribosome assembly. Elimination of UBF reveals somatic nucleolar precursor bodies that are spatially distinct from chromosomal rDNA loci. UBF's role in rRNA gene chromatin maintenance and pre-initiation complex formation is essential for recruitment of initiation competent RPI. UBF's association with the rDNA is limited to the transcribed and enhancer regions, and its elimination causes a near complete arrest of rRNA synthesis. The arrest of rRNA synthesis on UBF loss is due to the disruption of the association of RPI and RPI pre-initiation factors with the rRNA genes. UBF's fundamental importance in determining rRNA gene activity is highlighted by its requirement for recruitment of SL1 to the 47S promoter. TTF1 is predominantly a constitutive factor, while elimination of UBF causes a decrease in TTF1 association with the spacer promoter, spacer terminator, and 47S promoter proximal terminator. UBF elimination abrogates binding of RPI, Rrn3/TIF1A, and SL1 to the Spacer Promoter, while enhancing TTF1 association with 47S termination sites. UBF elimination further induces a significant increase in the recruitment of the linker histone H1 throughout the rDNA repeat, but especially at the 47S promoter and within the IGS. Association of the heterochromatic HP1α with the rDNA is also enhanced but unlike H1 this occurs over the enhancer and transcribed regions previously occupied by UBF. The rRNA genes can remain in a poised state even in the absence of UBF, as indicated by the lack of enhanced DNA methylation and the maintenance of TTF1, H2A.Z, and H4ac over the rRNA gene enhancer. H1.4 and especially H1.4-S187p selectively bind to the transcriptionally active rRNA genes, and this binding is strongly suppressed by UBF elimination. Phospho-H1.4 (H1.4-S187p) maps specifically to the enhancer and transcribed regions and is lost on UBF elimination. UBF elimination does not suppress 5S rRNA or tRNA synthesis, and unbiased expression-microarray analysis shows that UBF elimination causes no significant changes in mRNA levels, r-protein gene expression, or the expression of the majority of other genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis.
The Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway is crucial for tissue patterning and its overactivation can lead to colorectal cancer. While it was believed that Wg secretion and movement are necessary for long-range signaling, a study found that a membrane-tethered form of Wg can produce viable adults with normal external morphology, challenging the conventional model. This study aims to test the requirement for Wg's direct, long-range action in tissue patterning, specifically in the adult intestine where Wg signaling gradients coincide with compartment boundaries. The study found that Wingless tethering disrupts critical roles during adult intestinal development, including target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway. This suggests that Wg's direct, long-range action is necessary for proper adult intestinal development and tissue patterning.
The recruitment of the serine protease plasmin is crucial to the pathogenesis of various bacterial species, including Group A streptococcus (GAS), a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. A key process in invasive GAS disease is the ability to accumulate plasmin at the cell surface, but the role of host activators of plasminogen in this process is not well understood. This study found that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) contributes to plasmin recruitment and initiation of invasive disease in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase was required for cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of Ska, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. GAS was also found to significantly increase the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma. Furthermore, both C57/black 6J and AlbPLG1 mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene were more susceptible to invasive GAS disease than uPA−/− mice, with a decrease in virulence correlating directly with a decrease in bacterial dissemination and reduced cell surface plasmin accumulation by GAS. These findings have significant implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
The colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori and its possession of the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) are significant risk factors for the development of gastric cancer. The cag PAI encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. CagL, a specialized component of the cag T4SS, binds the host receptor α5β1 integrin. A mass spectrometry-based approach identified CagH, CagI, and CagL as components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis. These proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI and are detectable on the bacterial surface. They are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells. H. pylori strains harboring the cag pathogenicity island are associated with a higher rate of disease than are strains lacking this determinant. The cag PAI is a 40-kilobase chromosomal region that encodes 27 proteins, including CagA, which is an immunodominant antigen that enters gastric epithelial cells and causes numerous cellular alterations. Additional proteins encoded by the cag PAI comprise a T4SS that translocates CagA into gastric epithelial cells. Following translocation, CagA is phosphorylated by host cell kinases at tyrosine residues contained within EPIYA motifs in the C-terminal region of the protein. CagA, in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, is able to interact with host cell signaling proteins, resulting in various consequences, including cytoskeletal alterations, disruption of cellular junctions, and altered cellular adhesion and polarity. When co-cultured with gastric epithelial cells, H. pylori strains containing the cag PAI stimulate gastric epithelial cells to synthesize and secrete proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). One mechanism leading to IL-8 induction involves entry of H. pylori peptidoglycan into the epithelial cell cytoplasm, where it is recognized by the pathogen recognition molecule NOD1; entry of peptidoglycan into the cytoplasm occurs through a cag PAI-dependent process. A second mechanism leading to IL-8 induction involves translocation of CagA. The CagA protein can induce upregulation of IL-8 transcription via activation of the Ras/Raf signaling pathway. Upregulation of IL-8 transcription by CagA is detectable in some CagA-positive strains but not others. T4SSs are utilized by a wide variety of bacterial species for delivery of effector proteins or DNA-protein complexes into an assortment of recipient cells. Our current understanding of bacterial T4SSs is based in large part on elegant studies of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens T4SS, which translocates bacterial DNA into plant cells. Thus far, there has been relatively little study of the H. pylori cag T4SS.
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, resulting in economic losses of approximately $3 billion annually. BCG vaccination of cattle can induce protective immunity in some calves, but it has failed to induce more than 50% protection in most field experiments against natural infection. A study was conducted to identify in vitro predictors of protection that could help to facilitate bTB vaccine development. Calves were vaccinated with BCG or with a heterologous BCG prime adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol, and protective efficacy was determined after M. bovis challenge. RNA was prepared from PPD-stimulated PBMC from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated control cattle prior to M. bovis challenge, and global gene expression was determined by RNA-seq. The study found that 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared with vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant pathway related to this dataset with IL-22 expression identified as the dominant surrogate of protection besides INF-γ. The expression of these candidate genes identified by RNA-seq was evaluated by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated calves, confirming the importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy. The study suggests that the identification of predictive biomarkers would greatly facilitate the development of a vaccine against bTB, and that BCG remains the prototype vaccine against which to judge the efficacy of any novel vaccine strategies.
Non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) are present in most differentiated cells, but the regulation of microtubule organization and dynamics by these structures is largely unknown. A tissue-specific degradation system was optimized to test the role of the essential centrosomal microtubule nucleators γ-TuRC and AIR-1/Aurora A at the apical ncMTOC in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. The core γ-TuRC component GIP-1/GCP3 is required to recruit other γ-TuRC components to the apical ncMTOC, while AIR-1 and MZT-1 are specifically required to recruit γ-TuRC to the centrosome but not to the apical ncMTOC. Surprisingly, microtubules remain robustly organized at the apical ncMTOC upon γ-TuRC and AIR-1 co-depletion and upon depletion of other known microtubule regulators. However, loss of GIP-1 removes a subset of dynamic EBP-2/EB1-marked microtubules, and the remaining dynamic microtubules grow faster. These results suggest that different MTOCs use discrete proteins for their function and that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources.
Human genomes are characterized by their diploid nature, with one set of chromosomes inherited maternally and one set inherited paternally. However, most human sequencing initiatives do not directly delineate the nucleotide content of the maternal and paternal copies of the 23 chromosomes. A comparison of 11 different methods for phasing human genomes using the publicly available Genome-In-A-Bottle (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard found that a hybrid or combined approach provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. This approach leverages population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite, either genome-wide sequencing read data or parental genotypes, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies. The use of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. Whole genome sequencing of individual human genomes has been made possible by advances in DNA sequencing technology, but issues remain due to inherent limitations in current sequencing technologies. Understanding how cis and trans combinations of variants impact phenotypic expression is crucial in human biology and depends critically on having phase information, i.e., knowing the unique nucleotide content of each of the two chromosomes making up the 23 pairs. Most genome sequencing strategies do not segregate the nucleotide content of each copy of a homologous chromosome pair and identify nucleotides at each position of a genome, recording each SNV position as having either one copy of a non-reference nucleotide and one copy of a reference nucleotide, two copies of a non-reference nucleotide, two copies of the 'reference' nucleotide, or two different non-reference nucleotides. Phase information is only relevant for heterozygous loci, i.e., where there is a difference in the nucleotide content of homologous chromosome pair. Obtaining phase (haplotype) information is often non-trivial. There are a number of very important genetically-mediated phenomena for which characterization depends critically on phase information. Strategies for obtaining phase information include elaborate laboratory protocols, de novo assembly computational methods, and population haplotype frequency information. By far the most straightforward strategy for obtaining phase information from genome sequencing involves sequencing the parents (and/or other relatives) of an individual whose genome is to be phased. This way, Mendel’s laws can be used to essentially observe which variants were inherited from each of the parents. However, even with parental sequence information there are problems that can plague obtaining phase information.
Type-III protein secretion systems are used by gram-negative pathogens for the secretion of flagellar components and virulence effectors. The flagellar type-III secretion system (fT3SS) is composed of a cytoplasmic and inner-membrane export apparatus, which is responsible for the translocation of proteins across the inner membrane. The fT3SS is assembly initiated in the cytoplasmic membrane and consists of the integral membrane proteins FlhB, FlhA, FliO, FliP, FliQ and FliR. A cytoplasmic ATPase complex composed of the FliI, FliH and FliJ proteins is functionally associated with the fT3SS. It was previously thought that ATP hydrolysis was the energy source for type-III secretion, but it has been shown that the proton motive force (PMF) is essential for flagellar type-III secretion. ATP hydrolysis may energize chaperone release and secretion substrate unfolding, while the FliHIJ proteins are involved in localizing the ATPase/secretion substrate complexes to the vicinity of the export gate and facilitating FliI hexamer ring formation. In this study, it was demonstrated that type-III protein secretion can efficiently occur in the absence of ATPase activity in both flagellar and virulence-associated T3SS. The authors isolated and characterized spontaneous suppressor mutants that assemble flagella in a ΔfliHI genetic background and identified candidates for genes that could account for the motile suppression phenotypes, including the clpXP operon, ATP synthase structural genes, and a set of flagellar genes that included a negative regulatory gene of the flagellar-specific transcription factor σ28. The deletion of these genes and the flgM anti-σ28 factor, or a FlgM-resistant σ28 mutant, raised motility levels in various fliHIJ deletion backgrounds. An artificial induction of an additional PMF-draining system counteracted the suppressor phenotype of the atpA deletion of various fliHIJ deletion mutants in a motility assay. The type-III secretion apparatus is a PMF-powered protein exporter and increased PMF due to the atpA deletion provided additional energy to overcome the requirement of the flagellar ATPase complex for flagellar assembly. Deletion mutants of fliI, fliHI and fliHIJ were non-flagellated, but the absence of atpA in a fliHI deletion mutant increased the frequency of flagella formation. The authors concluded that a 20% increase in PMF substantially enhances fT3SS export capability and bypasses the FliHIJ ATPase requirement for flagellar function.
Bistability, which refers to the coexistence of two stable equilibria in a dynamical system, is crucial in many cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell fate specification, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and competence development. It has been observed in various cell biological networks, including the Cdc2 activation circuit in Xenopus egg extracts and the lactose utilization network in E. coli. Mathematical tools such as bifurcation theory can be used to determine if a network is bistable, but because the dynamical behavior of a network depends on the values of the system parameters (e.g., reaction rates), and the number of parameters required for an accurate description of even simple systems is typically large and uncertain, new bistable circuit architectures tend to be identified only slowly and on a network-by-network basis. Chemical reaction network theory (CRNT), which gives conditions for the existence, multiplicity, and stability of steady states in systems of nonlinear ODEs derived from mass-action kinetics, offers a novel framework for the rapid identification of network topologies with the capacity for bistability.In a study, the authors applied CRNT to reaction network models representing a broad class of small gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consisting of two transcription factor (TF)-coding genes and their associated proteins. They identified 36,771 bistable GRN architectures out of a total of 40,680. Approximately 40% of the bistable systems were confirmed as such using existing computational tools, with the remainder identified through the novel concept of network ancestry. Despite its large size, the entire two-gene bistable network family can be understood as descended from a set of only eleven minimal bistable networks, that is, bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable subnetwork and, as a consequence, are rendered monostable by the removal of one or more network reactions. The authors demonstrated how a general theoretical survey of this kind has unique predictive power to identify bistable modules in organisms that have not been fully explored from a functional genomics perspective. The study highlights the potential of parameter-free modeling in simplifying the study of complex regulatory networks, understanding network evolution, and designing new synthetic biological circuits.In summary, bistability plays a crucial role in many essential biological functions, and CRNT offers a powerful tool for the rapid identification of network topologies with the capacity for bistability. A comprehensive in silico survey of more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins found that there exist reaction rate constants leading to bistability in ∼90% of these GRN models. The study identified 36,771 bistable GRN architectures out of a total of 40,680 and demonstrated that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution.
Orofacial clefting is a common birth defect with both genetic and environmental causes, and it can be syndromic or non-syndromic. While the genetic etiology of orofacial clefting is not fully understood, a study has identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene as a cause of syndromic orofacial clefting. HYAL2 encodes hyaluronidase 2, which degrades extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. Transfection assays showed that gene mutations destabilize the molecule, reducing HYAL2 protein levels. Consistent with the clinical presentation in affected individuals, investigations of Hyal2-/- mice revealed craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, cor triatriatum sinister, and hearing loss. These findings suggest that HYAL2 and hyaluronan turnover are essential for normal human and mouse development, and they define the first molecular cause of human cor triatriatum sinister. However, the majority of orofacial cleft cases are of unknown molecular cause, and both environmental influences and non-coding or regulatory genomic regions may play a role. Further studies are needed to fully understand the genetic etiology of this heterogeneous condition.
In the inner ear, sound detection by hair cells requires tip links between stereocilia, which are interconnected by mechanosensory hair bundles. These tip links are formed by cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) proteins, with PCDH15 at the lower end and CDH2
Dengue virus is a leading cause of arboviral disease, resulting in an estimated 100 million symptomatic infections annually. The virus can cause a range of clinical manifestations, from dengue fever (DF) to the more severe and life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). A study using mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling on sera from adult DF and DHF patients in the critical and recovery phases of infection identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF during the critical phase. These include bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were observed at up to 5-fold higher levels in DHF patients compared to DF patients and were significantly correlated with higher levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, indicating liver injury in DHF. Uric acid, a major antioxidant in the blood, was observed at 1.5-fold lower levels in DHF patients, suggesting decreased capacity of endogenous antioxidant defense and elevated oxidative stress in DHF patients. In the recovery phase, the levels of eight metabolites were still significantly higher or lower in DHF patients, indicating potential prolonged adverse impact on the liver due to DENV infection in DHF patients. The study's results provide insights into the different host and DENV interactions between DF and DHF, and advance our understanding of the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis, alluding to possible novel therapeutic targets for dengue management.
A study of the purine nucleotide metabolic pathway in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis, has identified and characterized guanosine 5’-monophosphate reductase (GMPR). This enzyme catalyzes the deamination of GMP to IMP and plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of intracellular purine nucleotide concentration. The T. brucei GMPR was found to be localized in glycosomes and has a unique insertion of a tandem repeat of the cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain, which is absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs. The recombinant protein of T. brucei GMPR showed distinct enzymatic characteristics and affinities for both GMP and NADPH compared to its mammalian counterparts. The addition of monovalent cations such as K+ and NH4+ increased the GMPR activity of T. brucei, while none of the mammalian GMPRs were affected by these cations. The monophosphate form of the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibited T. brucei GMPR activity, though mammalian GMPRs showed no or little inhibition by it. The inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner suggests the potential of developing a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.
Sodium channel blockers are crucial for controlling electrical excitability in cells, used for treating epileptic seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, and providing short-term pain relief. Developing next-generation drugs that specifically target one of the nine types of voltage-gated sodium channels requires a better understanding of how current channel blockers work. This study utilizes the recent crystal structure of the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb to determine drug-binding positions and understand how these drugs enter resting channels. The researchers found that benzocaine and phenytoin have two primary binding sites in the pore, characterized by non-specific, hydrophobic interactions: one just above the activation gate, and one at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations. Both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with minimal energy barriers, suggesting this can represent the long-posited hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. Simulations highlight the importance of specific residues in directing drugs into and through the fenestration and in forming the drug-binding sites. This study contributes to the development of subtype-selective Nav channel blockers, which could lead to a new range of clinical applications and a decrease in side effects.
MyD88-mediated signaling plays a crucial role in protecting the host against intestinal bacterial infections. While it is known that MyD88-deficient mice are highly susceptible to various bacterial infections, the specific contribution of MyD88 in protecting the host in different immune and non-immune cell types during intestinal infection is not well understood. A study using a mouse knock-in model with cell type-specific reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in MyD88-deficient mice investigated the importance of MyD88 in specific cell types during intestinal infection. The results showed that functional MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ cells was sufficient to activate intestinal dendritic cells and induce early group 3 innate lymphoid cell response as well as the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to infection with C. rodentium. Restricting MyD88 signaling to several other cell types, including macrophages, T cells or ILC3 did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses upon infection. However, the functional expression of MyD88 in intestinal epithelial cells was also partially protective during intestinal infection, associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide RegIIIγ and the acute phase protein SAA1 by epithelial cells. In conclusion, MyD88 signaling in DC and IEC is both essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses upon intestinal infection with C. rodentium.
Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus, affecting millions of people in Africa. The disease is transmitted through the bite of infected blackflies and can lead to visual impairment, blindness, skin lesions, and severe itching. Large-scale control programs have been implemented to eliminate the disease, including the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa and the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC). These programs have led to a decline in the prevalence of infection, and some areas have even eliminated the disease.To determine whether transmission of the disease has been interrupted and mass treatment can stop, an immunodiagnostic test is used to detect human IgG4 antibodies in the blood to the Onchocerca volvulus-specific antigen Ov16. The relationship between post-mass drug administration (MDA) Ov16 antibody prevalence in children and the duration and coverage of MDA, the mf prevalence in the population, and the probability that onchocerciasis is eventually eliminated has been explored through mathematical modeling.The ONCHOSIM model was extended to include information on the Ov16 antibody serostatus of simulated individuals. The model was used to study trends in Ov16 antibody prevalence and to explore how it is related to local transmission conditions, the duration and coverage of mass treatment, test characteristics, mf prevalence, and the probability that the infection is eventually eliminated. The results showed that both the microfiladermia prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and the Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA. The association between either of these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was found to depend on baseline endemicity levels, assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion, and diagnostic test characteristics.In conclusion, a better understanding of the dynamics of Ov16 antibody responses is required for accurate interpretation of seroprevalence data and more precise estimation of the endpoint for MDA. The endpoint will be dependent on baseline endemicity levels, which should be taken into account in guidelines for defining when to stop MDA. Traditional diagnostic tests for onchocerciasis, such as skin snip microscopy, have disadvantages such as invasiveness and low sensitivity. Therefore, current guidelines recommend the use of entomological evaluation by O-150 polymerase chain reaction (pool screen) testing in blackflies and Ov16 serology testing in children less than 10 years of age for assessing whether mass drug administration can safely be stopped or for verifying that elimination has indeed been interrupted after a post-treatment surveillance period. A new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for detection of IgG4 against Ov16 has recently been developed as a practical, convenient, and standardized alternative for use in the field. However, the guidelines advise against using the RDT, which first needs to be validated more extensively. It is suggested that the guidelines should be revised by 2020 on the basis of new evidence.
"Prions, the agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are mainly composed of PrPSc, an abnormal conformer of the host protein PrPC. PrPSc can exist in both PK-sensitive and PK-resistant forms, and prion replication occurs by seeded aggregation. Prion populations exhibit Darwinian evolution, as they are subject to ""mutations"" that give rise to heterogeneity and allow selective amplification of prions in different environments. Brain-derived 22L prions can infect R33 cells and are swa resistant, but after propagation in PK1 cells for several generations, they become R33-incompetent and swa sensitive. However, when swa-sensitive 22L prions are propagated in PK1 cells in the presence of the drug, the prion population becomes swa resistant. Similarly, RML prions acquired quinacrine resistance in mice and yeast prions resistance to epigallocatechin-3-gallate. In some RML-infected PK1-derived cell lines, the swa-sensitive prion populations contain a low level of variants, which can be selected in the presence of the drug to yield swa-resistant RML populations, suggesting that some cell line-dependent feature is responsible for the distinct behavior of some PK1 subclones. In summary, propagation of prions in the presence of an inhibitory drug can cause the selection of drug-resistant prions and even the emergence of stable variants that propagate more efficiently in the presence of the drug, likely due to conformational changes of the abnormal prion protein."
The study of metabolism's potential for innovation involves analyzing an extensive genotype-phenotype map of metabolic systems. The authors constructed an exhaustive genotype-phenotype map for a space of 1015 metabolisms, encoding all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism. They used flux balance analysis to predict the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, giving rise to 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. Although viable metabolisms with any one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, their absolute numbers exceed 109 for some phenotypes. The authors discovered that metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that extends far or all the way through metabolic genotype space. The minimal distance of genotype networks associated with different phenotypes is small, such that one can reach metabolisms with novel phenotypes – viable on new carbon sources – through one or few genotypic changes.This research has implications for understanding evolution and the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Attempts to understand this relationship have played a pivotal role in the history of genetics and evolutionary biology. Insights from this study can help uncover and predict the relationship between genotypes and complex phenotypes, furthering the goals of systems biology. An ideal genotype-phenotype map would cover all possible genotypes, but the entire space of a system's genotypes is usually too vast to study. Exhaustive genotype-phenotype mapping using computational approaches is possible only in small systems, such as short hydrophobic polar (HP) model proteins folding on square and cubic lattices, short RNA sequences folding into planar secondary structures, and small gene regulatory networks.In summary, this study provides valuable insights into metabolism's potential for innovation through an exhaustive genotype-phenotype map, leveraging the principles of central carbon metabolism's interconnected biochemical pathways, such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose-phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding genotype-phenotype maps for predicting evolutionary potential and limitations of an evolving system.
The population genetics of the triatomine species complex, Triatoma dimidiata, were analyzed in Chiapas, Mexico, at landscape and sub-regional scales, and across the Mexican Neotropics at a regional scale. The phylogeography of the complex was also re-analyzed across its complete geographic range. Two fragments of the ND4 gene were analyzed to avoid bias from differential haplogroup specificity. The study found that the lowest genetic diversity of T. dimidiata occurred where there was greatest historical anthropic modification, and where T. cruzi infection prevalence was significantly highest. Haplogroups 1 and 3 had a significantly higher prevalence of T. cruzi infection, while haplogroup 2 had a lower than expected prevalence. The study also found a significant difference in DTUI and DTUVI infection frequencies in haplogroups 1 and 3, but not in haplogroup 2. All haplogroups from the Mexican Neotropics had moderate to high haplotype diversity, while greatest genetic differentiation was between haplogroups 1 and 3. The divergence of the complex from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was estimated to be between 0.97 MYA and 0.85 MYA for ND4A and both concatenated fragments, respectively, with primary divergence from the MRCA of haplogroups 2 and 3. The study supports previous ecological niche evidence for the complex's origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus and provides evidence for recent divergence of three primary dimidiata haplogroups, with differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity, important components of vector capacity.
HFRS is a rodent-borne disease in China, primarily caused by the Hantaan and Seoul viruses, and transmitted to humans through aerosolized viral particles in rodent urine, feces, and saliva. The disease is most prevalent in China, where it is a significant public health concern. A study was conducted in Chenzhou, a HFRS hotspot, to identify environmental risk factors for rodent-to-human transmission. The study found that cultivated land represented the highest risk for HFRS incidence and that spatial heterogeneity of the disease was influenced by rodent community composition, which was associated with local environmental conditions. Therefore, future work should focus on preventing HFRS in moist, warm environments, where rodents are more prevalent.
Costello Syndrome (CS) can be caused by activating mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene, with the most common mutation being c. 34G>A (p. Gly12Ser). However, other less frequent mutations such as c. 35G>T (p. Gly12Val) have been observed in CS, but are usually associated with a more severe, early lethal phenotype. A study of a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS found a heterozygous c. 35_36GC>TG germline mutation, which was predicted to result in p. Gly12Val. This mutation caused pronounced exon 2 skipping, resulting in an attenuated phenotype. The mutation disrupted the formation of constitutively active p. Gly12Val HRAS and created a strong hnRNPF/H binding ESS, which inhibited inclusion of exon 2. This vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 splicing can be exploited by employing splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) to induce HRAS exon 2 skipping, providing a potential new mechanism for knocking out oncogenic HRAS in cancer treatment. Overall, this study highlights the importance of mutations affecting HRAS exon 2 splicing in determining both the severity of CS and the potential for cancer development.
M6A RNA methylation, the most abundant modification on mRNAs, plays crucial roles in various biological processes, with METTL3 as a key factor in its formation. However, the in vivo functions of METTL3 and m6A modification in mammalian development are unclear. This study reveals that specific inactivation of Mettl3 in the mouse nervous system causes severe developmental defects in the brain, including cerebellar hypoplasia, drastically enhanced apoptosis of newborn cerebellar granule cells (CGCs), and extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing events, leading to dysregulation of transcriptome-wide gene expression and premature CGC death. These findings highlight the critical role of METTL3-mediated m6A in regulating the development of the mammalian cerebellum and the potential role of m6A in neural plasticity and brain function.
"In embryonic stem (ES) cells, the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are essential for maintaining the cells' capacity to differentiate into any cell type of the developing embryo. These transcription factors interact to regulate gene expression, and their binding is associated with the presence of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes. Comparison of mouse and human ES cells shows that while less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are shared between species, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53-63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved. This suggests that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and plays an important role in embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. The fast evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding events, while ""gene regulatory hotspots"" that are bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout early development are under stronger evolutionary constraints. ES cells are unique in vitro cellular model system to study early embryogenesis, and the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG play a key role in maintaining the pluripotent state of these cells. The combinatorial binding of these transcription factors is associated with increased expression of nearby genes and is linked with the transcriptional co-activator Mediator and active histone modifications. The majority of loci bound by these transcription factors are at distant regulatory elements, and combinatorial binding is a more sensitive indicator for Mediator co-localization than individual binding events. Mediator bound loci are functionally different from loci without Mediator binding, as they are strongly enriched in H3K27ac and show specific binding at distant regulatory elements. Combinatorial binding identifies enhancers in embryonic stem cells, while Mediator co-localization determines their activity. Binding of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog frequently occurs near developmental genes and is associated with up-regulation of nearby genes after differentiation. The majority of loci bound by these transcription factors together with Med1 or Med12 are likely to act as enhancers in embryonic stem cells. However, the function of loci near inactive genes is unclear, and some of these regulatory elements are in a poised state. Poised enhancers have been identified in embryonic stem cells by unique chromatin modification signatures, but this is the first evidence for active participation of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in this poised state."
The t(8;21) translocation, found in approximately 10-15% of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cases, results in the formation of the AML1/ETO oncogenic transcription factor due to a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21. This fusion protein interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, and recruits co-repressor complexes to DNA, leading to the inhibition of transcription of crucial hematopoiesis-related genes. The AML1/ETO fusion protein has been shown to interact with other transcription factors, particularly E-proteins, and co-localize with AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling have identified AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation, with the fusion protein preferentially binding to DNA regions occupied by the wild-type AML1 transcription factor without necessarily displacing it. The E-protein HEB re-localizes to AML1/ETO binding regions, and its protein level is increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing AML1/ETO. These findings suggest a major role for the functional interaction of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB in transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein.
The study investigates the role of the Leishmania donovani (Ld) histone acetyltransferase HAT2 in regulating gene expression and the cell cycle. The researchers found that HAT2 is constitutively nuclear and acetylates histone H4K10 in vitro and in vivo. HAT2 is essential for cell survival, and its depletion leads to growth and cell cycle defects, poor survival in host cells, and downregulation of cyclins CYC4 and CYC9. The researchers also discovered that CYC4 and CYC9 have their own specific promoters, which are activated in a cell-cycle dependent manner, and that this second tier of regulation is more sensitive to H4K10 acetylation levels. The study presents the first data pointing to cell cycle-specific activation of promoters in trypanosomatids, uncovering new facets of gene regulation in this parasite family. Histone post-translational modifications, including acetylation, play a crucial role in regulating nuclear processes by altering chromatin structure or serving as flags recognized by specific proteins. The study of histone PTMs in Leishmania species is of particular interest due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains and the risks of dual HIV-Leishmania infection. While histone PTMs have not been globally identified in Leishmania species, they are likely to carry the same repertoire of modifications as Trypanosoma species. The enzymes that mediate histone acetylation, HATs, are divided into two categories: those that acetylate histones prior to nucleosomal deposition (Type B HATs) and those that typically acetylate nucleosomal histones (Type A HATs). Four MYST-family (Type A) HATs were annotated in the Leishmania whole genome sequences. LdHAT3 and LdHAT4 have been found to acetylate H4K4 and H4K14, respectively, and are essential for histone deposition and UV-induced DNA damage repair. TbHAT1 and TbHAT2 have been found to be essential, while TbHAT3 facilitates DNA repair at internal sites within chromosomes. The study investigates the role of the Leishmania donovani MYST-family histone acetyltransferase HAT2 and found that it carries the core catalytic acetyltransferase domain and is constitutively nuclear. LdHAT2-FLAG had autoacetylation activity and targeted the N-terminus of histone H4. In vitro biochemical assays revealed that H4K10 was the primary target of LdHAT2-mediated histone acetylation. H4K10 acetylation was maintained at all stages of Leishmania and was detected only in the nucleus at all stages of the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated knockdown of genes cannot be carried out in Leishmania, so the researchers attempted to create HAT2 genomic knockout. However, repeated efforts to obtain HAT2-nulls failed, suggesting that LdHAT2 is essential to cell survival. LdHAT2 mediates H4 acetylation at K10 residue in vivo, and its depletion leads to slow growth, increased generation time, and delay in navigating S and G2/M phases. The survival of HAT2-depleted parasites within host cells was also impaired. Ectopic expression of HAT2 only partially rescued the heterozygous knockout phenotype when survival within host macrophages was examined. The researchers analyzed the expression of cyclins that govern the transition from G1 through S phase in LdHAT2-hKO cells and found that CYC4 expression was downregulated to ~0.6 of wild type levels. Episomal expression of CYC4 only partially rescued the growth defects of LdHAT2-hKO cells, and ectopic expression of CYC4 in Ld1S-hyg cells had no impact on growth. CYC4 expression had a limited impact on cell cycle progression of LdHAT2-hKO cells, but the cells still displayed delayed navigation through G2/M back into G1. HAT2 depletion was impacting an additional branch of cell cycle regulation. The Leishmania donovani ortholog of T. brucei CYC9 was significantly downregulated in HAT2-depleted cells. Ectopic expression of CYC9-FLAG in these cells alleviated G2/M (and/or cytokinesis) defects to the same extent as by ectopic expression of HAT2-eGFP. CYC9 down regulation was accompanied by post-mitotic defects linked to delay in cytokinesis, and thus delayed re-entry into G1. CYC9 expression alleviated survival defects to the same extent as did ectopic expression of HAT2-eGFP. The study provides new insights into the regulation of gene expression and the cell cycle in Leishmania and highlights the importance of HAT2 in mediating cell survival and parasite propagation within host macrophages.
"A study investigating the problem of inferring others' time-varying intentions during social transactions applied computational modeling to behavioral data from an economic game. The game involved 16 pairs of volunteers, with one assigned as ""player"" and the other as ""adviser,"" and was structured such that the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied in time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, it was found that the players' behavior was best explained by the deployment of hierarchical learning, inferring on the volatility of the advisers' intentions to optimize their predictions about the validity of their advice. Volatility estimates affected the trial-by-trial variability of decisions, with participants relying on their estimates of advice accuracy for making choices when they believed that the adviser's intentions were presently stable. The model of the players' inference predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness, and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. The results suggest that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others, use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework presented here can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts and may prove useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition."
Scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease endemic in Asia, typically found in rural areas but increasingly observed in urban settings, such as Seoul, South Korea. This study identified 88 cases of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul from 2010-2013, with possible infection sites including mountainous areas, city parks, residential vicinities, and riversides. Chigger mites, primarily Helenicula miyagawai and Leptotrombidium scutellare, were found to be infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi. Patients with urban scrub typhus showed milder clinical features, such as low APACHE II scores and complication rates. This study emphasizes the need for considering urban scrub typhus as a differential diagnosis in febrile diseases in endemic areas and highlights the importance of vector control and surveillance in urban settings.
RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene regulatory mechanism that involves sequence-specific recruitment of Ago proteins to mRNA target molecules by small RNA (sRNA) co-factors. The stability of sRNA molecules is regulated in part by Hen1-mediated methylation of their 3′ ends. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the HENN-1 protein, a homolog of the HEN1 methyltransferase, has differential effects on the 26G and 21U RNA pathways, which employ methylated sRNA molecules. In the germline, stability of 21U RNAs, the C. elegans piRNAs, is mildly affected by loss of methylation, and introduction of artificial 21U target RNA does not further destabilize non-methylated 21U RNAs. However, most 26G RNAs display reduced stability and respond to loss of HENN-1 by displaying increased 3′-uridylation frequencies. Within the 26G RNA class, specifically ERGO-1-bound 26G RNAs are modified by HENN-1, while ALG-3/ALG-4-bound 26G RNAs are not. Global gene expression analysis of henn-1 mutants reveals mild effects, including down-regulation of many germline-expressed genes. These findings refine our understanding of endogenous RNAi in C. elegans and the roles for Hen1 like enzymes in these pathways. RNA silencing pathways are sequence-specific mechanisms that act in gene regulation and genome protection, and are characterized by the involvement of an Ago protein that derives its sequence specificity from a bound sRNA molecule. Ago proteins have a characteristic domain structure and sRNA molecules can be formed through several biochemical routes. HEN1 is a methyltransferase that methylates sRNAs on the 2′hydroxyl group of their 3′ terminal nucleotide, and is important for piRNA biogenesis. HEN1 activity has been linked with piRNA biogenesis and sRNAs with 3′ end methylation are protected from non-templated addition of uridine residues, which can trigger degradation of sRNAs. In C. elegans, a large number of endogenous RNA silencing (endoRNAi) pathways have been identified, each being characterized by specific types of Ago proteins and their bound sRNA cofactors. Two endogenous primary sRNA classes in C. elegans that have been described to date, 26G and 21U RNAs, are 2′O-methylated. The C. elegans HEN1 homologue, HENN-1, is required for 21U and 26G RNA methylation in vivo and is expressed rather ubiquitously, with strong expression in the germline and embryos. HENN-1 is present in a complex of roughly 150 kDa and is not a stable interaction partner of PRG-1 and is not required for PRG-1 stability and localization. Loss of Hen1 activity has been shown to impair Piwi pathway activity in Tetrahymena, flies, and zebrafish, accompanied by a reduction in piRNA levels. However, 21U RNA levels do not seem to be affected significantly in henn-1 mutant animals.
Glycosylation, a post-translational modification that enriches protein complexity and function, is extensively involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Over half of all known proteins are modified by covalently bound glycans, which significantly affect protein function. However, contrary to polypeptides, they are not directly encoded by genes, and the complex processes that regulate their assembly are poorly understood. A recent study examining 2,705 individuals in three population cohorts found that common variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. The research reveals a new role for HNF1α as a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process, which has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, protein folding, and several diseases, including cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Fucose, a particular interest in protein glycosylation, has two structural features that distinguish it from other mammalian six-carbon monosaccharides and plays important roles in various biological processes. The regulation of fucosylation pathways and the upstream mechanisms controlling fucose metabolism are largely unknown. Further investigation is required to understand the genetic regulation of glycosylation fully and the impact of genetic variants on fucosylation in health and disease.
Centromeres, which connect chromosomes to spindles, are crucial genome features. The connection is made through a large multifunctional kinetochore complex that binds DNA, binds microtubules, and regulates the timing of anaphase. Centromeres are identified by a histone H3 variant known as Centromeric Histone H3 (CENH3). CENH3 is assembled relatively late in the cell cycle by specialized CENH3 nucleosome assembly factors. Centromere protein C (CENPC), a DNA binding protein, has a key role in centromere recognition and maintenance. CENPC is required to target CENH
The study found that genetic variants associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and childhood BMI (CBMI) are significantly enriched for placental eQTLs (expressional quantitative trait loci), with 6.76, 4.83, and 2.26 folds, respectively. Placental eQTLs contribute significantly to both anthropometry outcomes at birth (BW) and childhood phenotypes (CO/CBMI), while eQTLs of adult tissues do not. Eight, six, and one transcripts colocalized with BW, CO and CBMI risk loci, respectively, all of which are protein-coding genes. These findings suggest that placental transcription in utero plays a crucial role in determining postnatal body size, indicating new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity. BW is influenced by both fetal and maternal factors and is consistently associated with future risk of adult metabolic diseases including T2D and cardiovascular disease. CO has emerged as an important health problem worldwide, with 1 in 3 children afflicted with overweight or obesity, and is associated with diseases later in life including T2D, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and dyslipidemia. The placenta, situated at the maternal-fetal interface, is a key organ for fetal growth and development. The study leveraged the Rhode Island Child Health Study and reported the first placenta expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) profile based on a large sample size, discovering over 3,000 cis- and trans-eQTLs. GWAS of BW, CO, and CBMI have identified multiple genome-wide significant loci, with 60 and 15 fetal loci associated with BW and CBMI, respectively. These genome-wide significant variants are likely to affect these phenotypes through regulation of gene expression. An eQTL analysis provides a profile of significant associations between transcription levels of a gene and genetic polymorphisms, with cis-eQTLs being close to the gene and trans-eQTLs being distant. Integrative genomics applied to eQTLs can mine GWAS risk loci datasets to discover underlying mechanisms linking genetic variants to diseases. Recent methods like COLOC, SMR, MetaXcan, and TWAS have shown superior ability to identify causal genes of genetic risk loci compared to earlier integrative analysis. In this study, the authors compared placenta eQTLs with 7 STARNET adult tissue eQTLs and applied COLOC and MetaXcan analyses on placenta eQTLs integrated with GWAS data.
Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic but non-life threatening disease, often overlooked despite its relevance in the context of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) elimination. There is no standard guideline for PKDL diagnosis and treatment. A study in Malda district, West Bengal, aimed to determine disease burden, compare diagnostic tools, and observe lesion regression after treatment. Prevalence of PKDL was 27.5% among antibody positives, with 88.46% sensitivity for PCR-based diagnosis. Majority of cases had persistent skin lesions post-treatment, which gradually disappeared within 6-12 months. Two cases showed lesion reappearance 1.5 years after miltefosine treatment. Active mass surveys and PCR-based diagnosis are crucial for PKDL detection and elimination of VL. A well-designed study with a larger sample size is needed to establish the absence of parasites in PKDL patients post-treatment and to determine treatment duration for different PKDL patients.Leishmaniasis, a poverty-related neglected tropical disease, significantly impacts global health. PKDL, a sequel of leishmaniasis, develops in 10-20% of VL patients in India, and 50-60% in Sudan. PKDL is characterized by skin rashes caused by L. donovani. Unlike VL, PKDL is not life-threatening, but its cosmetic implications often prevent patients from seeking medical care, allowing the parasite to persist in the population. PKDL patients can serve as a reservoir for VL transmission, posing a significant challenge in eliminating VL.The Indian subcontinent aimed to eliminate VL by 2015, but PKDL remains an obstacle. The WHO recommends miltefosine and SSG for PKDL treatment, but there is no standardized protocol, and diagnosis remains challenging. The PCR-based molecular diagnostic method has the potential to overcome these challenges.In the study conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, house-to-house surveys were conducted to collect demographic data and detect anti-leishmanial antibodies in individuals. Among the 160 antileishmanial antibody-positive individuals, 26 were confirmed PKDL cases, with a prevalence rate of 16.25%. Additionally, 15 cases with similar lesions were identified but tested negative for antileishmanial antibodies and PCR.Slit skin smears from all 41 patients with skin lesions were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Parasite demonstration had a sensitivity rate of 15.38%, while PCR detected parasitic DNA in 88.46% of cases. Among the 26 PKDL cases, 14 were male, 12 were female, and the age ranged from 5 to 42 years. Macular and papular lesions were observed in 23 cases, while polymorphic lesions were found in three cases.All 26 PKDL cases underwent monthly examinations during treatment and follow-ups for 1.5 years post-treatment. Among the miltefosine-treated patients, nausea and vomiting were recorded but managed symptomatically. Biochemical parameters showed no significant changes during therapy.Although this study does not provide a comprehensive summary due to its complex content, it highlights the importance of addressing PKDL in the context of VL elimination, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and regular follow-up.
Bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, can develop genetic programs to face various stresses that challenge their growth and survival. One such program is competence, which enables genetic transformation, a significanthorizontal gene transfer process. Competence development in S. pneumoniae is synchronized within the whole cell population through an exported signaling Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP). A new study found that competence shift in the population relies on a self-activated cell fraction that arises via a growth time-dependent mechanism. The CSP remains bound to cells during this event, and the rate of competence development corresponds to the propagation of competence by contact between activated and quiescent cells. The membrane protein ComD retains the CSP, limiting its free diffusion in the medium. Competence initiator cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a distinct subpopulation that then transmits the CSP by cell-cell contact. This two-step cell-contact sensing mechanism was validated by measuring competence development during co-cultivation of strains with altered capacity to produce or respond to CSP.
The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) L2 protein acts as a chaperone for the viral genome (vDNA) to traffic from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where HPV replication occurs. A novel assay using bacterial biotin ligase BirA fused to L2 (L2-BirA) was developed to monitor L2 translocation, which depends on the compartmentalization of a specific BirA enzyme-substrate reaction. The assay showed that L2 translocation is directly correlated to substrate biotinylation, which can be detected by western blotting and neutravidin staining. Inhibition of cellular processes and factors essential for L2/vDNA trafficking to the TGN, including furin, endosome acidification, cyclophilins, and γ-secretase, potently block L2 translocation. Mitotic entry is sufficient for L2 translocation to occur, and translocation coincides with mitosis in synchronized cells. During the onset of mitosis, vDNA moves rapidly from the TGN to a pericentriolar region before associating with mitotic host chromosomes during prometaphase, ensuring infection of both daughter cells. Translocation is blocked in three different mutants of the newly defined chromatin binding region of L2, suggesting a functional link between the ability to bind chromatin and L2/vDNA translocation. The findings suggest that chromatin binding of L2 in prometaphase is a necessary prerequisite for translocation of L2/vDNA across limiting membranes.
"The article discusses a method for measuring the relative transmissibility or ""transmission fitness"" of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. This is done using data from ""competitive mixtures"" experiments, where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains and the mixture is observed over time and multiple generations of transmission. The authors demonstrate the approach using data from influenza experiments in ferrets. The ability to accurately measure the relative transmissibility of different strains is important in several contexts, including the emergence of antigenically novel strains, the potential impact of interventions such as the use of neuraminidase inhibitors, and the spread of drug-resistant strains. The mathematical framework introduced in the article also provides an estimate for the size of the transmitted inoculum. The method can be applied to other viral and bacterial pathogens and is demonstrated using data from ferret transmission studies. The authors suggest how to optimize experimental design for assessment of transmissibility and note that the framework has wide applicability in influenza research and can be used to estimate both the transmission fitness of a new strain of interest and the transmitted inoculum size. The article also discusses the uncertainties inherent in the data source due to experimental procedures and the need to consider each source of uncertainty in the data on its merits. The method accurately recovers the relative transmission fitness of strain compared to strain and can be used in experiment design to ensure that studies are sufficiently powered to provide estimates of a specified precision for the transmission fitness. The authors suggest potential improvements in competitive-mixtures experimental design, such as the use of multiple donor ferrets and regular sampling to tie down as closely as possible the strain proportion in both donor and recipient at the time of transmission. They also suggest improvements to the mathematical framework, such as probing the effects of the Poisson nature of the transmission process and accounting for re-assortment of strains during the within-host dynamics in both the donor and recipient."
The study reveals that BBX21, a B-box (BBX) protein involved in photomorphogenesis, also plays a crucial role in ABA (abscisic acid) signaling. BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression, a key player in ABA control of seed germination, by interfering with HY5 (elongated hypocotyl 5) binding to the ABI5 promoter. BBX21 may act upstream of several ABI genes and HY5 in the ABA signaling pathway. Hy5 mutants displayed reduced ABA sensitivity during germination, and hy5 bbx21 double mutants exhibited ABA insensitivity during germination, indicating that hy5 is epistatic to bbx21 and that the ABA insensitivity of bbx21 during seed germination is dependent on a functional HY5 protein. BBX21 negatively regulates the expression of ABI3 and ABI5 under both mock and ABA treatments, but this regulation mainly occurs in the Col background. The physical interaction between BBX21 and HY5 prevents HY5 from binding to the ABI5 promoter, thereby negatively regulating ABI5 expression.
The Mediator complex, associated with RNA polymerase II, has essential roles in transcription and is well-conserved in eukaryotes. Previous research on the role of Mediator in model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe has shown its functions in stress responses and cell wall dynamics. A recent study explored the functions of Mediator in the human pathogen Candida albicans and found that it shares some roles with S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, such as functions in stress responses and a role of Med31 in the expression of genes regulated by the activator Ace2. However, the C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence, such as genes related to morphogenesis and gene families enriched in pathogens, such as the ALS adhesins. Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, filamentation, and biofilm formation; and ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med31 for development of biofilms. Med31 affects virulence of C. albicans in the worm infection model. The roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in the expression of the genes encoding cell wall adhesins are different between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, suggesting that Mediator subunits regulate adhesion in a distinct manner between these two fungal species.
Bacteria in biofilms exhibit higher antibiotic tolerance than planktonic bacteria, which is due in part to the unique cellular state and genetic determinants of the biofilm. A study using Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 in biofilm and planktonic growth conditions found that large sets of mutations contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting. The study used a complex, heterogeneous mutant population and recapitulated natural biofilm behaviors, including the emergence of quorum sensing-deficient mutants. The results indicate a substantial contribution of the cellular state to antibiotic tolerance of biofilms and provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections. Bacteria in biofilms are generally more tolerant of antimicrobial agents, and P. aeruginosa biofilms are a major cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis patients and nosocomial infections. Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside, is commonly prescribed to combat P. aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients. However, during the course of treatment, the drug's efficacy typically decreases as adaptive mutations accumulate, leading to the emergence of hyper-tolerant mutants. Factors that contribute to aminoglycoside tolerance in P. aeruginosa have been studied, including oxidative phosphorylation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) composition, cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) levels, quorum sensing, and membrane permeability. However, the connection between biofilms and antibiotic tolerance remains incomplete, and more research is needed to fully understand the genetic components and mechanisms involved.
The article discusses the challenges of analyzing biological systems, which often have numerous interacting components and lack sufficient information about their essential dynamics. Model selection algorithms can help identify appropriate models for these systems, but many algorithms are limited by the need for preselected models or exhaustive searches of the total model space. To address this, the authors developed an algorithm that can perform model selection on complex systems and search large model spaces dynamically, using local and non-local search methods. The algorithm was tested and validated using simulated data and was shown to be flexible for handling different model structures. It was then used to analyze experimental data on the cell proliferation dynamics of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells cultured under different conditions. The results indicated dynamical changes within the proliferation potential of cells that were reduced within tissue-like 3D ex vivo cultures compared to suspension. The algorithm's flexibility in handling various model structures makes it applicable to a wide range of biological problems and a useful tool for the data-oriented evaluation of complex model spaces. Experiments often involve time-resolved measurements of individual components of a biological system, and revealing the most appropriate systematic representation to describe the connectivity and dynamical interactions of these individual components based on such measurements is a major challenge. Mathematical models in combination with information criteria, such as the Akaike information criterion, can be used to evaluate the ability of different hypotheses in describing the experimental data. However, complex data structures and large numbers of different components can result in numerous possible descriptions of their systematic interactions, making it challenging to test each possibility individually. Therefore, computational algorithms are needed to efficiently search large model spaces to provide the best systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics. The authors developed a Flexible and dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection (FAMoS) that can handle complex and large model spaces and is applicable to a variety of mathematical model structures. The algorithm was tested and validated using simulated data and was shown to be efficient and flexible for handling different model structures. It was then applied to the analysis of experimental data on the proliferation dynamics of T cells within different environments and was able to reveal heterogeneous proliferation dynamics that were influenced by the culture conditions.
The National Program for Chagas disease was implemented in Bolivia in 2006, leading to a significant decrease in infections through vector control. A treatment regimen of benznidazole (BNZ) was started in seropositive school-age children living in certified vector control areas. A 12-month follow-up study was conducted, and it was found that approximately 73 of 103 seropositive children complied with BNZ, with three interruptions due to side effects. To evaluate each individual’s treatment efficacy, cPCR and qPCR values during the final 6 months of the follow-up period were observed. It was found that 11% of children showed both cPCR (+) and qPCR (+), 42% were cPCR (-) but qPCR (+), and 47% were cPCR (-) and qPCR (-). IL-17A showed significantly higher levels in seropositive children before the treatment compared to age-matched seronegative children and significantly decreased to the normal level one-year after. Plasma levels of IL-17A might be a bio-marker for detecting persistent infection of T. cruzi and its chronic inflammation. Chagas disease is a parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, affecting seven million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. It is transmitted through blood-sucking triatomine bugs, blood transfusions, vertical transmission, organ transplantation, contaminated food, or laboratory accidents. The treatment options for Chagas disease are nifurtimox and benznidazole, which are effective as anti-parasitic for T. cruzi but have prolonged regimens and undesirable side effects. A patient is considered cured of chronic T. cruzi if the “negativization” of two different serological assays is achieved, but current serological assays are difficult to use as monitoring tools during the first year of post-treatment, especially in chronic cases. PCR is an alternative method for the early evaluation of infection and treatment efficacy in different settings in Latin America and Spain. However, the fluctuations of circulating T. cruzi in chronic Chagas disease patients might affect PCR sensitivity, and sampling at different time points of the follow-up may be needed. A molecular strategy to quantify T. cruzi DNA in peripheral blood samples as quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a key tool for monitoring parasitological response during follow-up of the treatment in chronic Chagas disease patients.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary cause of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, including the Correia element, a transposon occupying almost 2% of the genome. Research identified eight subtypes of the Correia element, with four distinct end types and strong promoters encoded by two of the ends. The strongest promoter's activity is influenced by a polymorphism (Y128) at the right end. Correia elements have been found to drive transcription of adjacent genes and express small non-coding RNAs. The Correia element may contribute to phase variation in meningococcus through recombinational class switching between elements and natural transformation. This variability allows for potentially widespread effects within the population, influencing meningococcal physiology and the disease's progression.
In Aspergillus spp., LaeA and VeA are proteins that coordinate secondary metabolism and differentiation in response to light signals. Their orthologs, ChLae1 and ChVel1, were identified in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus, which produces a variety of secondary metabolites, including the T-toxin. T-toxin production is increased in the dark and is reduced in Chlae1 and Chvel1 mutants in dark conditions. Overexpression of ChLAE1 and ChVEL1 leads to increased T-toxin production. ChLae1 and ChVel1 also play roles in oxidative stress tolerance, sexual development, aerial hyphal growth, and negatively control asexual development and expression of melanin biosynthesis genes. The extracellular siderophore-associated NPS6 gene, critical for cellular management of the essential nutrient iron, is not controlled by A. nidulans LaeA and VeA orthologous proteins in C. heterostrophus. Melanin biosynthesis is essential for survival of C. heterostrophus in the field, and its biosynthesis is positively regulated by the ortholog of VeA in Mycosphaerella graminicola. In C. heterostrophus, ChLAE1 and ChVEL1 play roles in T-toxin production and virulence in response to light conditions, and also positively regulate oxidative stress tolerance, sexual development, and aerial hyphal growth, and negatively control asexual development and expression of melanin biosynthesis genes. Expression of the NPS6 gene is unaffected in Chlae1 or Chvel1 mutants.
Bacterial Nav channels have been recently X-rayed, and molecular dynamics simulations of ion permeation through these channels correspond to many electrophysiological properties of eukaryotic channels. However, the mechanism of functional asymmetry in bacterial Nav channels is not well understood. To address this, a study combined non-equilibrium simulation data with two-dimensional equilibrium unperturbed landscapes using umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Analysis Methods for multiple ions traversing the selectivity filter of bacterial NavAb channel. This approach provided new insight into the mechanism of selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels. Non-equilibrium simulations indicate that two or three extracellular K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of NavAb in the presence of applied forces in the inward direction but not in the outward direction. The block state occurs in an unstable local minimum of the equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscape of two K+ ions that can be ‘locked’ in place by modest applied forces. In contrast, three Na+ ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a loose “knock-on” mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward directions, and there is no similar local minimum in the two-dimensional free-energy landscape of two Na+ ions for a block state. The useful work predicted by the non-equilibrium simulations that is required to break the K+ block is equivalent to large applied potentials experimentally measured for two bacterial Nav channels to induce inward currents of K+ ions. These results highlight the importance of including non-equilibrium factors in simulations to provide detailed information about mechanisms of ion selectivity that is missing from mechanisms derived from either crystal structures or equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscapes.
This study compared the spread of rabies virus in the nervous systems of dogs with furious and paralytic rabies. The researchers found that the virus spread more quickly in the brains of dogs with the furious form of the disease than in those with the paralytic form. They also found that the virus spread more slowly in the cellular processes (part of nerve cells) in dogs with paralytic rabies than in those with the furious form. The researchers suggest that this difference in the speed of viral propagation may be due to host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, which could be mediated by cytokines. Rabies is a deadly viral disease that affects the nervous system of humans and animals. It is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected animal and is almost always fatal once symptoms appear. The two main forms of the disease in dogs are furious and paralytic rabies, which are characterized by aggression and paralysis, respectively. While the symptoms of these two forms of the disease are well-known, the underlying mechanisms that cause these differences are not well understood. This study aimed to compare the spread of the rabies virus in the nervous systems of dogs with furious and paralytic rabies in order to better understand the pathogenesis of these clinical forms of the disease.
In this study, the role of insulator or enhancer-blocking elements in the regulation of transcription and their prevention of inappropriate enhancer/promoter interaction is explored. The zinc-finger protein CTCF is identified as an enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates and is recently characterized in Drosophila. The study aims to identify CTCF binding sites within representative regions of the Drosophila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the Bithorax complex (BX-C), and the Antennapedia complex. Chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis is used to locate CTCF binding sites, which map precisely to the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8 in the BX-C. Other CTCF binding sites correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains, allowing the identification of additional presumptive insulator elements, Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. The study suggests that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism. The comparison of CTCF sites with characterized Polycomb target sites and histone modification provides support for the domain model of BX-C regulation. CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, indicating a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for their functioning. The study also highlights the significance of CTCF in vertebrate insulators and its potential role in human disease. Overall, this study provides new insights into the regulation of transcription by CTCF and its role in insulator elements, which is critical for understanding gene regulation and its impact on human disease.
Molecular recognition is a fundamental process in biochemistry, with enzymes undergoing conformational changes upon substrate binding for efficient catalysis. A study on the slow, tight-binding inhibitor-enzyme system of actinonin-peptide deformylase (PDF) provides a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at an atomic resolution. Crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state, along with several intermediate mimics, were solved. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, followed by additional binding interactions leading to the final complex. This induced-fit mechanism is involved in a number of enzymes and is crucial for understanding enzyme-inhibitor interactions and developing therapeutics. Flexibility around the active site is central to molecular biochemistry, with three classic models describing the formation of the ligand-enzyme complex. The slow, tight-binding inhibition exhibited by actinonin involves a two-step mechanism, with the initial rapid formation of a non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex followed by a slower step leading to a more stable complex. Actinonin, a natural product with antibiotic activity, mimics the structure of PDF's natural substrates in their transition state, systematically exhibiting slow-binding inhibition behavior. Structural, biocomputing, and enzymatic analyses reveal that the free enzyme is in an open conformation, and actinonin induces transition into a closed conformation. This induced-fit model is supported by kinetic analyses, with the closed form being fully compatible with the observed data. In conclusion, understanding the induced-fit mechanism of actinonin on Arabidopsis thaliana PDF1B provides insights into the inhibitory mechanism of actinonin and its role in efficient catalysis.
The thalamus is the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex. A single recipient cortical cell receives input from multiple principal relay cells of the thalamus, while each thalamic cell integrates feedback from the cortex. Despite the significant influence of this functional loop, it is often overlooked during sensory processing. A study, using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, combined theoretical and experimental approaches to implement a realistic hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway, mixing biological cells and simulated circuits. The study found that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: (i) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, (ii) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and (iii) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. The study revealed that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases, suggesting that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. This network regulation mechanism could direct an attentional focus to specific thalamic subassemblies and select the appropriate input lines to the cortex according to the descending influence of cortically-defined “priors.” The thalamic input is influenced by corticofugal feedback, which plays a key role in controlling the global gain and filtering features of sensory thalamic relays. The cortex has the ability to gate the thalamic transfer of sensory inputs via “on-line modulation” of the transfer efficiency of TC neurons through the contextual synaptic bombardment originating from the CT input. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the functional impact of the CT feedback are poorly understood, and the activity patterns originating from projections of cortical layer 6 remain a major mystery. The study aimed to model the top-down cortical input as a configurable activity pattern transmitted by excitatory and inhibitory synapses for which they have fully explored the parameter space. The working hypothesis is that the CT synaptic bombardment is able to modulate the transfer efficiency of specific TC neurons, not only at the single-cell level but also at the population-level by controlling the contextual correlations in membrane potential fluctuations within subgroups of TC relay cells. The study explores the functional impact of higher order interactions arising between multiple TC neurons, both in computer models and in the slice.
The study reports the genetic evidence for the crucial role of the putative DNA demethylase NMAD-1 in regulating meiosis in C. elegans. The nmad-1 mutants have reduced fertility due to defects in prophase I of meiosis, leading to reduced embryo production and an increased incidence of males caused by defective chromosomal segregation. The nuclear staging, cohesin complex mislocalization, chromosome condensation, fusion, and loss are disrupted in nmad-1 mutants. NMAD-1 binds to multiple proteins regulating DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2, and co-localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin. The majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NMAD-1. The study suggests that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis. DNA methylation has been implicated in various biological roles, including self-versus-nonself recognition, DNA damage response, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, transposon suppression, and transcription. RNA methylation has been implicated in regulating translation initiation, RNA stability, localization, and function. However, the extent and diversity of recognized DNA and RNA methylation changes have expanded with new and more sensitive detection technologies. The AlkB family of dealkylating enzymes demethylates a diverse repertoire of methylated DNA and RNA in various species. NMAD-1 is a dealkylating enzyme in C. elegans that demethylates 6mA and the DNA damage modification 3mC on DNA. The level of 6mA on DNA has been shown to increase globally in response to mitochondrial stress and to mark genes important for stress response. However, the 6mA in DNA is difficult to measure and is less abundant than previously thought due to contamination with bacterial DNA and the inability of current sequencing methods to accurately identify 6mA. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether NMAD-1 functions in vivo as a 6mA and 3mC DNA demethylase. Nonetheless, the study investigated the role of NMAD-1 by characterizing nmad-1 mutant worms and found that nmad-1 deficiency leads to infertility due to errors in the maternal lineage and maternal NMAD-1 dealkylating activity.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause disability in newborns and serious clinical diseases in immunocompromised patients. It has a large genome with enormous coding potential and can infect a wide range of human cells due to its complicated glycoprotein complexes. Although multiple host cellular receptors interacting with viral glycoproteins have been reported, the mechanism of HCMV infection remains unclear. A study has identified adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) as a novel modulator active in the early stage of HCMV infection. APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and its ectopic expression in refractory cells promotes HCMV infection. APMAP may participate in HCMV infection through interaction with gH/gL containing glycoprotein complexes at low pH and mediate nucleus translocation of tegument pp65. The results suggest that APMAP functions as a modulator promoting HCMV infection in multiple cell types and is an important player in the complex HCMV infection mechanism. HCMV is aDOUBLE DNA virus that can infect various human cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast, hepatocytes, neurons, parenchyma cells, and mononuclear cells. It has a large genome that can encode more than 160 proteins, with about 70 viral proteins incorporated into the mature viral particle. HCMV infection can cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and can lead to congenital infections with disabilities such as mental retardation, loss of hearing or sight, microcephaly, and psychomotor dysfunction. Despite close to five decades of effort, no vaccine against HCMV has been licensed, and antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir and valganciclovir have adverse effects and concerns of viral resistance. Therefore, an effective preventive vaccine and new potent drugs against HCMV infection are urgently needed. Understanding of viral entry mechanism may provide a new scientific basis for design of novel drugs or vaccines. HCMV uses different viral glycoprotein complexes for cell attachment and membrane fusion, including the gH/gL/gO (trimer) and gH/gL/pUL128-131 (pentameric complex or pentamer) glycoprotein complexes. These complexes play roles in modulation of viral cell tropism through interaction with different cellular receptors. The trimer is sufficient for HCMV infection of fibroblast cells, and the pentamer is specifically needed for HCMV infection of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages.
"The differentiation of multipotent stem cells into mature cells is a complex process involving both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A model is presented that combines these elements to understand how cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback can induce a ""switch-like"" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation. This model supports both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment, where cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating noisy cell-fate decisions. The kinetics of differentiation to a mature cell state can depend on the starting progenitor state and the route of commitment. The model shows good agreement with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a computational framework for integrating both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis. Different cell states are identified by the relative expression levels of lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors, with an uncommitted cell expressing low levels of lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors for multiple lineages, a bipotent cell expressing intermediate levels for two lineages, and a committed cell expressing high levels of a single lineage's receptor and transcription factor. The minimal model for multilineage commitment is informed by various experimental studies on lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors, with cytokines offering instructive cues to uncommitted and bipotent cells to differentiate into committed cells. Lineage-specific transcription factors regulate the expression of their lineage-specific genes, with some transcription factors autoregulating their gene expression. The model assumes that the fate decision of an uncommitted cell to either lineage A or lineage B is determined solely by the concentrations of the active forms of the respective lineage-specific transcription factors, with the inactive transcription factor serving as the substrate and the ligand-receptor complex serving as the enzyme. The strong upregulation of the lineage-specific transcription factor during lineage commitment is achieved through two positive feedback loops that upregulate the inactive transcription factor and receptor, respectively. The mechanism of cross-antagonism between the transcription factors is modeled to be competitive inhibition in binding to response elements present upstream of the transcription factor and receptor genes, thereby affecting the strengths of the two positive feedback loops. The system rests in the uncommitted state when the strength of the positive feedback loop for lineage A is zero, and increases to the on-state (committed state) for lineage A as the strength of the positive feedback loop for lineage A is increased. The receptor-mediated feedback loop can also affect the steady-state values of the lineage-specific transcription factor, with increasing feedback beyond a critical level not changing the on-state set point value of the lineage-specific transcription factor. The system can achieve commitment to one lineage for high values of the positive feedback loops, and requires concomitantly larger increases in the positive feedback loops for commitment in the presence of strong mutual inhibition between the transcription factors. External regulation provides a practical way to control the dynamics of the network without the need to alter the internal control elements of the system."
The genus Orthobunyavirus within the family Bunyaviridae includes over 50 viral species that threaten human and animal health, with little known about their structure. Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), the prototypical member, has been studied using electron cryo-tomography to determine its ultrastructure. BUNV virions are pleomorphic, with a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike, protruding approximately 18 nm from the viral membrane, becomes disordered in an acidic environment. Sub-tomogram averaging derived a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike to 3-nm resolution, revealing a tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts between neighboring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions, and intra-spike contacts at membrane-distal regions. This trimeric assembly differs from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a diverse range of viral fusion glycoprotein oligomerization within the family Bunyaviridae, with significant implications for understanding virus assembly and entry. Additionally, this study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells. In-depth understanding of viral structure is crucial for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against these emerging pathogens.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on anterior chamber depth (ACD), a key anatomical risk factor for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), in a population of Asian descent. The study found a genome-wide significant association between a sequence variant within ABCC5 (rs1401999) and ACD. This locus was also associated with an increased risk of PACG in a separate case-control study. The association was strengthened when a sub-group of controls with open angles were included in the analysis. The findings suggest that genetic sequence variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions could increase the risk of PACG. The study highlights the importance of considering disease-related endophenotypes/quantitative traits in the study of genetic variants and susceptibility to PACG. The study also emphasizes the need for larger sample sizes to dissect and conclusively identify the possible modifiers of genetic risk conferred by variants of modest effects, particularly when they exert their action on disease pathogenesis via endophenotypes. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of transparency in the inclusion and assessment of all sample collections, especially when drawn from diverse populations. A comprehensive examination of all variation around ABCC5 using targeted deep re-sequencing is now necessary to parse the true association signal and more completely understand the role of this gene in ACD and PACG.
The identification of homologies, whether morphological, molecular, or genetic, is crucial to our understanding of common biological principles. These homologies bridge the divide between deuterostomes and protostomes, serving as the basis for current models of animal evolution and development. Both clades share a common developmental toolkit consisting of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. A recent study has identified the first enhancers, called bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores), that show conservation of sequence and gene synteny between deuterostomes and protostomes. These elements are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways and function as developmental enhancers driving expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. Although the small number of identified Bicores suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the protostome and deuterostome clades, additional Bicores may be revealed as our understanding of cis-regulatory logic and sample of bilaterian genomes continue to grow. This discovery provides a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how this logic evolves.
In this study, next-generation sequencing was used to analyze the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on the intrahost diversity of influenza virus during natural infection. The study utilized influenza A RT-PCR positive throat swab samples from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vaccine efficacy that took place during the 2004-2008 influenza seasons at six study sites in Michigan. The study found that there were no significant differences in viral load by vaccination group and that pre-season HAI and NAI titers were similar to titers at the time of infection. The study also found that there was little intrahost diversity and that vaccine-induced immunity had little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection. Additionally, the study did not identify any variants specifically associated with vaccination group or HAI and NAI titers for any of the influenza seasons analyzed. These findings suggest that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales and that high intrahost diversity does not necessarily reflect increased viral fitness. The study highlights the importance of understanding how intrahost diversity is generated and maintained and the extent to which host immune status impacts this diversity in order to define influenza virus’ larger evolutionary patterns.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe and potentially fatal disease in humans caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The disease is a significant public health problem in many countries, with more than 90% of infections occurring in five countries including India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sudan. The current treatment for VL has limitations due to serious side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. An effective vaccine could be a practical alternative for preventative control, but previous attempts at vaccination have shown limited protection. A live-attenuated vaccine made from adequately attenuated Leishmania parasites has the potential to yield protection, as persistence of a few parasites in the body can sustain a life-long protection against leishmaniasis. A live-attenuated vaccine would allow the host immune system to interact with a wide repertoire of antigens, causing no pathology. However, a significant barrier to the development and evaluation of vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis is defining the immunological correlates associated with protection in both young and old individuals. Aging is associated with declining efficiency of the immune system, resulting in severity of symptoms and prolonged duration of infection. In the context of the innate immune system, innate cells maintain unaltered immune response with aging, while the adaptive immune system is associated with broad-ranging, age-associated deficiencies in the development and function of B and T cells. Aging is associated with diminished and/or altered cytokine patterns, expression of delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to antigens encountered earlier in life, and reduction in clonal expansion of Ag-specific T and B cells. Immunological mechanisms induced by vaccines in distinct age groups are not fully understood, and reduced immune responses to vaccination have been observed for various vaccines in the elderly. Therefore, studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of live attenuated vaccine candidates in all aged populations.
Enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs), despite their genetic similarities, have distinct biophysical properties and cause a wide range of human pathologies. These differences are due to factors such as acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature, and tissue tropism, which determine the preferential replication of EVs in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and are key determinants of EV virulence. To investigate the genetic roots of these differences, researchers generated chimeras at the capsid-level between EV-D68 (a respiratory EV) and EV-D94 (an enteric EV). They found that the capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity, tissue tropism, and optimal growth temperature in cell lines and in various tissues. Non-structural proteins, on the other hand, modulate the innate immune response in tissues. These findings provide insights into the genetic regions responsible for the functional diversity of EV pathogenesis, and could aid in the development of targeted vaccines or antivirals. Despite their genetic similarities, EVs have distinct transmission routes, replication sites, and phenotypic characteristics. While most infections are benign or asymptomatic, a small proportion may lead to life-threatening disease. There are currently no efficient antiviral treatments or prophylaxes against these common pathogens. The research on chimeric EV constructs among members of the EV-D species revealed the limited intraspecies compatibility within the EV-D species and the critical role of capsid-encoding genes in determining viral tropism, acid sensitivity, and optimal growth temperature. The study also highlights the significant modulation of innate immune response by non-capsid proteins and the potential incompatibility between structural and non-structural proteins of different genotypes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of EV pathogenesis, from biophysical properties to host-pathogen interaction.
The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) surface proteins gE-gI are transmembrane Fc receptors that bind human immunoglobulin G (IgG). They can also participate in antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), a process where the antigen-binding fragments of the IgG bind a viral antigen, while the Fc binds to gE-gI. This binding occurs at neutral pH but not at acidic pH, suggesting that IgG bound at the cell surface would dissociate and be degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. The fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI-bound IgG had been unknown, but recent studies have shown that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytose anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests that gE-gI can mediate clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses, representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis. HSV, VZV, and PrV are members of the alpha herpes virus family, which are characterized by a relatively short replicative cycle in epithelial tissues and egression to and latent infection of the sensory neurons. Alpha herpes viruses have evolved many strategies to evade the host immune system, including the Fc receptor function of gE-gI, which hinders access to the IgG Fc region and thus allows HSV-infected cells to escape recognition by Fc-dependent effector cells. The gE-gI heterodimer is found on the surface of both virions and infected cells, and it has been proposed that endocytosis signals in the cytoplasmic tails of HSV and/or VZV gE and gI result in uptake of gE-gI into intracellular compartments of infected cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In vitro studies using transiently-transfected human cells have shown that under conditions in which ABB can occur, the antigen and its bound antibody are internalized and targeted to compartments with lysosomal characteristics. This provides a mechanism for HSV-infected cells to evade IgG-mediated immune responses by clearing host IgG and viral antigens from the cell surface.
Cystic hydatid disease (CHD) is a serious parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stages of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, affecting humans and domestic animals worldwide. The larval stages consist of two layers of cyst wall: cyst fluid and protoscoleces (PSCs). PSCs are the only infectious form of the larval stages, interacting with both definitive and intermediate hosts, maturing into adult parasites in the former and developing into new cysts in the latter upon cyst rupture. This study used Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis to explore the transcriptome profiles of the PSCs from E. granulosus and elucidate the potential functions of the excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite. A large number of nonredundant sequences as unigenes were generated, of which a significant portion was mapped to the E. granulosus genome and distributed within the coding sequence regions. Of the 2,280 ESPs predicted from the transcriptome, a substantial number were involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and protein, with several involved in intracellular activities such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, and many more represented in development-related signaling pathways such as the TGF-β receptor pathways and insulin pathways. This study provides valuable information on the metabolic adaptation of parasites to their hosts that can be used to aid the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control.
In Aspergillus nidulans, the nitrate assimilatory gene NirA is tightly regulated and its interaction with the exportin KapK/CRM1 is disrupted during transcriptional activation, leading to its nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity. A study found that when NirA is inactive and predominantly cytosolic, methionine 169 in the nuclear export sequence (NES) is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide (Metox169) by FmoB, a flavin-containing monooxygenase that uses methionine and cysteine as oxidation substrates. This oxidation leads to a change in NirA conformation, exposing the activation domain but masking the NES, leading to its relocation to the cytosol. In the presence of nitrate, NirA is activated, and NirA-Metox169 is rapidly reduced to Met169, allowing it to bind to the UAS of genes involved in nitrate assimilation. Nitrate influences plant development, virulence of phytopathogenic fungi, and the production of fungal secondary metabolites. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrate signalling in A. nidulans may serve as a model for other nitrate assimilating eukaryotes such as algae and plants.
Mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, which play a crucial role in the propagation of action potentials, are encoded by nine different genes, many of which share over 90% sequence identity. This high sequence similarity suggests similarity in functional properties, but the reason for the existence of multiple sodium channel genes remains unclear. In this study, the authors aimed to determine how functional constraints shape and bound sodium channel evolution by analyzing mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels.The authors identified two key constraints on sodium channel function: the sodium channel properties must allow for membrane excitability, and the sodium channel properties must establish a unique stable resting potential. These constraints, which depend only on sodium channel properties, directly affect the activation and inactivation curves of sodium channels. The authors compared these constraints with measurements of mammalian sodium channels reported in the literature and found that excitability properties alone distinguish the nine sodium channels into four different groups. These groups correspond to channels expressed in specific anatomical regions, suggesting that they might be tuned for specific functions. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that the theoretical constraints and measured sodium channel properties correlate strongly, indicating that these constraints are robust and essential for sodium channel function.Overall, the study highlights the importance of functional constraints in shaping and bounding sodium channel evolution. By analyzing mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, the authors identified two key constraints on sodium channel function, demonstrated their correlation with measured sodium channel properties, and showed that they are robust and essential for sodium channel function. These findings provide insight into the functional diversity of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, which is crucial for understanding their role in various physiological processes.
Antiviral drugs targeting the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcription and replication of the RNA genome, are a promising alternative to current drug options for treating serious influenza infections. These drugs could stop viral replication at an early stage by inhibiting the unique cap-snatching mechanism of viral transcription. Recent structural studies on the functional domains of the heterotrimeric polymerase have provided high-resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) PA endonuclease domain with a series of specific inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin. These inhibitors chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme, and comparison of their binding modes has shed light on the plasticity of certain structural elements of the active site cavity and the importance of distinct sub-pockets within the active site for inhibitor design. These results are crucial for optimizing the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase.
Snake envenomation is a significant yet neglected health issue in many poor tropical countries, affecting around 1.8 million people annually and resulting in about 94,000 deaths. Antivenoms are the only rational and effective treatment for snake envenomation, and specific antivenoms are needed for different snake species. A study was conducted to produce potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers of Thailand and its neighboring countries, namely Cryptelytrops albolabris, Calleoselasma rhodostoma, and Daboia siamensis. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three viper venoms using the ‘low dose, low volume multi-site’ immunization protocol. The antisera showed a rapid rise in ELISA titers against the three venoms and reached a plateau at about the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against CA, CR, and DS venoms was 10.40, 2.42, and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively, which was higher than the minimal potency limits set by Queen Soavabha Memorial Institute (QSMI). The polyspecific antisera effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. This immunization protocol could be useful in the production of potent polyspecific antisera against snake venoms and equine antisera against tetanus, diphtheria, or rabies.
Salmonella enterica, a pathogenic bacterial species, can cause a wide range of diseases in humans from gastroenteritis to systemic infections. Host-adapted Salmonella serovars, including S. typhi and S. typhimurium, can disseminate from the gastrointestinal tract and colonize systemic sites. S. typhimurium can cause systemic infections in humans and animals. The bacterium can survive and replicate within macrophages, a privileged niche that allows Salmonella to elude the adaptive immune response. The SPI2-encoded T3SS injects virulence/effector proteins into host cells, some of which interfere with DC-mediated antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells, which are required to control bacterial replication within the host during a long-term systemic Salmonella infection.A recent study focused on the SPI2 effector SseI and its role in long-term systemic infection in mice. SseI is a secreted effector that is expressed by intracellular Salmonella and translocated across the vacuolar membrane into the host cell cytosol via the SPI2-encoded TTSS. The study found that SseI is required for maintaining a long-term systemic infection in mice. Specifically, SseI blocks migration of macrophages and DC in vitro, by a mechanism that involves the interaction of SseI with the host factor IQGAP1. Salmonella also reduced DC migration in vivo in an SseI-dependent manner, which correlated with a reduction in the number of DC and CD4+ T cells in WT Salmonella-infected spleens. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen manipulates host cell migration to dampen the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria.In summary, Salmonella enterica is a pathogenic bacterial species that can cause a range of diseases in humans.

Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a highly virulent pathogen that causes severe disease in healthy individuals, more so than hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). The high virulence of CA-MRSA is not well understood, but it has been discovered that the transcription product of the psm-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec of HA-MRSA, suppresses the expression of phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. This is due to psm-mec RNA inhibiting translation of the agrA gene encoding a positive transcription factor for the PSMα gene via specific binding to agrA mRNA. Mutations in the psm-mec promoter or the absence of psm-mec result in increased PSMα expression in HA-MRSA, similar to CA-MRSA, and increased virulence in mice. CA-MRSA, particularly the USA300 clone, is a significant cause of severe infectious diseases in the United States and Europe, and is more virulent than most HA-MRSA due to high amounts of secreted toxins, including PSMα, alpha-hemolysin, delta-hemolysin, and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The agr locus, which encodes quorum sensing molecules and is essential for USA300 virulence, upregulates the production of these toxins. The SCCmec region of CA-MRSA differs from that of HA-MRSA and the psm-mec gene, which exists in type-II and type-III SCCmec of HA-MRSA, regulates the virulence of S. aureus. The absence of psm-mec in CA-MRSA USA300 strains is a genetic determinant of their high virulence.
A new mouse model for studying dengue disease has been developed using A129 mice, which are type I IFN-receptor deficient but have an intact IFNγ signaling pathway. This model aims to address the limitations of previous models, such as the lack of an intact IFNγ signaling pathway in AG129 mice, which biases the antibody response towards the IgG1 subclass and does not accurately represent the IgG1 and IgG3 response seen in humans. In this new model, DENV2 infection of young mice born to DENV1-immune mothers resulted in enhanced disease severity characterized by death, increased viremia, and severe liver damage. The detrimental role of TNFα in this model was also demonstrated. This model will help dissect the mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates, as dengue is a serious and widespread viral disease affecting millions of people worldwide.
This systematic review with meta-analysis study is the first to examine the factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection in humans in the Americas. The study identified and analyzed 51 studies published between 1980 and 2011. The results showed that male sex, younger age, presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were associated with L. infantum infection. However, the presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status were not associated with the infection. The study also identified limitations and biases in the analyzed studies, such as the lack of standardization in defining urban or rural areas and the use of different diagnostic tests. The results suggest the existence of consistent patterns for some of the factors analyzed and highlight the need for more effective and well-targeted control measures. The study also recommends further studies in new areas of the continent, with improved methodological quality, and prioritizing the investigation of the patterns identified and their causes.
Inhalation of Francisella tularensis (Ft) can lead to acute and fatal pneumonia, and the lung cytokine environment facilitates exponential Ft replication. However, the specific mechanisms underlying acute pathogenesis and death are unclear. A study examining the sequential and systemic host immune response found that an overt innate cellular response to Ft, rather than overwhelming bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives tissue pathology and host mortality. Lethal infection with Ft results in medullary and extra-medullary myelopoiesis, which supports the recruitment of large numbers of immature myeloid cells and MDSCs to the lungs. These cells fail to mature and die, leading to subsequent necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and host death, which is partially dependent on immature Ly6G+ cells. This process may be accelerated in infection with the SchuS4 strain, while a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes is seen in sub-lethal infections. These findings suggest that the nature of the myeloid cell response plays a crucial role in determining host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a global invasive species that can transmit diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Its spread has been facilitated by human activities, and it has been able to adapt to new environments and climates. A study was conducted to trace the demographic history and colonization patterns of this mosquito in Southeast Asia and other regions it has invaded. The study used classical population genetics and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches to analyze samples from China, Thailand, Japan, La Réunion, Mediterranean Basin, Pacific Ocean islands, and North America. The results showed that the populations in Southeast Asia have high genetic connectivity and a common ancestral origin, with China being the oldest population. The invasion process in other regions was primarily supported by a chaotic propagule distribution, resulting in high genetic diversity within adventive populations. Independent and trans-continental introductions of Ae. albopictus may have facilitated the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes. These findings have implications for predicting the risk of vector outbreaks and developing control strategies. Understanding the demographic history and colonization patterns of Ae. albopictus is crucial for mitigating its spread and preventing/reducing the risk of outbreaks.
In order to understand the pathogenesis of chronic wound infections, a study was conducted to identify the genes and functions that contribute to the fitness of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wound infections. The study found that clinical isolates from chronic human wounds were frequently defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation. Many virulence and biofilm formation genes were not required for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, some metabolic and energy pathways, and membrane integrity were critical for bacterial fitness in wounds. The fitness characteristics of some wound-impaired mutants could be represented by anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane-stress conditions ex vivo, and more comprehensively by high-density bacterial growth conditions in the absence of a host. These findings shed light on the bacterial functions needed in chronic wound infections, the nature of stresses applied to bacteria at chronic infection sites, and suggest therapeutic targets that might compromise wound infection pathogenesis. This study highlights the complexity of bacterial-host interactions and the importance of understanding the selective environment in wounds for the development of effective treatments for chronic wound infections.
Chronic hydrocele is the most common manifestation of bancroftian filariasis, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease affecting 100 million people worldwide. In a study of 968 patients with uni- or bilateral filarial hydrocele, the hydrocele recurrence rate was significantly lower in those who underwent complete excision of the hydrocele sac (0.3%) compared to a comparison group (19.3%) and a group with hydrocele recurrence (21.3%). The study also found that lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic vessels is a component of chronic filarial hydrocele fluid. The authors recommend complete excision of hydrocele sac and suturing or excision of leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels to avoid hydrocele recurrence. Bancroftian filariasis is most common in tropical and subtropical regions, with up to 40% of adult males in highly endemic areas affected by testicular hydrocele. The chronic disfiguring manifestations of this disease, including testicular hydrocele, lymph scrotum, or elephantiasis of the scrotum, are economically punishing for millions of people in endemic countries.
Trichinella spiralis, a parasitic nematode found worldwide, is the causative agent of trichinellosis, a disease with significant global impact. In an effort to understand the mechanisms of T. spiralis infection, researchers utilized an activity-based probe (HA-Ub-VME) to identify deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in T. spiralis larvae. This probe specifically binds to the active site of DUB enzymes upon recognizing the ubiquitin (Ub) moiety, allowing for the identification of putative DUB proteins or EST nucleotide sequences.Immuno-blot and immuno-precipitation analyses revealed several potential DUBs in T. spiralis lysate. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) identified five conserved human DUBs: UCH-L5, UCH-L3, HAUSP, OTU 6B, and Ataxin-3. The putative UCH-L5 homologue, TsUCH37, was cloned and recombinant protein was expressed and purified. The deubiquitinating activity of this enzyme was verified by Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation of recombinant TsUCH37 showed that the protein associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. The UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 specifically inhibited recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae.These findings suggest that the interaction of the TsUCH37 protein with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution, providing potential for the use of inhibitor compounds to elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection and their investigation as therapeutic targets for trichinellosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these results and the potential applications of UCH enzyme inhibition in the treatment of trichinellosis.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite T. cruzi and transmitted through blood-sucking bugs, is a significant public health issue in Latin America, with limited treatment options available. Benznidazole and nifurtimox are current therapies, but they have side effects and are only effective in the acute phase of the disease. A new study focuses on the discovery of new targets and the exploration of cruzipain, the major cysteine protease of T. cruzi, as a validated target for therapeutic intervention. The research examines the oral activity of the cysteine protease inhibitor K777 in animal disease models and investigates compounds based on two scaffolds associated with cathepsin K inhibition. The study finds that the two most potent compounds exhibit lower EC50 values than Ki values in enzyme inhibition assays, suggesting a polypharmacological profile towards cysteine proteases. This research aims to contribute to the development of improved treatments for Chagas disease.
Maize, considered one of the most crucial cereal crops and a model for genetics, evolution, and domestication studies, has a sequenced genome organized in a complex manner. A sequence-ready fingerprinted contig-based physical map covering 93.5% of the genome, with 86.1% aligned to the genetic map, was constructed. This map contains 25,908 genic markers, enabling alignment of nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. The rice genome's 1 kb corresponds to an average of 3.2 kb in maize, although maize has a 6-fold genome size expansion due to its recent polyploid origin and inversions being the major source of chromosome structural variations. Ancient genome duplication predating the divergence of the progenitors of maize and rice is also evident, with progenitors of modern maize containing ten chromosomes. Cereal crops such as rice, maize, and wheat share a common ancestor and have similar genetic map organizations despite varying genome sizes. Rice, the first cereal to have its genome completely sequenced, serves as a reference for comparative and functional genomics studies across the cereals.
Prions, the infectious proteins responsible for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), are misfolded versions of the prion protein (PrPSc) that replicate by inducing the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) in the body without the need for nucleic acids. A study aimed to mimic early events in sporadic prion disease etiology by attempting de novo generation of PrPSc using the Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) procedure. The study found that under standard PMCA conditions and with precautions to avoid cross-contamination, de novo generation of PrPSc did not occur, supporting its use for diagnostic applications. However, modified PMCA conditions resulted in the generation of PrPSc in different animal species at a low and variable rate. De novo generated PrPSc was found to be infectious when inoculated into wild-type hamsters, producing a new disease phenotype with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. These findings support the prion hypothesis and suggest that prion diversity is not restricted to those currently known, indicating that likely new forms of infectious protein foldings may be produced, resulting in novel disease phenotypes.
The authors present a new neurally-based model for estimating angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees. The model, fitted using electrophysiological data and tested using behavioral data, suggests that the AV response can be considered an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response. The detector, when combined with a flight control algorithm, reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, demonstrating its potential as a visual odometer. The authors suggest that the AV estimating neural circuitry may be implemented between the lobula and descending neurons, and propose a model for the AV response in the bee as an extension of the optomotor pathway, allowing different detectors to be constructed by drawing selectively from a pool of elementary motion detectors with varying response timescales. The performance of the model is then validated in a simulated environment against data taken from experiments conducted in the field with real bees.
A cohort of 50 Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients from the Ivory Coast was followed up for 15 years, including 11 patients who refused treatment. Surprisingly, 10 out of 11 untreated patients showed parasite clearance using both microscopy and PCR. Seven of these 10 patients also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens. These findings suggest that two alternative natural progressions of HAT may occur: progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses and progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection associated with a progressive drop in antibody titers as observed in treated cases. This challenges the widely accepted belief that HAT is invariably fatal if left untreated. The existence of human trypanotolerance should be further investigated to better understand the outcomes of HAT infections and optimize control strategies.
The carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation, which includes gamma and X-rays, are strongly associated with cancer development in humans and mouse models. While predominant paradigms attribute the carcinogenic action of mutagenic carcinogens, including radiation, to the induction of genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, various investigators have proposed that carcinogenic treatments increase the selective advantages conferred by certain oncogenic mutations, thereby initiating tumorigenesis. Ionizing irradiation is a mutagenic carcinogen, and its exposure has been shown to cause cancer. P53 is a critically important tumor suppressor that mediates responses to a variety of cellular stresses, including genotoxic stress, and has well-characterized roles in mediating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. In the context of ionizing irradiation, p53 disruption confers a dramatic selective advantage, leading to long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and to increased lymphoma development in mice. Selection for cells with disrupted p53 appears to be attributable to several factors, including protection from acute irradiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and the disabling/elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors. In summary, ionizing irradiation can increase the selective advantages conferred by certain oncogenic mutations, thereby initiating tumorigenesis.
Schistosoma mansoni, a blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis, has the ability to modulate the human immune response, making it a focus of study for inflammatory disease therapies. The SmKI-1 protein, expressed in the parasite's intravascular stages, has been found to be a key factor in parasite survival, both in vitro and in vivo. When SmKI-1 expression is suppressed in the larval stage, parasites show impaired development and decreased viability. Suppression of SmKI-1 also results in a significant reduction in worm burden and egg count in infected mice. SmKI-1 has the ability to inhibit neutrophil function, reducing inflammation, and has been shown to interfere with neutrophil migration and elastase activity in murine models of inflammatory diseases such as acetaminophen-induced liver inflammation, gout arthritis, and carrageenan-induced pleural inflammation. The SmKI-1 Kunitz domain is responsible for elastase inhibition, and molecular docking studies suggest a complete blockage of NE active site by SmKI-1. The docking results also indicate good shape and chemical complementarities between SmKI-1 and neutrophil elastase. These findings suggest that SmKI-1 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic molecule for inflammatory diseases.
The article discusses a new method for accurately modeling large transmembrane helix (TMH) protein structures from distant homologs, which is important due to the difficulty in experimentally characterizing eukaryotic membrane protein structures. The method aims to improve the prediction of membrane protein structures, which is a major challenge due to the lack of close structural homologues. The method was tested on a benchmark of 50 TMH protein homolog pairs and improved most starting templates, achieving near-atomic accuracy prediction of membrane-embedded regions. The models generated by this method are of suitable quality for computer-based protein engineering, which can be useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues. Overall, this method provides a promising approach for the high-resolution prediction of membrane protein structures, which can have important implications for the design of more effective therapeutics and receptors with novel function for systems/synthetic biology applications.
Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne bacterial pathogen, can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised adults. During infection, L. monocytogenes proliferates in the host cytosol and exploits the host's actin polymerization machinery to spread from cell to cell. However, researchers have found that the bacteria can also enter a persistent state in a subset of epithelial cells. After several days of infection in human hepatocytes or trophoblast cells, L. monocytogenes switches from its active, motile lifestyle to a stage of persistence in vacuoles. These vacuoles, termed Listeria-Containing Vacuoles (LisCVs), allow a subset of bacteria to resist degradation and enter a slow/non-replicative state. This persistence strategy may allow the bacteria to evade the host's immune response and antibiotic therapy, contributing to the disease's long incubation period and potential for asymptomatic carriage. This knowledge of L. monocytogenes' ability to enter a persistent state in human cells provides important insights into the infection biology, immunity, and host cell biology of this pathogen.
The use of sequences of higher frequency A and lower frequency B tones in ABA-triplet patterns is a common method for studying auditory streaming. These sequences can be perceived as a single integrated stream or as two segregated streams, and this perception can switch irregularly over time. A neuromechanistic model was developed to study the persistent alternations in perception that occur during these stimulus presentations. This model, which combines neuronal units with sensory feature-dependent inputs, embodies a neuronal computation for percept competition that is thought to occur beyond the primary auditory cortex. The model predicts that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept. This prediction was confirmed through psychoacoustic experiments, and the behavioral data was used to further refine the model. The model provides a platform for studying other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition. Overall, this study provides a foundation for understanding the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying auditory streaming and perceptual alternations.
Schistosoma mansoni, a helminth parasite, induces a strong Th2-biased response in its hosts, characterized by elevated levels of total and parasite-specific IgE, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, with concomitant expansion and mobilization of specific effector cells. This IgE response is widely believed to have evolved to protect against ectoparasites and parasitic helminths, including Schistosoma. Human infection with S. mansoni correlates with a progressive increase of serum IgE levels. A complete medium- to high-throughput amenable workflow is described, which enables the rapid translation of S. mansoni proteins using wheat germ lysate and subsequent assessment of potential allergenicity with a humanised Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) reporter cell line. This method offers an accessible way for assessment of potential allergenicity of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates and is suitable for medium- to high-throughput studies using infected individual sera. This system is suitable for the study of the basis of allergenicity of helminthic proteins and can identify allergens at an early stage during vaccine development, which is crucial as vaccinating with an allergen bears the inherent risk of potentially inducing hazardous allergic reactions in sensitised individuals. A new detection system for antigen-specific IgE based on the NFAT-dependent luciferase expression in a humanised rat basophilic leukaemia cell line (RS-ATL8) was therefore developed, which can detect at least 1 fg/mL of egg white extract proteins as a luciferase expression, making it possible to study the potential allergenicity of a protein using only minute amounts of protein. This technology paves the way for high-throughput, genome-wide assessment of S. mansoni antigen allergenicity - the Schistosoma allergome.
In sexual reproduction, the mixing of two haploid genomes can result in advantageous variations for changing environmental conditions, but it also allows for the proliferation of selfish elements such as transposable elements (TEs). These TEs can lead to rapid divergence between populations and species, contributing to reproductive isolation. This is due to hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of hybrid sterility and germline damage that can occur when TE family abundance differs between parents. In the case of D. virilis, divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression and increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. Additionally, gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents that arise though polymorphic TE insertions. A study of D. virilis using intraspecific syndromes of hybrid dysgenesis found that this divergence in TE profile can play a significant role in determining TE activity across generations. Hybrid dysgenesis is defined as a syndrome of hybrid sterility and germline damage that occurs in intraspecific crosses when the male carries one or more TE families absent in the female. In Drosophila, the activation of TEs inherited solely through the Drosophila male germline can be explained by the fact that the maternal germline is the primary agent of transgenerational TE repression via PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) maternally loaded into the egg. In the absence of maternally provisioned piRNAs that target TE mRNAs for PIWI-mediated slicing, paternally inherited TEs become activated in the progeny germline. The P-M and I-R systems of hybrid dysgenesis in D. melanogaster and the syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis in D. virilis serve as models for understanding the consequences of accumulating differences in TE profile between populations. The D. virilis system, in particular, may be considered an intermediate state between the P-M and I-R models and crosses between entirely different species that differ significantly at the genic level. This syndrome serves as a useful model for understanding the consequences of accumulating differences in TE profile between populations and the effects on genome defense mechanisms.
Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene, resulting in increased FMR1 mRNA expression and reduced or normal FMR protein levels. The expanded CGG repeat is thought to induce toxicity as RNA. A study was conducted to understand the pathophysiology of FXTAS and to identify the cause of increased transcription in premutation carriers. The study found that overexpression of certain histone deacetylases (HDACs) suppresses CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. Increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus was found in patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, correlating with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repress FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extend lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila. These findings suggest that the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in cis, increasing expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA, and provide proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus.
The effectiveness of CD8 T cell responses is crucial for controlling chronic viral infections, and various factors of the host immune response contribute to the maintenance of effector CD8 T cells versus CD8 T cell exhaustion during such infections. Specific MHC alleles and the degree of MHC heterogeneity have been associated with enhanced CD8 T cell function and viral control during human chronic infection. However, the extent to which host genetics influence the establishment of chronic viral infection is unclear. A study examining the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic viral infection using an F1 cross of B10. D2 x B6 (D2B6F1) and BALB. B x BALB/c (BCF1) mice infected with the Clone-13 (Cl-13) strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) found that both H-2bxd D2B6F1 and BCF1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice. However, H-2bxd D2B6F1 mice on a C57BL genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection, indicating that mortality was CD8 T-cell-dependent. CD8 T cell depletion prevented mortality in Cl-13-infected D2B6F1 mice, and D2B6F1 mice maintained more CD8 T cell effector cytokine production and exhibited reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion marker PD-1. D2B6F1 mice also induced a larger Th1 response than BCF1 mice, and Cl-13-induced mortality in D2B6F1 mice was dependent on CD4 T-cell-mediated IFN-γ production. Therefore, increased functionality of the CD8 T cell response allowed for more rapid viral clearance at the cost of enhanced immunopathology dependent on both MHC diversity and the genetic background of the host.
Anthrax, a global re-emerging zoonotic disease, is endemic in rural regions of China, including northwestern areas such as Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia. A study analyzing human anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China from 1990 to 2016 used canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) to examine 106 Bacillus anthracis strains. Five sublineages/subgroups were detected, with all present in Xinjiang, two in Gansu, one in Shaanxi, three in Qinghai, and four in Inner Mongolia. The geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations showed different canSNP characteristics from those of strains isolated before 1990 in China, with the A. Br. Ames subgroup found scattered in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Gansu. The 106 strains were classified into 36 MLVA15 genotypes, with 21 first observed in this study, including MLVA15-28, MLVA15-30, MLVA15-31, MLVA15-38, MLVA15-CHN3, and MLVA15-CHN18. This study provides a preliminary survey of B. anthracis population diversity in China, helping promote anthrax prevention and control. Anthrax is primarily a herbivore disease, periodically causing human outbreaks with serious consequences. Enzootic in many countries, anthrax remains an endemic disease in China, particularly in northern and western provinces. Genetic population structure of B. anthracis is globally defined by canSNP and MLVA methods, revealing anthrax's wide distribution and potential use for bioterrorism. This study examines strains collected from 1990 to 2016 in northwestern China, analyzing their genetic relationships with canSNP and MLVA methods.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are food and waterborne pathogens that infect intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and cause severe diarrheal disease. These pathogens are protected from host inflammatory responses by colonizing the intestinal luminal surface. Host defense against these pathogens is thought to rely on immune-mediated changes in IEC, including goblet cells. A study using Citrobacter rodentium, a related mouse pathogen, found that hosts rely on immune-mediated changes in IEC, including an increase in IEC proliferation to replace infected IEC and altered production of the goblet cell-derived mucin Muc2. The study also found that Resistin-Like Molecule-β (RELM-β), a goblet cell mediator, is strongly induced during C. rodentium infection and is detected in the stool and serum. Infected Retnlb-/- mice (lacking the RELM-β gene) suffered increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to deep pathogen penetration of colonic crypts. The study suggests that RELM-β plays a critical role in recruiting CD4+ T cells to the colon to protect against C. rodentium infection, in part via the induction of increased IEC proliferation.
Noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that uses an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis. This mechanism relies on interactions between the VPg protein covalently attached to the 5´-end of the viral RNA and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the host cell. Specifically, VPg binds to the middle fragment of eIF4G (4GM; residues 652–1132), and a stretch of ~20 amino acids at the C terminus of MNV VPg mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. This binding motif is conserved in all known noroviruses. The functional significance of this interaction is shown by the ability of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VPg to inhibit in vitro translation of norovirus RNA but not cap- or IRES-dependent translation. These observations define important structural details of a functional interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G and reveal a binding interface that might be exploited as a target for antiviral therapy. Noroviruses are part of the Caliciviridae family of positive-sense, single-strand RNA viruses, which includes 5 genera that infect a variety of animals. Of these, noroviruses constitute the greatest threat to human health, causing around 18% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide and an estimated 200,000 deaths a year in children under 5 in developing nations. The murine noroviruses (MNV) of the GV genogroup only infect rodents and have been studied extensively as a convenient model for human norovirus infections.
"A simulation model called the ""selfish operon"" suggests that gene clusters in bacterial chromosomes can arise through horizontal gene transfer that is more likely to occur between genes that are physically closer to each other. This model, proposed by Lawrence and Roth, involves a population of individuals, each with a randomly assigned arrangement of genes on the chromosome. Horizontal gene transfer leads to the acquisition of new genes and their arrangement from a donor genome, with the probability of transfer decreasing with distance. The simulation is run for a certain number of time steps, and the genome length (minimum arc distance along the chromosome that contains all genes) is recorded. The simulation is implemented with a rearrangement probability of 10^-5 per genome per time step, a loss probability of 10^-3 per genome per time step, and a maximum probability of horizontal transfer of 0.01 per genome per time step. However, gene clusters do not evolve under the parameter values used by Lawrence and Roth. To produce clustering, the rearrangement probability must be low, the number of genes must be small, and the maximum transfer probability must be sufficiently high. Additionally, a Moran model with genome inversion was studied, which shows that genes in clusters are sometimes arranged in the order of biochemical reactions, and horizontally transferred sequences are not necessarily associated with operons. Overall, the evolution and maintenance of gene clusters in bacterial chromosomes remain an open area of research, with recent genomic studies casting doubt on the selfish operon hypothesis."
Malaria, caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite and its severe consequences, disproportionately affects pregnant women due to the specific adhesion of parasite-infected cells to the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by the VAR2CSA protein, a variant of PfEMP1, which binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta. The var2csa gene, responsible for encoding VAR2CSA, contains a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses its translation, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites. This repression is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation in the presence of the appropriate host tissue. Adults in malaria-endemic areas acquire partial immunity to malaria, but this immunity is lost during pregnancy, resulting in pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM). PAM is parity-dependent, with primigravid women most severely affected. VAR2CSA is specifically expressed in pregnant women, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism that does not apply to the rest of the var gene family. The uORF in the var2csa gene acts as a repressor of mRNA translation, potentially preventing its expression at times when no placenta is available for binding. This repression is likely due to a similar mechanism of translational repression, as re-initiation of expression of the second ORF is infrequent. The repression of var2csa expression is not due to an effect on mRNA transcription or stability, but rather at the level of protein translation. The uORF itself is translated, indicating that the peptide encoded by this ORF could play a role in repression of VAR2CSA expression. The majority of parasites actively transcribe var2csa, but only express the protein at very low levels on the infected erythrocyte (IE) surface, suggesting that post-transcriptional repression similar to that observed in reporter constructs may also regulate expression of the endogenous gene. Parasites can be selected to actively translate the protein, resulting in VAR2CSA surface expression and trafficking it to the infected cell surface, and predominant recognition by female-specific antibodies as well as binding to CSA.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection can lead to a range of disease outcomes, from asymptomatic infection to hemorrhagic fever and shock. The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection may be driven by host responses, reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells. A study was conducted to analyze the genome-wide microarray of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua, collected on days 3-6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. The results showed that the most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In DENV-infected patients, in vivo infection is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. The interferon response is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3-6 of illness. These findings highlight important differences between different manifestations of severity during DENV infection and identify some commonalities. Compilation of larger datasets in the future across multiple studies may lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach.
Herpesviruses are common pathogens that can cause various diseases and are difficult to clear from hosts once established. While herpesviruses have been extensively studied in vitro, how they infect new hosts and cross differentiated mucus-covered epithelia is unclear. A study on Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), a lymphotropic rhadinovirus related to the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus, was conducted to establish general principles of herpesvirus host entry. The study found that spontaneously acquired virions targeted the olfactory neuroepithelium, and the neuroepithelium displayed HS (heparan sulfate) on its apical neuronal cilia, which was bound strongly by incoming virions. The virions tracked down the neuronal cilia and either infected neurons or reached the underlying microvilli of the adjacent glial (sustentacular) cells and infected them. The olfactory neuroepithelium is therefore an important and complex site of HS-dependent herpesvirus uptake. Understanding how herpesviruses infect new hosts is important for developing effective control strategies, as host entry is a key target for disease control due to the difficulty of clearing latent herpesvirus infections. However, clinical presentations of herpesvirus infections have limited capacity to reveal how infection first occurs, as the routes used for entry and exit are not necessarily the same. Experimentally accessible viruses such as MuHV-4 are important sources of information for defining host entry functionally. MuHV-4 is a natural parasite of yellow-necked mice and is closely related to the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus. MuHV-4 persists in B cells and primarily infects terminally differentiated cells, likely through the primary target being a terminally differentiated cell, as the viral thymidine kinase and ribonucleotide reductase are required. The HS dependence of MuHV-4 is complicated, as it depends on its gp150, which binds HS only weakly. The main phenotype of gp150-deficient virions is not less binding to HS+ cells but more binding to HS-deficient cells. When gp150 is missing, such binding is constitutively available, and gp150 acts as an HS-sensitive switch that normally inhibits non-HS ligand binding. Many herpesviruses bind to HS, and the functions of MuHV-4 gp70 and gH/gL exist in KSHV. Most epithelial cell lines display accessible HS, but in vivo, HS and the main epithelial proteoglycan, Syndecan-1, are basolateral. Limited apical HS expression correlates with reduced in vitro epithelial infection by cytomegalovirus. The study found that an apical expression of poorly sulfated heparan appeared to be unique to the olfactory neuroepithelium and that apical HS was clearly associated with neuronal cilia rather than the underlying sustentacular cells. The neuroepithelium comprises neurons, sustentacular cells, and basal precursor cells. One day after virus inhalation, the lytic antigen-specific rabbit serum stained almost exclusively sustentacular cells, while two days later, lytic antigen expression was more extensive but retained the same predominantly sustentacular distribution. Gp150 disruption further rescues the infectivity of gL−gp70− knockouts, and gp150 acts as an HS-sensitive switch that normally inhibits non-HS ligand binding, for example, by gB. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of herpesvirus host entry and may inform the development of new antiviral strategies.
The Invasion of epithelial cells by Salmonella enterica requires the expression of genes located in the pathogenicity island I (SPI-1), which is tightly regulated and activated only under specific conditions. Most studies have focused on the regulatory pathways that induce SPI-1 expression, while this study describes a new regulatory circuit involving CRP-cAMP, a widely established metabolic regulator, in silencing of SPI-1 genes under non-permissive conditions. In CRP-cAMP-deficient strains, SPI-1 genes were strongly upregulated in the mid-logarithmic growth phase due to the post-transcriptional modulation of the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, HilD, by CRP-cAMP through a new regulatory motif within the hilD 3’UTR. The Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot 42, which is under the transcriptional repression of CRP-cAMP, targets the 3’UTR of the hilD transcript through its unstructured region III, exerting a positive effect on hilD expression. These results highlight the biological relevance of the hilD 3’UTR as a hub for post-transcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression.
The expansion of CAG/CTG repeats is responsible for many diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy 1. These repeats are unstable in selective somatic tissues, which accelerates disease progression. A study was conducted to investigate the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus using R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. The study found that instability rates were increased in R6/2 tissues as compared to R6/1 matched-samples. High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with the increased CAG instability of R6/2 mice. The levels of transgene expression and specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, but the levels of elongating RNA Pol II and H3K36 trimethylation at the HD locus were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. The study suggests that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability.
A study analyzed the genomic features of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) in an immunocompromised host with disseminated disease, comparing five full-length genomes sequenced from different sites of infection. Three nucleotide changes were found within a five-day period, including a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 within the BC loop (L97R), a conservative amino acid substitution in protein 2B (A38V), and a silent mutation in protein 3D (L175). In vitro cell tropism and competition assays revealed that the VP1 L97R substitution within the BC loop conferred a replicative advantage in SH-SY5Y cells of neuroblastoma origin, associated with altered interactions with host cell receptors. These findings suggest that the VP1 BC loop region of EV71 plays a critical role in cell tropism, contributing to neurotropism and dissemination in the immunocompromised patient.
Natural transformation, or competence, is a bacterial ability for the uptake of extracellular DNA that is central to bacterial evolution and allows for the rapid acquisition of new traits, such as antibiotic resistance in pathogenic microorganisms. In Streptococcus, a Gram-positive bacteria genus, genes required for competence are under the regulation of quorum sensing (QS) mediated by peptide pheromones, including the ComRS system. ComRS consists of a peptide (ComS) that is processed, secreted, and later imported into the cytoplasm, where it binds and activates the transcription factor ComR. ComR then engages in a positive feedback loop for the expression of ComS and the alternative sigma-factor SigX. Although ComRS are present in the majority of Streptococcus species, the sequence of both ComS/XIP and ComR diverge significantly, suggesting a mechanism for species-specific communication. To study possible cross-talk between streptococcal species in the regulation of competence, researchers developed a ‘test-bed’ assay to measure the activity of different ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides in vivo, revealing distinct ComR classes of strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. A crystal structure of ComR from S. suis was solved to further understand the interaction with XIP and to search for structural features that may explain XIP recognition. The structure revealed a variable and a conserved face in ComR proteins, where residues of the conserved face contribute to ligand binding and the variable face discriminate among XIP peptides. Together, these results provide a model for XIP recognition and specificity and allow for the prediction of novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity.
The research presented here focuses on the inheritance and DNA replication of centromeres in eukaryotic cells, using the yeast Candida albicans as a model organism. Centromeres are crucial for proper chromosome separation and inheritance, and their positioning is maintained across generations through epigenetic mechanisms. While some centromeres are defined by specific DNA sequences, others, like those in C. albicans, are not. Instead, C. albicans centromeres are associated with unique histone H3 variants, CENP-A/CenH3, and display distinct replication timing.The researchers found that centromeres in C. albicans are associated with the first firing replication origin on each chromosome, distinguishing them from non-centromeric origins that fire later in S-phase. This unique replication timing is linked to the asymmetrical nucleotide composition of centromeric DNA, which remains stable over evolutionary time scales. Comparative analyses of centromeric DNA sequences across strains and related species suggest that the identified replication origin sequence pattern is a hallmark of evolutionarily conserved and consistently active replication origins.These findings highlight the link between centromere positioning and replication origins and provide insights into the epigenetic inheritance of centromere position. The research further underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between DNA replication and centromere inheritance, particularly in higher eukaryotes, where centromeres have regional distributions and different primary sequences at each chromosome.
Back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with chronic back pain (CBP) being a significant contributor. Despite its prevalence, the biology underlying this symptom is not well understood. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of CBP was conducted, involving adults of European ancestry from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank. The study found a genome-wide significant association for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5, which was replicated in an independent sample. Two other loci, rs7833174 (between CCDC26 and GSDMC) and rs4384683 (in DCC), reached genome-wide significance in a joint meta-analysis. These findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of CBP and highlight potential targets for further investigation.
Taenia solium cysticercosis is an important but neglected zoonotic disease in many developing countries, including Cameroon, where it is underreported and under-recognized due to a lack of reliable data on the disease burden. A study in West Cameroon estimated the impact of T. solium cysticercosis using cost and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) estimations. The study found that the number of people with neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy was estimated at 50,326, representing 1.0% of the local population, while the number of pigs diagnosed with cysticercosis was estimated at 15,961, which corresponds to 5.6% of the local pig population. The total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon were estimated at 10,255,202 Euro, of which 4.7% were due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The monetary burden per case of cysticercosis amounts to 194 Euro. The average number of DALYs lost was 9.0 per thousand persons per year. This study provides an estimation of the costs due to T. solium cysticercosis using country-specific parameters and including the human as well as the animal burden of the zoonotic disease. The study highlights the need for more studies in cysticercosis-endemic countries to estimate the global disease burden of cysticercosis.
Staphylococcus aureus has a high number of RNAs with unknown functions, including several non-coding RNAs carrying a C-rich sequence that likely regulates mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. One such RNA, RsaA, represses the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator MgrA by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine and Dalgarno sequence, resulting in enhanced biofilm production and decreased capsule formation. This regulation leads to decreased protection of S. aureus against opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection in mice. RsaA is part of a regulatory network that contributes to the complex interactions of S. aureus with the host immune system and has likely been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions. Overall, RsaA is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections.
A novel strategy to visualize HIV-1 uncoating was developed using a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of a capsid-binding host protein, cyclophilin A (CypA-DsRed), which is specifically packaged into virions. Single virus imaging revealed that CypA-DsRed remains associated with cores after permeabilization and that CypA-DsRed and CA are lost concomitantly from the cores in vitro and in living cells. The rate of loss is modulated by the core stability and is accelerated upon the initiation of reverse transcription. The majority of single cores lose CypA-DsRed shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Single particle tracking at late times post-infection reveals a gradual loss of CypA-DsRed which is dependent on reverse transcription. Uncoating occurs both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. This novel imaging assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 uncoating in living cells and reveals the previously unappreciated spatio-temporal features of this incompletely understood process.
In this study, the properties of prokaryotic DNA, including archaeal and bacterial genomes, were examined through the usage of oligonucleotides, or short DNA sequences, and their frequencies. These frequencies were linked to various properties such as codon usage, DNA base-stacking energy, and DNA structural conformation. The study aimed to assess the statistical information potential of different DNA 'word-sizes' and how they differ in coding and non-coding regions. It was found that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, indicating that information in prokaryotic genomes is predominantly encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. GC-rich genomes were more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes. These differences may be attributed to the lifestyle of the organisms, as tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria. Overall, prokaryotic DNA can be considered as a long chain of overlapping oligonucleotides, and frequencies of differently sized oligonucleotides can reveal different properties and patterns of bacterial and archaeal genomes.
Meiotic recombination is crucial for the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity. It occurs through large-scale reciprocal crossovers and localized gene conversion events, also known as noncrossovers. While progress has been made in understanding factors influencing the initiation of recombination at human hotspots, little is known about factors acting downstream. A study analyzed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm DNA at six active hotspots and looked for disparity in the transmission of allelic variants indicative of any cis-acting influences. The study identified a novel form of biased transmission exclusive to the noncrossover class of recombinants at two hotspots, which presumably arises through differences between crossovers and noncrossovers in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair. This form of biased gene conversion is not predicted to influence hotspot activity but does constitute a powerful and previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive that may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome. Intriguingly, at both of the hotspots described, this drive favors strong (G/C) over weak (A/T) base pairs, as predicted from the well-established correlations between high GC content and recombination activity in mammalian genomes.
A high confidence human protein-protein association network was built upon the integration of chemical toxicology and systems biology, revealing uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, and predicting which compounds may be risk factors for human health. This computational systems chemical biology model can also identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals and proteins. The network has been used to identify protein targets for various chemicals such as di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pirinixic acid, and permethrine. The chemical-protein associations are supported through recent published studies. Humans are exposed to diverse hazardous chemicals daily, and the potential effect of these environmental compounds on human health is a major concern. The network can be used to predict both high level associations (linking chemical exposures to diseases) and more detailed associations (linking chemicals to proteins). The network performed well compared to other protein-protein interaction networks and revealed both known as well as many novel surprising connections between chemicals and diseases or proteins.
Cortical sensory neurons, including those in the primary auditory cortex, are commonly characterized by their receptive fields, which describe the linear relationship between a stimulus and a neuron's response. However, receptive fields do not capture the complex network dynamics in which neurons are embedded. By fitting a nonlinear feedforward network model (a network receptive field) to cortical responses to natural sounds, it was found that primary auditory cortical neurons have a much larger sensitive spectrotemporal domain than indicated by their standard receptive fields. The network receptive field, a simplified network consisting of 1-7 sub-receptive fields, consistently better predicts neural responses to auditory stimuli than the standard receptive fields. The network receptive field reveals separate excitatory and inhibitory sub-fields with different nonlinear properties, and the interaction of the sub-fields gives rise to important operations such as gain control and conjunctive feature detection. These conjunctive effects, where neurons respond only if several specific features are present together, enable increased selectivity for particular complex spectrotemporal structures and may constitute an important stage in sound recognition. Therefore, fitting auditory cortical neural responses with feedforward network models expands on simple linear receptive field models, revealing key nonlinear aspects of cortical processing while remaining easy to interpret in a physiological context. This modeling approach provides new insights into the neural computations underlying perception.
Intracellular circadian clocks, composed of clock genes acting in transcription-translation feedback loops, drive global rhythmic expression of the mammalian transcriptome, allowing an organism to anticipate the momentum of the day. A novel clock-perturbing peptide was used to establish the critical role of casein kinase (CK)-2-mediated circadian BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation (BMAL1-P) in regulating central and peripheral core clocks. Subsequent analysis revealed that CRY, as a repressor for protein kinase, mediates periodic binding of CK2β to BMAL1, inhibiting BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation by CK2α. FAD binding domain of CRY1, two C-terminal BMAL1 domains, and particularly BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT1, are critical for CRY-mediated BMAL1–CK2β binding. This forms a dual negative-feedback model in which a CRY-dependent CK2-driven posttranslational BMAL1–P-BMAL1 loop is an integral part of the core clock oscillator. Mammalian circadian systems orchestrate various metabolic, physiological, and behavioral rhythms through intracellular clockworks present in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and virtually all other cells and tissues. The core oscillator consists of transcription factors operating in transcriptional-translational feedback loops, driving rhythmic expression of approximately 10% of the mammalian transcriptome. The BMAL1–CLOCK heterodimer is the primary genome-wide driver for clock genes and clock-controlled output genes via E-box containing promoters. CRY-PER complexes, facilitated by CLOCK-mediated BMAL1 acetylation, repress the expression of E-box clock-controlled genes, accounting for the negative limb of the circadian feedback loop.
"Bile, a fluid consisting of bile salts, cholesterol, proteins, and electrolytes, is produced by the liver and aids in fat digestion, vitamin absorption, cholesterol elimination, and waste product removal. Its primary bile salts, derived from cholesterol, have antibacterial properties, disrupting membranes, denaturing proteins, and damaging DNA. Salmonella enterica, an antibacterial-resistant pathogen, survives in the bile-laden gallbladder using various strategies, including lumen escape, biofilm formation on gallstones, and planktonic cell survival in the gallbladder. While inhibition of bacterial growth by bile salts often involves bacterial death, Salmonella can adapt to grow at higher bile salt concentrations through previous growth in sublethal concentrations. This adaptation, observed in the laboratory, may be relevant during Salmonella colonization of the hepatobiliary tract. Genetic and biochemical analysis in E. coli and S. enterica has identified cell functions and mechanisms involved in bile resistance, with mutations that cause bile sensitivity often resulting in virulence attenuation in the mouse model of S. enterica infection. Bile resistance factors in Salmonella and other enteric species include envelope barriers, outer and cytoplasmic membranes, efflux pump systems, genes of multiple antibiotic resistence (mar) and PhoPQ regulons, and DNA repair functions. Wild type Salmonella bile resistance can be increased by growth in sublethal concentrations of bile, a phenomenon called ""adaptation,"" which may be relevant during Salmonella colonization of the hepatobiliary tract. Batch Salmonella cultures contain cells that show high levels of bile resistance without previous adaptation, a phenomenon called ""preadaptation,"" involving mutation in specific loci or activation of bile resistance responses in a subpopulation of bacterial cells."
The E. coli chromosome is compacted into 400-500 supercoiled domains by both active and passive mechanisms, including transcription and DNA-protein association. Prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain, bounded by the proximal location of Mu termini L and R, and dependent on a strong gyrase site, the Mu L end, MuB protein, and E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis and HU. This Mu domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations tested and is proposed to confer transposition readiness to Mu by fostering topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. Bacterial chromatin is spatially organized and condensed ~1000 fold to fit inside a bacterial cell. The E. coli chromatin is organized in a series of negatively supercoiled loops, segregated by dynamic domain barriers and compacted by several nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) including HU, IHF, Fis and H-NS. Supercoiling plays a vital role in compacting the chromosome, and a proper degree of supercoiling is crucial for all DNA-related processes. Transposable phage Mu is a temperate phage that integrates into essentially random locations on the E. coli chromosome. Transposition from mini-Mu plasmids in vitro requires DNA supercoiling for formation of a high-order transpososome within which the two Mu ends are interwound and synapsed. Supercoiling is inferred to be similarly important in vivo where Mu end pairing during replicative transposition additionally requires a centrally located gyrase binding site SGS. This site is the strongest such site studied and is found only in Mu-like prophages. Highly processive supercoiling by gyrase bound at the SGS has been proposed to propagate a supercoiled loop, with SGS at the apex, assisting transposase-mediated synapsis of Mu ends at the base.
This study investigates the use of Primaquine (PQ) to prevent Plasmodium vivax (Pv) relapses and clear mature gametocytes of P. falciparum (Pf), reducing post-treatment transmission. Children in Papua New Guinea received radical cure with Chloroquine, Artemether-Lumefantrine, and either PQ or placebo. Blood samples were collected over 8 months and analyzed for gametocyte carriage. PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79% of Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Mixed-species infections had reduced odds for gametocyte carriage compared to single-species infections. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment, likely caused by a relapsing hypnozoite, were equally likely to carry gametocytes than first infections after PQ treatment, likely caused by an infective mosquito bite. Pv relapses and new infections are associated with similar levels of gametocytaemia, highlighting the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02143934.
The Rho family of GTPases, including RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, control actin organization during various cellular responses such as migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. Although these GTPases have different downstream effects on actin remodeling, they all target the plasma membrane and are activated by GTP binding. The details of GTPase cycling between the membrane and cytosol are crucial to the upstream regulation of these biochemical switches. A modeling framework has been developed to analyze experimental data for these systems, revealing details of GDI-mediated cycling and helping distinguish between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms. This analysis can also be used to assess how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios. The activity of RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 is controlled by spatial localization, nucleotide binding, and binding to Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI). The spatial localization of these GTPases is important for activation by membrane-bound guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), which promote GTPase release of GDP and binding to GTP; the GTP state activates and/or recruits effectors at the membrane, producing the downstream actin-mediated cellular response. The GTPase activating proteins (GAP) bind to the active GTPases and promote conversion of the nucleotide GTP into GDP, inactivating the GTPase. Binding to GDI promotes relocation of the GTPases from the membrane to the cytosol, inhibits interaction with effectors and inhibits exchange between GDP and GTP bound states. The interactions between GDIs and GTPases can be regulated, modulating the cycling for spatial and temporal localization. The delivery and removal of GTPases from the membrane may also be independent of GDI.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs are used to collect data for assessing the impact of current interventions on achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem. Prevalence and intensity of infection data are typically collected from school-aged children (SAC), but adults are also likely to be infected. A mathematical model was used to investigate the impact of the age distribution of infection on the recommended coverage levels of preventive chemotherapy (PCT) required to achieve WHO goals. The model found that for moderate prevalence regions, treating SAC only may achieve the WHO goals, but for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is required. Therefore, the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region requires consideration of the burden of infection in adults, and accurate and detailed data are required from M&E programs. The importance of collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, including adults, at baseline and throughout the treatment program is highlighted. Additional epidemiological data such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment should also be collected in M&E programs.
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is a common neurological disorder characterized by disruptive seizures, with many drug-resistant cases considered for resective surgery. A study using a computational model of epilepsy applied to patient-specific structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 individuals with left TLE and 39 healthy controls aimed to predict surgical outcomes. The model validated patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset time and location, and performed in silico surgical resections. Results showed that patients tended to transit from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls. Seizure starting points were frequently in left hemisphere temporal and subcortical regions, with additional involvement of contralateral and frontal locations. The model predicted that patient-specific surgery may lead to better outcomes than current clinical procedures. This study provides a step towards patient-specific computational modeling of epilepsy surgery to inform treatment strategies.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is associated with several diseases including Kaposi's sarcoma and certain lymphomas. The virus encodes several genes with oncogenic potential, including vIRF-1, which has the ability to bind and inhibit various pro-apoptotic proteins. Viral chemokines, such as vCCL-1 and vCCL-2, have been shown to induce signal transduction leading to the repression of Bim, a pro-apoptotic protein, thereby promoting virus replication. Immunofluorescence analysis of Bim expression in HHV-8 lytically infected endothelial cells revealed that Bim was largely sequestered in the nuclei, rather than the cytoplasm, in cells supporting lytic reactivation. Further investigation showed that vIRF-1, specifically, induced nuclear translocation of Bim, leading to its inactivation. This vIRF-1-mediated Bim nuclear translocation plays a crucial role in the pro-replication and anti-apoptotic activity of vIRF-1. Disrupting vIRF-1 interaction with Bim specifically has been shown to inhibit Bim-induced cell death and inhibit virus replication. These findings suggest that vIRF-1 and vIRF-1:Bim interaction are effective mediators of apoptotic inhibition during lytic replication and are important for establishing conditions conducive to efficient virus production. Further research into the specific inhibition of vIRF-1:Bim interaction may provide a means to inhibit virus replication specifically and for therapeutic benefit.
The αVβ6 integrin, which is predominantly expressed in lung epithelial cells, plays a crucial role in maintaining lung homeostasis and modulating acute lung injury (ALI) through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. During influenza infection, the upregulation of β6 is involved in disease pathogenesis. Mice lacking the β6 subunit (β6 KO) have increased survival during influenza infection due to limited viral spread into the alveolar spaces, resulting in reduced ALI. This is attributed to the activation of lung interferon response caused by the absence of β6, which gives the host an advantage in controlling viral spread. The protective phenotype of β6 KO mice is reversed by the administration of exogenous TGF-β or elimination of the type I interferon receptor, indicating that αVβ6 controls a communication system between lung epithelia and immune cells through a TGF-β-dependent mechanism. The β6 integrin also plays a critical role during other respiratory infections such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. Transient inhibition of αVβ6 represents a potential therapy for the management of acute lung injury.
Leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, is a significant public health issue in the Americas, with cutaneous and mucosal forms. The Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) is a supportive diagnostic tool based on delayed type hypersensitivity responses to Leishmania antigens. A retrospective analysis of 733 individuals evaluated for their first episode of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Argentina (2006-2015) was conducted to assess LST's usefulness in diagnosis. LST showed a high correlation with smear results (Kappa index agreement 0.76, p <0.001) and comparable sensitivity across age groups. Lesions older than 21 days-old correlated with positive results for both smear and LST. The study supports the clinical use of LST as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis across all age groups, especially in endemic areas, with further research needed for standardization and adequate utilization protocols. Leishmaniasis, caused by L. (V.) braziliensis, affects millions of people in high-burden countries, with cutaneous and mucosal forms. LST, based on delayed type hypersensitivity responses, is a supportive diagnostic tool. A retrospective analysis of 733 individuals in Argentina (2006-2015) found a high correlation between LST and smear results (Kappa index agreement of 0.76, p <0.001) and comparable sensitivity across age groups. Lesions older than 21 days-old correlated with positive results for both smear and LST. The study supports LST's clinical use as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in endemic areas, with further research needed for standardization and adequate utilization protocols.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 loci associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), but the causal mechanisms behind most of these loci are unknown. Recent studies suggest that many causal GWAS variants affect disease risk through altered transcriptional regulation in disease-relevant cell types. In this study, the authors investigated changes in transcriptional regulation during a key pathophysiological event in CAD, the environmental lipid-induced transformation of macrophages to lipid-laden foam cells. They used a combination of open chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq) and enhancer and transcription factor mapping using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) in primary human macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), with resultant foam cell formation. OxLDL-induced foam cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and active enhancer sites that strongly correlated with expression changes of nearby genes. OxLDL-regulated enhancers were enriched for several transcription factors including C/EBP-beta, which has no previously documented role in foam cell formation. Variants at CAD-associated loci, including rs72664324 in an oxLDL-induced enhancer at the PPAP2B locus, were significantly enriched in the subset of chromatin sites altered by oxLDL exposure. These results demonstrate a genetic mechanism contributing to CAD risk at the PPAP2B locus and highlight the value of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic environmental stimuli.
In an effort to eliminate trachoma as a public health issue, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the implementation of the SAFE strategy in districts where the prevalence of the active trachoma sign trachomatous inflammation--follicular (TF) in 1-9-year-olds is 10% or greater. This strategy includes the implementation of the A (antibiotics), F (facial cleanliness), and E (environmental improvement) components. However, many endemic countries have a large number of districts with TF prevalences between 5-9%, and it is not practical to conduct sub-district level surveys in these areas due to resource constraints. A study was conducted in 8 Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalences of 5-9% to determine the impact of administering one round of azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) to the entire district, achieving mean coverage of ~80%. The results showed that each of the 18 evaluation units had a TF1-9 prevalence of less than 5%. This suggests that one round of azithromycin MDA with ~80% coverage can reduce TF prevalence to less than 5% in Malawi districts with TF of 5-9%. Further evidence is needed to support this approach in other areas.
Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein complexes in plants and humans sense infections and trigger robust immune responses, including programmed cell death (PCD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and transcriptional reprogramming. Six Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) have been identified as mediating bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1. The dynamics of differential CPK1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death, while sustained CPK4/5/6/11 activation directly phosphorylates a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors for transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth. CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases for ROS production. Functional genomic screens and biochemical genetic studies have revealed the specific and redundant roles of CPKs in NLR signaling events, including CPK4/5/6/11 in orchestrating immune gene expression, CPK1/2/4/11 in ROS production, and CPK1/2/5/6/ in PCD. Different CPKs are engaged in diverse immune responses via phosphorylation and activation of different substrates in distinct subcellular compartments. A functional genomic screen identified a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors that act synergistically with CPKs in primary NLR signaling. Sustained activation of CPK4/5/6/11 phosphorylates WRKY8/28/48 for transcriptional reprogramming of immune genes, whereas CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate NADPH oxidases for ROS production and contribute to PCD. Overall, this study reveals bifurcate NLR signaling mechanisms through specific, overlapping, and prolonged actions of CPKs in concert with distinct substrates in multiple subcellular compartments.
Schistosoma sp., a type of parasitic infection, impacts over 500 million individuals in 77 countries, with a higher prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. Its incidence has risen due to factors like increased irrigation projects, shifts from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, and ineffective control programs. However, less than 0.5% of Schistosoma sp. studies have attempted to predict spatial and temporal distributions, essential for public health programs in developing countries. This article discusses a study conducted in the Niono district of Mali, utilizing general-purpose exponential smoothing methods for S. haematobium time-series forecasts. These methods, within a state-space framework, accommodate seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations, providing reasonable accuracy for forecasts. This could aid in managing and assessing S. haematobium transmission and intervention impact in the district and potentially in other Sahel regions.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has a complex relationship with the cell cycle of its host cells. The viral tegument protein pp150 restrains the onset of viral gene expression in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, preventing infection in those phases when cyclin A-CDK is active. This allows the virus to synchronize its replication with the cell cycle, restricting it to the G0/G1 phase where cyclin A-CDK is inactive. The early viral gene product pUL21a maintains the status of low cyclin A2-CDK activity by targeting cyclin A for proteasomal degradation. This synchronization strategy is important for the productive replication cycle of HCMV, and without it, the virus may enter mitosis too early, leading to chromosomal damage and cell death. HCMV's synchronization strategy is similar to that of human papillomavirus (HPV), where two RXL motif-containing cyclin A interactors, E1 and E1@E4, regulate the start of viral replication and prevent the onset of mitosis. Both HCMV and HPV have evolved similar strategies to best synchronize their life cycle with the host cell cycle, providing stable conditions for virus growth and arresting the cell cycle in interphase.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, causing progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, while the remaining 90% are sporadic. Although genetic studies in familial ALS have been informative, the cause of ALS in approximately 30% of familial cases and in the majority of sporadic cases remains unknown. A recent study aimed to identify novel variants linked to ALS by performing targeted sequencing of 169 known and candidate ALS disease genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 matched controls. The study found a significant enrichment in novel and rare variants in cases versus controls, indicating that they are likely identifying disease-associated mutations. This study highlights the utility of next generation sequencing techniques and rare variant analysis tools to provide insight into the genetic etiology of a heterogeneous sporadic disease. Additionally, the study of sporadic ALS cases, which represent an underutilized resource for genetic information about ALS, can provide valuable information about the genetic architecture of ALS. Further research is needed to fully understand the genetic basis of ALS and to develop effective treatments for this debilitating disease.
The role of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cell-mediated immunity, specifically in the development of T cell memory to respiratory viruses, is not yet fully understood. However, recent studies have shown that IL-6 is an important regulator of T cell proliferation and survival, and is abundant during infection with influenza virus. Researchers analyzed virus-specific T cell activity in both wild type and IL-6 deficient mice and found that CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell memory is critically dependent upon IL-6. This effect of IL-6 includes its ability to suppress CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg), thereby facilitating the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells. These studies reveal a critical role for IL-6 in ensuring, within the timeframe of an acute infection with a cytopathic virus, that antigen-specific Tregs have no opportunity to down-modulate the immune response, thereby favoring pathogen clearance and survival of the host. Further studies into the generation of anti-viral immunity are needed, especially in the face of emerging new strains of influenza virus. A consideration of how cytokines modulate cellular immune responses will facilitate a better understanding of the interplay between such pathogens and the immune system and provide a rationale for enhancing vaccine efficacy.
Dnmt2 of the Dnmt2 family functions as a DNA and tRNA methyltransferase, but knowledge about its protein interactions is limited, making it difficult to understand its role and biological significance. A study has identified enolase as a Dnmt2-binding protein through a yeast two-hybrid screen. Enolase, which catalyzes the conversion of 2-PG to PEP, has both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. The study found that enolase acts as a Dnmt2 inhibitor, and this inhibitory activity is antagonized by 2-PG, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls the non-glycolytic function of enolase. Glucose starvation drives enolase to accumulate within the nucleus, leading to the formation of additional enolase-E. histolytica DNMT2 homolog (Ehmeth) complex and a significant reduction of the tRNAAsp methylation in the parasite. The crucial role of enolase as a Dnmt2 inhibitor was demonstrated in E. histolytica expressing a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-fused-enolase. These results establish enolase as the first Dnmt2 interacting protein and highlight an unexpected role of a glycolytic enzyme in the modulation of Dnmt2 activity.
Mosquito-borne pathogens, such as Chikungunya virus, are transmitted to humans through the saliva of mosquitoes during blood feeding. A new study finds that mosquito saliva contains exogenous microRNAs (miRNAs), which are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. This is the first time exogenous miRNAs have been identified in hematophagous arthropod saliva. The researchers discovered 103 miRNAs in mosquito saliva, 31 of which had not been previously identified. Several of these miRNAs were expressed only in Chikungunya-infected mosquitoes, and five of them were tested for their potential to regulate Chikungunya infection, demonstrating their functional role in the transmission and establishment of infection during blood feeding on the host. Mosquitoes are significant public health concern due to their ability to transmit a variety of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses. The presence of mosquito saliva can have a profound effect on the transmission efficiency, pathogen establishment, and disease development. The study of miRNAs in mosquitoes has shown that they play a role in blood digestion, egg development, immune gene regulation, and altered expression in mosquitoes infected with parasites. However, miRNA profiles in mosquito saliva have not been investigated previously. This study aimed to detect and identify miRNAs in the saliva of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes via deep sequencing, and found a total of 103 mature miRNAs, 31 of which were potential novel miRNAs. Fifty-nine and 30 known miRNAs were upregulated in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus CHIKV-infected saliva, respectively, indicating the possible functional importance of these miRNAs in CHIKV dissemination and transmission in the host.
Mitochondria contain an independently maintained genome that encodes several proteins required for cellular respiration. Deletions in the mitochondrial genome have been identified, which cause several maternally inherited diseases and are associated with certain cancers and neurological disorders. These deletions may result from recombination events, and the maintenance and repair of mtDNA are not well understood compared to nuclear DNA. Nuclear DNA repair proteins, such as Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p, localize to mitochondria and contribute to mtDNA repair. A study investigating the contribution of these proteins in mtDNA repair found that both Rad51p and Rad59p are localized to the matrix of the mitochondria and bind directly to mitochondrial DNA. Loss of these three proteins decreases the rate of spontaneous deletion events and impairs the repair of induced mtDNA DSBs. Overall, understanding the mechanisms of mitochondrial mutagenesis and repair is crucial as stability of the mitochondrial genome is required for the survival of most eukaryotic cells and mutations in the mitochondrial genome cause metabolic defects that underlie multiple diseases.
This systematic review aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health and Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), as well as evaluate the impact of interventions targeting these determinants. The study included 90 articles, representing 91 individual studies, of which 50.5% were poor in quality. A total of 57.1% and 50% of studies reported positive associations between socioeconomic factors and risk of GAS infection and ARF/RHD, respectively. Crowding and socioeconomic status were significantly associated with GAS infection and ARF/RHD, while other determinants such as income, dwelling characteristics, education, employment, and nutrition showed mixed results. Overall, the literature examining the role of social determinants in GAS infection, ARF, and RHD lacked quality, and more interventional studies are needed to establish a clear association and inform preventive strategies.
The PhoQ/PhoP system, a well-studied bacterial signaling network with an architecture found in many two-component systems, controls transcription of a large set of genes in response to various environmental conditions. A single point mutation in the histidine kinase PhoQ results in a striking change in the properties of the circuit. This mutation, which produces a T281R substitution in PhoQ, results in bistability with mutants persisting in morphologically distinct OFF and ON states for many generations. The bistable phenotype comes at a fitness cost, as the mutant has a lower fitness in stationary phase cultures in rich medium compared to the off state. The wild-type PhoQ/PhoP system responds to external stimulus in a graded manner, while the mutant exhibits bimodal distribution of phenotypes and phenotypic hysteresis. The mutation also results in a surge in transcription upon activation and gives rise to a broad distribution of PhoP-regulated transcription in a population of E. coli cells. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that PhoQ (T281R) is a poorer kinase compared to PhoQ (WT), and growth-mediated dilution is the dominant mechanism for reduction in concentrations of the stable proteins PhoP, PhoQ and PhoP-P in the absence of a specific phosphatase. The PhoQ/PhoP network can exhibit bistability at low kinase rates, resulting from positive feedback (transcriptional autoregulation) and the presence of two non-linearities. The bistability results from the low kinase activity and the absence of phosphatase activity of the PhoQ (T281R) mutant. Slow growth histories or high [Mg2+] are sufficient for en masse conversion of OFF cells to ON, a deterministic conversion from OFF to ON state termed “priming”. The bistable system can be considered irreversible, meaning that a population of ON cells cannot be deterministically turned OFF. However, individual ON cells can still transition to the OFF state in the bistable regime because of stochastic fluctuations.
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare and devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri, with a high mortality rate and no established success in treatment. The absence of economic incentives for the pharmaceutical industry to develop anti-PAM drugs has led to a reliance on drug repurposing as a cost-effective strategy. A potential target for drug repurposing is the sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) enzyme, which is essential for the survival of N. fowleri and shares similarities with fungal orthologues. This similarity raises the possibility of repurposing anti-mycotic drugs and optimizing their usage for the treatment of PAM. A recent study has investigated the impact of anti-fungal azole drugs on sterol biosynthesis and viability of cultured N. fowleri trophozoites, identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate, and analyzed the interactions between the recombinant CYP51 target and conazoles by UV-vis spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. The results validate CYP51 as a potentially 'druggable' target in N. fowleri and conazole drugs as candidates for assessment in the animal model of PAM.
The study of parasitic nematodes, which infect nearly 2 billion people and cause diseases ranging from anemia to cognitive deficits, is crucial in understanding the mechanisms behind protective immunity. Nematode parasites trigger a type 2 immune response via IL-4Rα, but the role of IL-4Rα in maintaining this response is unclear. A recent study used a strain of mice with tamoxifen-inducible IL-4Rα gene deletion to show that sustained IL-4Rα expression is required for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following interruption after polarization with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis primary infection. Additionally, temporal deletion of IL-4Rα prior to secondary infection enhanced recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of parasites. This novel function for IL-4Rα is distinct from its role in immune polarization, and has implications for the development of anti-nematode vaccines and understanding the maintenance of type 2 immune responses.
Bartonella bacteria, known to cause various human infections and found in numerous mammals, likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as the primary reservoirs for most Bartonella genotypes affecting humans. Human movements and actions impact wildlife disease, with over 60% of emerging infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans. Bartonella bacteria are an exception in tracing zoonotic potential and potential impacts on native hosts due to their high prevalence in various animals. The study constructed global phylogenies of Bartonella from both 16s rRNA genes and citrate synthase (gltA) to determine the evolutionary history, patterns of host switching, geographic constraint, and spillover into humans or from human commensals into wild species. Research was conducted under appropriate permits and approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. Sequences were downloaded from Genbank, and metadata were confirmed by examining the cited publications. Sequences were aligned, refined, and reduced for redundancy. Bayesian phylogenies were constructed for the 540 bp fragment and the 277 bp fragment, testing two models for the phylogenetic hypothesis based on the 540 bp fragment. The study found that Bartonella most likely originated in the environment and guts of insects, infecting mammals approximately 79 million years ago. Twice, Bartonella has infected mammals from these environmental samples, which are basal to the main clade of mammal-associated Bartonella. Bartonella are generally highly host-specific, but the study observed a number of host shifts in the large phylogenetic hypothesis. Of 19 spillovers into humans, seven were from rodent clades, two from bats, one from rabbits, one from roe deer, and four from cats and dogs. Four genotypes were of uncertain origin, including B. bacilliformis, B. ancashensis, B. quintana, and B. tamiae.
The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is upregulated in cancer tissues and is involved in hyper-proliferation, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. MALAT1 levels are regulated during the normal cell cycle and modulate the expression of cell cycle genes, required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Its depletion leads to activation of p5
Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key hormone that regulates insect development, metamorphosis, and reproduction. Methoprene-tolerant (Met), a JH receptor, has been shown to mediate JH action during metamorphosis and vitellogenesis. However, the molecular basis for JH's role in promoting adult reproduction has not been fully elucidated. In a recent study, researchers found that JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in the fat body of migratory locusts to facilitate vitellogenesis. This is achieved through the JH-receptor complex acting on Mcm4 and Mcm7, two genes in the DNA replication pathway. Knockdown of Mcm4 or Mcm7 inhibited de novo DNA synthesis and polyploidization, resulting in reduced vitellogenin mRNA levels and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Met directly regulates the transcription of Mcm4 and Mcm7 by binding to upstream consensus sequences with E-box or E-box-like motifs. These findings provide insight into JH-dependent polyploidy and vitellogenesis.
"The ""Treatment of Early Neuropathy in Leprosy"" (TENLEP) trial was designed to determine how prednisolone treatment best prevents permanent nerve function impairment (NFI) in leprosy patients. This study focused on a clinical trial where patients were randomized to receive either a 20-week or 32-week prednisolone course to test if a longer treatment duration would be more effective in restoring and improving recent clinical neuropathy (<6 months onset). The trial involved leprosy patients between 15 and 60 years of age with any recent peripheral NFI. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with restored or improved nerve function as measured by MFT and/or VMT at 78 weeks.The trial included 868 patients, of whom 432 were randomized to the 20-week arm and 439 to the 32-week arm. However, seven patients were excluded from the final analyses due to missing baseline MFT assessments or not meeting the inclusion criteria. The intake and distribution of patient characteristics per research center were similar between the two groups, with sensory function being more often impaired than motor function at baseline.The trial treatment period was completed by 65.5% of the patients in the 20-week arm and 66.7% of those in the 32-week arm. Complete follow-up data until week 78 were collected for 82% of the patients in the 20-week arm and 75% of those in the 32-week arm. The last observation carried forward method was used to handle missing data of patients lost to follow-up.The proportion of patients with restored or improved nerve function at week 78 was almost similar in both groups: 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in the 32-week arm (p = 0.821). There were no significant differences between the two groups in secondary outcomes such as individual nerves, impairment counts, RSS, SALSA-scale and P-scale scores between baseline and week 78, SAEs, and the proportion of patients needing additional prednisolone. However, there was a significantly higher proportion of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in the longer treatment arm (p = 0.04).In conclusion, a 20-week course of prednisolone is as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. Therefore, 20 weeks is the preferred initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy."
The Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) and the European Red Deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) use distinct types of sound communication during the mating season, with the elk producing loud, high-frequency bugles and the red deer producing loud, low-frequency roars. These sounds are the result of the interaction between anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics of the larynx and vocal tract. A finite element model of the larynx and a wave propagation model of the vocal tract have been used to understand the physiology of this system. The models show that low-frequency sounds, like those of the red deer, are related to overall body size, while high-frequency sounds, like those of the elk, may signal muscular strength and endurance. The elk's high-frequency bugle is achieved through large muscular effort and high lung pressure, resulting in a more intense sound. Glottal efficiency is higher in elk, indicating an advantage of high-pitched signaling. The dichotomy between low-frequency and high-frequency calls is not always related to body size, as larger male mammals can use high-pitched vocalization for display. The production of high-frequency calls, such as those of the elk, requires a large and stiff ligament, which can be operated at its mechanical limits and requires significant muscular effort to maintain.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful technique for large scale profiling of transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications, and is replacing ChIP-chip as the preferred approach for mapping transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin modifications. The state of the art for analyzing ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a relevant reference genome. However, this can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. A study describes a general approach for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome by allocating multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. This approach leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with uni-reads and improves detection of peaks in mappable regions. Peaks from multi-read analysis have similar characteristics to peaks that are identified by uni-reads except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. Overall, this study establishes that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has set targets for the control or elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by 2020, as reinforced by the 2
The widely accepted notion in neuroscience is that neurons with higher selectivity carry more information about external sensory inputs. However, a study on the auditory cortex found that high-selectivity neurons respond to a narrow range of sensory inputs, but the neural population conveys similar information about sound input across two temporal response epochs, with the amount of information encoded being almost completely dependent on the total number of population spikes in the read-out window. Contrary to the prevailing theory, the sustained response epoch, which has more selective neurons, conveys similar information about sound input as the onset response epoch. This suggests a novel principle of sensory encoding potentially shared widely among multiple sensory systems. The study highlights the importance of understanding the collective behavior of neural populations instead of focusing on individual neurons for a comprehensive understanding of sensory information processing in the brain.
In persistent viral infections like the one caused by the clone 13 (cl13) isolate of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), T cell responses need to be maintained over a longer period of time to control viral replication and avoid viral spreading. While inhibitory signals limiting T cell activity during chronic viral infection have been well-studied, less is known about the stimulatory signals that allow maintenance of anti-viral T cells. The co-stimulatory molecule OX40 is critical for controlling LCMV cl13 infection. Anti-viral T cells express high levels of OX40 in the presence of their cognate antigen and T cells lacking the OX40 receptor fail to accumulate sufficiently. The emergence of T cell dependent germinal center responses and LCMV-specific antibodies are also impaired in the absence of OX40. OX40-deficient mice fail to control LCMV clone 13 infection over time, highlighting the importance of this signaling pathway during persistent viral infection. OX40 signaling has the ability to promote long-term survival of T cells, and its importance might be more prominent in the context of viral persistence. In persistent LCMV cl13 infection, OX40 shapes both the CD4 and CD8 T cell response, and OX40-deficient mice are incapable of controlling viral replication.
"Convergent evolution, or the development of similar traits in species that do not share a recent common ancestor, is powerful evidence for the ""robust repeatability thesis"" in evolution. This theory suggests that the evolution of animals can be explained by the comparative selective advantage of evolutionary survivors over their inferior counterparts. In contrast, the ""radical contingency thesis"" argues that early patterns of animal evolution were generated by a selection process unrelated to the comparative fitnesses of the selected lineages.One example of convergent evolution can be observed in the swimming patterns of a diverse group of aquatic animals, including invertebrates and vertebrates from three different phyla. These animals swim by undulating elongated fins while keeping their body relatively rigid, a method that has evolved independently at least eight times. This swimming pattern, known as median/paired fin swimming, is characterized by an optimal specific wavelength (OSW) of approximately twenty times the mean amplitude (ã) of movement. This OSW maximizes the force generated by the body, resulting in a more efficient swimming motion.The OSW has been observed in a wide range of species, from small invertebrates to large fish, and is independent of the size of the fin. It is also insensitive to changes in key kinematic variables such as frequency and amplitude, as well as to changes in fin geometry such as height and shape. This suggests that once an elongated fin species has arisen, it may be costly to depart from the OSW. However, the majority of swimmers are not elongated fin species, and it is unclear why slower forms of swimming exhibited by median/paired fin animals would emerge and thrive despite the prevalence of body/caudal fin swimming in ancestral species.One possible explanation is that median/paired fin swimming is a low speed, low cost of transport specialization. The lower amplitudes of fin movement possible in median/paired fin swimmers, compared to the high power axial musculature used in body/caudal fin swimmers, result in a lower energetic cost of transport. This makes median/paired fin swimming an advantage in certain ecological contexts, despite the prevalence of body/caudal fin swimming in ancestral species.In summary, convergent evolution in the form of the OSW in median/paired fin swimming is evidence for the robust repeatability of evolution. This OSW, which has evolved independently at least eight times, is an efficient swimming pattern that maximizes thrust and is insensitive to changes in key fin movement parameters. The emergence of this trait in elongated fin species is likely to provide a selective advantage in certain ecological contexts."
The development of the cerebral cortex requires strict control of cell proliferation and differentiation, with neural stem cells (NSCs) in the ventricular zone (VZ) undergoing symmetrical divisions to expand the cell population and asymmetrical divisions to generate neurons and intermediate progenitor cells. Chromosome assembly and segregation during mitosis in NSCs rely on condensin I and II, two different types of condensin complexes. A study using mouse models with conditional knockouts (cKO) of condensin I and II subunits found that both complexes are essential for NSC divisions and survival, with individual depletions leading to distinct mitotic defects. NSCs depleted of condensin II display hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating a critical role for condensin II in establishing interphase nuclear architecture. These defects are carried over to postmitotic neurons. The study provides insight into the intricate balancing acts of the two condensin complexes during cortical development.
Schistosoma mansoni, a pathogenic parasite to humans, is a member of Schistosomatidae family which consists of over 20,000 hermaphroditic trematode species that have evolved gonochorism. Sex determination in schistosomes occurs through a female heterogametic system, but phenotypic sexual dimorphism is not apparent until after infection of the vertebrate definitive host, and gonad maturation occurs even later, after pairing. The molecular mechanisms that trigger sexual differentiation in these species are unknown, and in vivo studies on developing schistosomulum stages are lacking. To study the molecular basis of sex determination and sexual differentiation in schistosomes, a RNA-seq was performed on males and females for five developmental stages: cercariae larvae, three in vivo schistosomulum stages and adults. The results showed that 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between sexes in at least one of the developmental stages, and 4,065 were functionally annotated. Transcriptome data were complemented with H3K27me3 histone modification analysis using ChIP-Seq before and after the appearance of phenotypic sexual dimorphism. The study identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-biased players of the interaction with the vertebrate host, and different dynamic of the H3K27me3 histone mark between sexes as an illustration of sex-biased epigenetic landscapes. This research provides a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie sex determination and differentiation in S. mansoni, and it highlights the importance of studying the interplay between genetic and epigenetic regulation during sexual development in this parasitic species. As S. mansoni is pathogenic for humans, this study represents a promising source of therapeutic targets, providing not only data on the parasite development in interaction with its vertebrate host but also new insights on its reproductive function.
A study presents a method to model disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts by providing each annotation with a confidence value, the posterior probability that it is correct. This approach allows computing certainty-levels for individual annotations based on annotator-specific parameters estimated from data. Two probabilistic models were developed, compared using computer simulation, and tested on a large data set generated by human annotators. The results showed that the approach significantly increased the probability of choosing the correct annotation even when all annotators disagreed. The study also introduced a corpus of 10,00
A DNA vaccine technology has been used to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, for potential use in humans against HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome), caused mainly by ANDV (Andes virus) and ANDV-like viruses in South America. This vaccine technology involves the use of geese, which produce IgY and IgYΔFc antibodies that lack the properties of mammalian Fc, making them less reactogenic in humans. Geese were vaccinated with an ANDV DNA vaccine, and all developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination, which were maintained for over a year. The goose-derived antibodies were found to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins and protected hamsters from lethal HPS. These findings demonstrate the potential of using the DNA vaccine/goose platform to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure.
Changes in genomic DNA methylation patterns are crucial in the development of human cancers. The Dnmt3a enzyme is necessary for the establishment of normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dnmt3a have been found in leukemias. A study using a K-ras–dependent mouse lung cancer model found that deletion of Dnmt3a promotes tumor progression, indicating that Dnmt3a might suppress tumor development by stabilizing DNA methylation patterns. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to characterize the methylomes of Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. The results showed that profound global methylation changes occur in K-ras–induced lung cancer, with Dnmt3a wild-type tumors characterized by large hypomethylated domains and Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showing a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further data analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors show moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. These results uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes and define the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer.
A study in songbirds has discovered a spatial and temporal organization of the premotor cortical microcircuit that supports sparse sequences of neural activity, which are important for generating various forms of learned behavior. The study utilized multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging to reveal that neural activity in premotor cortex is inhomogeneous in time and space, and that a mesoscopic dynamical pattern underlies the generation of the neural sequences controlling song. Specifically, basal-ganglia–projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of a local 30 Hz network rhythm, creating a mesoscopic length scale in the premotor cortical area HVC. This length scale is similar to those reported in calcium imaging of cortex in behaving rodents, primate motor control, and human speech, suggesting that these may be core properties of motor cortical microcircuits across species. The study also found that the spatial organization of cellular activity has been considered irrelevant in dynamical models of the HVC network, but experimental studies suggest that HVC activity is spatially organized. However, temporal correlations between inhibition and excitation have been ignored in the models, despite the fact that excitatory and inhibitory neurons are known to be interconnected in HVC. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering spatial and temporal correlations in models of HVC network and the need for further research in this area.
The genetic regulation of aging and lifespan has been studied through the use of model organisms such as C. elegans, where it has been shown that insulin/IGF-1/daf-2 signaling can more than double the lifespan of an animal. This regulation occurs during adulthood and involves the insulin-signaling pathway negatively regulating the forkhead (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16. This regulation of lifespan through an insulin-like signaling cascade is conserved in flies and mice. In C. elegans, germline proliferation negatively regulates lifespan through a DAF-16 and KRI-1 mediated signal, while the somatic gonad promotes lifespan extension. Caloric restriction (CR) has also been shown to extend lifespan across species, and in C. elegans the sir-2.1 and let-363 genes regulate lifespan via CR. CR can increase lifespan at any time in flies, while mutations in the mitochondrial electron transport system can increase lifespan in worms. However, mutations in the ubiquinone biosynthesis gene clk-1 do not further increase the longevity phenotype from CR. Genome-wide RNAi screens have identified potential regulators of lifespan in C. elegans, but these screens may not identify essential genes that cause lethality or developmental pleiotropies. A recent study identified 64 genes that, when inactivated postdevelopmentally by RNAi, increase adult lifespan. These genes are highly conserved from yeast to humans and are involved in pathways such as insulin-signaling, stress adaptation, metabolism, and reproduction. These findings suggest that essential genes that function in postreproductive longevity control should be under natural selection at prereproductive stages and provide a new set of genes for studying the mechanisms of lifespan regulation.
A study investigating appendage regeneration in zebrafish fins has identified a temperature-sensitive allele of the extracellular matrix component laminin beta 1a (lamb1a) that blocks fin regeneration. The lamb1a gene is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation and is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. This is necessary for the expression of morphogenetic factors shha and lef1, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf1r, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. By contrast, lamb1a function is dispensable for juvenile body growth, homeostatic adult tissue maintenance, repair of split fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts. These findings reveal transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells as a key, growth factor-guided step in formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis. Interestingly, mammals have a limited ability to regenerate complex structures like limbs, heart, or central nervous system tissue, while teleost fish and urodele amphibians can regenerate major appendages, spinal cord, retina, brain, kidney, and the heart. The study of appendage regeneration in zebrafish fins has identified three prominent phases: 1) wound healing; 2) blastema formation; and 3) regenerative outgrowth and patterning. The wound epithelium becomes multilayered and acquires a layer of cuboidal basal epithelial cells over the next hours to days, maturing into a structure commonly referred to as the wound or regeneration epidermis, which expresses markers of developmental signaling pathways, including many secreted factors. Previous studies have shown that fgf20a and igf2b ligand genes are induced within hours of fin amputation in mesenchymal cells, and perturbation of Fgf signaling via a mutation in the fgf20a ligand gene or of Igf signaling by receptor inhibition disrupts formation of the regeneration epidermis and subsequent bone regeneration. However, the mechanisms by which these pathways define the morphology and signaling activities of the regeneration epidermis have not been addressed. The current study used forward genetics to identify a critical role for laminin beta 1a (lamb1a), one of two paralogs encoding a Laminin beta 1 extracellular matrix component, in zebrafish fin regeneration. Laminin is a critical node between growth factor signals and formation of the regeneration epidermis in an amputated vertebrate appendage.
Linear mixed models (LMMs) have gained popularity for modeling population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies. This approach builds on earlier methods from animal breeding and human genetics literature, and assumes a genetic correlation between individuals. LMMs have been adapted for use with samples of unknown or uncertain relationship, with kinship coefficients estimated from genome-wide genotype data. Several software packages have been developed to implement LMMs, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, TASSEL, and GEMMA. A comparison of these implementations, using a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families, found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches and success in controlling the genome-wide error rate. The choice of LMM implementation should be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use, as power and type I error considerations do not provide a clear distinction between the different approaches. LMMs have been proposed as alternatives to principal component-based approaches for adjusting population substructure and have shown to perform well in comparison to competing approaches.
The development of new drugs for Chagas disease is a priority due to the limited effectiveness and toxicity of currently available medications that are only effective against the acute phase of the disease. A whole-cell-based assay for high throughput screening of compounds that inhibit infection of mammalian cells by Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes has been optimized and used to screen a 2000-compound chemical library. Three hits, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, were selected for their high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells. These three compounds have different mechanisms of action on intracellular proliferation of T. cruzi amastigotes. CX1 has strong trypanocidal activity, an essential characteristic for the development of drugs against the chronic stage of Chagas disease. NT1 has a trypanostatic effect, while PCH1 affects parasite division. These compounds also show high activity against intracellular T. cruzi from the Y strain and against the related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. Two additional compounds, PCH6 and CX2, were selected based on their chemical similarity to PCH1 and CX1, respectively. These compounds have IC50 values of 2 nM, which is approximately 100 times lower than those of the medicines used in patients against T. cruzi. These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
"A novel diagnostic approach for molecular xenomonitoring of filarial parasites in mosquitoes has been developed, utilizing a rapid, NaOH-based DNA extraction methodology combined with a portable, battery-powered PCR platform and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. This ""Backpack PCR"" methodology provides a cheaper and equipment-minimizing diagnostic option that can be transported to the field and implemented in minimal resource settings. It can be adapted to the detection of W. bancrofti and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The platform has been proven to be effective in detecting B. malayi DNA from extracted mosquito pools, providing sensitive and genus-specific detection, and eliminating reliance on expensive instrumentation without compromising sensitivity or specificity of detection. The field-ready system should increase the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring within B. malayi-endemic locations and provides a proof-of-concept for the development of a parallel assay for the detection of W. bancrofti."
Elastomeric proteins, such as elastin, resilin, abductin, spider dragline silks, and wheat gluten, are self-assembling proteins that provide extensibility and elastic recoil. They have evolved independently and are composed of alternating hydrophobic and cross-linking domains. The hydrophobic domains, which are rich in repetitive sequences, provide elasticity and drive the self-assembly process, while the cross-linking domains help stabilize the polymer. Studies on the impact of domain architecture on polymer assembly and integrity have shown that the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the resultant polymeric structure. For example, highly connected polymers were constructed from asymmetric rods consisting of relatively large cross-linking elements interspersed with smaller elastomeric domains. Understanding the relationships between the supramolecular organization of elastomeric proteins and their mechanical properties can guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides. Mesoscale methods, such as the modified Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) algorithm, can be used to simulate the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins and explore the impact of different configurations of elastomeric and cross-linking elements on the morphology and stability of the assembled polymer. These simulations provide insights into the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins and help guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides.
"Ebolaviruses, highly lethal zoonotic pathogens, have longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due to long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) in the seven viral transcriptional units. However, specific functions have not been assigned to these UTRs. A study using reporter assays showed that the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) 5′-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function but differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. The 5′-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppresses translation of GFP compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L 5′-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF (pORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 5′-UTR. The L uAUG is sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a ""weak"" Kozak sequence and suppresses pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2α is phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintains translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. Mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences in the L uAUG attenuated virus growth to titers 10-100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. These findings identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression, demonstrate their relevance to virus replication and identify a potential therapeutic target."
Genome instability plays a critical role in various biological processes and diseases, particularly cancer. A new method was developed for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes, revealing non-random fragmentation and DSB hot spots. These hot spots are scattered along chromosomes and delimit protected 50–250 kb DNA domains. About 30% of the domains, called forum domains, possess coordinately expressed genes and specifically bind PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 proteins at the forum domain termini. This novel type of gene regulation, coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters delimited by DSB hot spots, provides insights into chromosomal architecture and specific chromosomal regions at DSBs. Furthermore, the data suggest that unknown chromosomal regulatory mechanisms may be involved in replication, transcription, and DSB formation in various normal cell types and could be affected in cancer cells, leading to massive genomic rearrangements.
This study focused on the infection of Trypanosomatidae in bats in two areas of the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro state, Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu (REGUA) and Estação Fiocruz Mata Atlântica (EFMA), and assessed whether trypanosomatid diversity is influenced by bat diversity and the degree of preservation. The study found no influence of the level of preservation on bat species richness, with similar chiropterofauna and a higher abundance of two common fruit-eating bat species in the tropics. Of the 181 bat specimens analyzed, 13% were infected by trypanosomatids, with no significant difference between the two areas. Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite, followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV, and Trypanosoma sp. Mixed infections and a new host record for T. dionisii were also observed. The study confirmed that bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state harbor a great diversity of trypanosomatids and maintain trypanosomatid diversity in this sylvatic environment. The findings emphasize the importance of studying local biodiversity and the potential public health implications of these parasites.
Ixodes ricinus ticks, the most common vector of diseases to humans and animals in Europe, can transmit a wide range of bacteria, viruses, and parasites, with many ticks co-infected with multiple pathogens. A study of 267 I. ricinus female ticks from the French Ardennes found that 45% were infected with at least one pathogen, with the most prevalent being Lyme disease spirochetes (21.7%), Bartonella henselae (17.6%), and Rickettsia of the spotted fever group (16.8%). The high prevalence of these pathogens and the potential for co-transmission to humans or animals pose significant concerns for public and animal health. Additionally, tick symbionts, which can affect tick biology and potentially interact with pathogens, were also prevalent, with 100% of ticks carrying at least one microorganism and up to eight different microorganisms in a single tick. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering co-infections and symbionts in tick-borne disease research and prevention efforts.
Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are determined by genetic networks, including the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision governed by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. These genes are primed at low expression levels prior to lineage commitment, and their molecular circuitry is crucial to understanding not only hematopoiesis but also developmental systems in general. A computational model was developed to explain the mechanism of this genetic switch, which includes a cofactor regulated and recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner for bistability and switch-like behavior. This switch interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. This genetic switch example highlights the significance of regulating cooperativity through cofactor recruitment in lineage commitment studies.
Enterococcus faecalis, a commensal bacterium often found in the gastrointestinal tract and environment, can become opportunistic pathogens causing hospital-acquired infections. These infections can be difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. One factor contributing to E. faecalis pathogenesis is resistance to the host innate immune system, including high resistance to lysozyme. This resistance is mediated by a complex network of transcriptional regulators and genes such as oatA, pgdA, dltA, and sigV, which inhibit lysozyme's enzymatic and cationic antimicrobial peptide activities.To identify novel genes involved in E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme, transposon mutagenesis was performed in a quadruple mutant (oatA/pgdA/dltA/sigV) deficient in known lysozyme resistance genes. This led to the identification of a locus called the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA) variable region, which is responsible for EPA decorations. These decorations contribute to resistance towards charged antimicrobials and underpin virulence in the zebrafish model of infection by conferring resistance to phagocytosis. Specifically, EPA decoration reduces the negative charge of teichoic acids, inhibiting the cationic antimicrobial peptide activity of lysozyme, and affects peptidoglycan composition, impairing cell envelope integrity. Moreover, epa mutants display increased susceptibility to antimicrobials targeting the cell envelope, such as SDS, polymyxin B, nisin, and sodium cholate. Overall, these findings indicate that EPA decoration plays a crucial role in E. faecalis resistance to antimicrobials and virulence, revealing a new target for developing novel treatment strategies against E. faecalis infections.
The papers discussed aim to understand the transcriptional programs in complex organisms, focusing on human systems. Transcriptional regulation is carried out by transcription factors (TFs) and microRNA (miRNA), which can act as activators or repressors at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, respectively. With the advancement of high-throughput technologies, large-scale expression profiling of long and small RNAs, genome-wide interrogation of TF occupancy, and DNA methylation have become widely available through consortia such as ENCODE and TCGA. These data provide an opportunity to develop computational models that effectively integrate heterogeneous data from multiple platforms and reveal insights into transcriptional regulation.Previous studies have explored the topology of TF-miRNA coregulatory networks, integrated TF-binding signals with miRNA regulatory networks, and employed supervised machine-learning methods to predict mRNA expression using TF-binding data. However, these studies have limitations, such as not considering both TF and miRNA regulations simultaneously or not incorporating valuable non-binary TF binding data.To address these issues, the authors propose a two-stage regression framework, RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation), which integrates data from both TCGA and ENCODE. RACER first infers sample-specific TF activities using ENCODE TF binding data derived from a generic cell-line and then uses the estimated regulatory activities to infer miRNA/TF-gene regulatory relationships across samples. This approach has been applied to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) data, demonstrating superior statistical power in detecting known or confidence TF/miRNA-gene interactions compared to alternative models.The study identified 18 prominent (post-) transcriptional regulators, including 16 TFs and 2 miRNAs, whose inferred activities consistently cluster based on cytogenetic risk groups. Among these, the authors propose a novel role for a recently identified miRNA hsa-miR-548p in AML pathogenesis due to its significant target gene enrichments for leukemia-related pathways and its inferred interaction with another prominent feature regulator, YY1, whose perturbed expression has been implicated in AML development. Additionally, they identified a potential prognostic marker using the inferred TF activities of C-Fos, which has been previously shown to have oncogenic activity and is frequently overexpressed in tumour cells.In summary, the authors provide a novel framework that successfully integrates the TCGA and ENCODE data in revealing AML-specific regulatory programs at the global level, providing insights into the condition-specific transcription programs in complex organisms.
The fungal kingdom is vast and diverse, with RNA silencing pathways that function in genome protection and are involved in pathogenicity, development, and antiviral defense. Fungal viruses, or mycoviruses, are widespread and can have debilitating effects on their host, making them a potential tool for controlling fungal plant pathogens. In the ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum, knock-out mutants affecting genes for three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), two Dicer-like (DCL), and two Argonaute (AGO) proteins were generated to investigate the role of RNA silencing. The greatest effects on RNA populations were observed in the Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2, and Δago1 strains, where a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletotrichum higginsianum non-segmented dsRNA virus 1 (ChNRV1), was derepressed. Phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship between ChNRV1 and members of the segmented Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO1 showed abundant loading of 5’U-containing viral siRNA. Further analysis revealed that the conidiation and spore morphology defects in the Δdcl1 strain were primarily caused by ChNRV1. Therefore, RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum is proposed to function as an antiviral mechanism against ChNRV1.
In male meiosis, the phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX) occurs in three waves during meiotic prophase I, initiated by ATM at leptonema and ATR at zygonema and pachynema. MOF, a major HAT for histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16), is involved in all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation expansion. In the absence of MOF, MDC1 recruitment and MSCI are disturbed, and RAD51 foci persist in Mof cKO spermatocytes, indicating defects in DSB repair and the formation of crossovers. MOF is differentially expressed in mouse tissues with much higher expression in testes than other organs, and it is highly expressed in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. Male mice with germ cell-specific Mof deletion (Mof cKO) have very small testes, a significantly decreased ratio of testis to body weight, and a functional role in spermatogenesis. Testes from adult Mof cKO mice exhibited a marked decrease in the diameter of seminiferous tubules and the number of germ cells, with many tubules showing arrest at the primary spermatocyte stage, and a few tubules lacking meiotic cells. Immunofluorescence ( IF ) staining of testicular sections for VASA indicated massive germ cell loss in Mof cKO testes, and meiotic progression is disturbed with a significantly higher ratio of leptotene to zygotene spermatocytes and lower ratio of pachytene spermatocytes. The sperm count in epididymides of Mof cKO mice also dropped to about 10% of that in control animals, indicating that MOF plays an important role in the maintenance and development of germ cells at different stages, especially those in meiotic prophase I.
"The article discusses the role of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in the development of T-cell leukemia, specifically adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The study uses a ""Human Immune System"" (HIS) Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model, which is infected with HTLV-1. The results show that the virus integrates into the thymocytes of the mice, leading to alterations in human T-cell development and an increase in the number of mature single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ cells at the expense of immature and double-positive thymocytes. These alterations are correlated with the proviral load and are accompanied by the activation of human lymphocytes and the expression of NF-kB dependent genes, such as bfl-1, an anti-apoptotic gene. The study also notes the development of hepato-splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lymphoma/thymoma in the infected mice. The authors conclude that the HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- animal model is useful for studying the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1. The study also highlights the potential of the HTLV-1 Tax protein in perturbing T-cell development and contributing to malignant progression."
The study focuses on the outcomes of an integrated control program for schistosomiasis, a parasitic trematodiasis, in Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State, Sudan, from 2009 to 2011. The project's major target group was 78,615 primary school students. The program included mass chemotherapy, health education, and construction of a drinking water supply facility. The overall prevalence for S. haematobium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After the project, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced by more than 50% to 13.5% (95% CI=0.331-0.462). A higher reduction in prevalence was observed among girls, those with moderately infected status, and residents in rural areas. After health education, increased awareness about schistosomiasis was observed. A drinking water facility was constructed at Al Hidaib village, where the infection rate was reduced more compared to that in a neighboring village. However, there was no significant change in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection. The project resulted in approximately 200,000 subjects receiving either praziquantel therapy, health education, or clean water supply. To consolidate the achievements of this project, continuous implementation of the integrated intervention is required.
Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) pathogen. The matrix (M) protein of NiV, which mediates viral assembly and budding, was found to transit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane during live NiV infection. A bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in NiV-M were identified, and mutations in these signals impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and abolished NiV-M budding. A highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions in mediating nuclear import and as a potential site for monoubiquitination which regulates nuclear export of the protein. Proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, reduced viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, opening up the possibility of using an “off-the-shelf” therapeutic against acute NiV infection.
The infection process of viruses involves the transfer of their genetic material across a cellular membrane and into the appropriate cellular compartment. However, the mechanisms of this process, particularly for non-enveloped animal viruses, are not well understood due to technical difficulties and uncertainties in distinguishing productive and non-productive pathways. A study using poliovirus (PV) as a model system combined an imaging assay and an infectivity-based assay to characterize the early events in PV infection. The results showed that PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell through a clathrin-, caveolin-, flotillin-, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine kinase- and actin-dependent, endocytic mechanism. Genome release occurs immediately after internalization from vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations located within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane. This contradicts previous beliefs that PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. Mechanistic understandings of viral entry may lead to new therapies for combating viral infection and provide new insights into fundamental cellular functions.
Dengue fever is a significant public health issue in Cambodia, particularly for children, and is prevalent in the study province of Kampong Cham. The National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) focuses on distributing temephos and insecticide spraying, with health education delivered through various means, such as at health clinics, during village outreach activities, and in schools. However, adherence to preventive activities is partial, and the translation of knowledge to practice varies. School-based education can be an important complement to community education, as demonstrated in Puerto Rico and Thailand where primary school programs have increased children's knowledge of and participation in dengue prevention and control. However, a study in the Philippines showed that students had good knowledge but limited participation in source reduction activities. Health belief and behavioral change models have been used to develop educational materials, but little work has been done on the mode of delivery or effectiveness of routine programs. Factors such as adequate funds, technical and human capacity, cooperation between health centers and village networks, and strategies for overcoming adverse physical conditions are necessary for effective outreach. Political commitment and the availability of educational resources also impact outreach activities. Despite the challenges, health education has the potential to improve knowledge and practices related to dengue prevention and control in Cambodia.
Filarial nematodes cause significant and debilitating diseases in both humans and animals, with over 150 million people affected by filarial infections such as lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. Diagnosing these infections is challenging due to various developmental stages occupying different tissues in hosts. Currently available diagnostic tests have limitations, such as low sensitivity or specificity, and inability to predict adult worm burden or viability. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that play regulatory roles in gene expression and have been found in human fluids and mammalian cell culture medium. Circulating miRNAs are involved in intercellular communication and have potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in various conditions.Recent studies have investigated circulating miRNAs from nematode parasites, including filarial nematodes. In Dirofilaria immitis (canine heartworm)-infected dog plasma, over 200 candidate nematode miRNAs were identified using deep-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Of these, two miRNA candidates (miR-71 and miR-34) were found to distinguish infected samples from uninfected samples. Similarly, 21 candidate miRNAs were detected in Onchocerca volvulus-infected human serum. These parasite-derived circulating miRNAs offer a promising avenue for improving filarial diagnostics. However, the correlation between miRNA copy numbers and microfilaraemia is not straightforward due to potential imprecision in mf counts and the unknown number of adult worms present in host circulation. Further studies are needed to better understand the role and potential utility of these parasite-derived miRNAs in filarial diagnostics and therapeutics.
The Src-family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are large allosteric enzymes that play a crucial role in cellular signaling, regulating cell growth and proliferation. These kinases can switch between different inactive and active states in response to intracellular or extracellular signals. The Src kinase domain is composed of an N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a C-terminal lobe (C-lobe), with the active site located between the two lobes. The kinase's conformation changes upon activation, and the central activation-loop (A-loop) controls accessibility to the active site. In the inactive state, the A-loop is compact and blocks the active site, while in the active state, the A-loop changes conformation, allowing access to the active site. A coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain was constructed using experimental structures for the two stable states, and simulations were run to study the dynamics of conformational transitions in kinase activation. The model suggests that there exist two parallel pathways for the activation of Src kinase, one of which the conformational switching is coupled with local unfolding of the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. This simplified model is a first step toward understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of conformational activation of the catalytic domain.
F1 lethality in hybrid offspring from crosses between diverged parents is a target of speciation research, with F1 lethality observed in interploidy crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same genotype due to dosage-sensitive incompatibility, playing a role in polyploid speciation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a single large-effect QTL, DR. STRANGELOVE 1 (DSL1), and two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL1 affecting the rate of postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte were identified. DSL1 is located in an interval encoding the maternal effect transcription factor TTG2, with ttg2 loss-of-function mutations in maternal parents suppressing the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm is similarly affected by both natural variation and ttg2 loss-of-function mutants, indicating a rapid evolution of F1 lethality in polyploids. Postzygotic lethality of the hybrid offspring functions as a barrier driving or reinforcing speciation.
Bats and rodents are crucial reservoirs of numerous emerging infectious diseases, with research focusing predominantly on viral pathogens. However, bacterial zoonoses in these hosts remain understudied. This study comparatively examines the host-pathogen coevolution of Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp., two bacterial pathogens with significant impacts on public health, in bats and rodents. The study utilizes published genetic data to generate maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tests for coevolutionary congruence using ParaFit, PACO, and Jane. The results indicate that Bartonella spp. have coevolved significantly with both bat and rodent hosts, while Leptospira spp. in bats lack such congruence. The study also finds that Leptospira in bats has the greatest number of host switches per parasite, while Bartonella and rodent host associations have the fewest. These variable coevolutionary patterns are attributed to disease-specific transmission and host ecology. Understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts is essential for predicting spillover between mammal reservoirs and ultimately to humans.
Undulatory swimmers, like fish, move through the water using deformation kinematics caused by muscle contractions or fluid forces. A fundamental issue is whether complex muscle forcing is required to create these deformation kinematics. A study using a forced damped oscillation framework applied to a chain-link model for undulatory swimming shows that simple forcing patterns can trigger complex deformation kinematics leading to movement. Both active and passive swimming lead to deformation kinematics, which in turn cause translational motion. The frequency of muscle activation relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. These results are confirmed by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Prior research on the optimal value of stiffness for maximum speed is explained. Overall, the study shows that relatively simple forcing patterns can trigger complex deformation kinematics leading to movement in undulatory swimmers.
Genetic recombination between pathogens derived from humans and livestock can result in novel pathogen strains, as demonstrated by the influenza pandemic H1N1/09, which was a result of a reassortment of swine, avian, and human influenza A viruses. In this study, researchers investigated the potential for genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals to generate new strains of the human pathogen T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr), which is responsible for sleeping sickness in East Africa. The researchers found that the SRA gene, which confers human infectivity in Tbr, can be transferred into new genetic backgrounds by sexual reproduction between Tbr and Tbb, creating new strains of the human pathogen Tbr. This has implications for the epidemiology of HAT in East Africa, as new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the much larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes, posing a risk for future outbreaks of HAT. Microbial genetic recombination can lead to the creation of pathogen strains with novel phenotypes and can accelerate the spread of drug resistance. This highlights the importance of monitoring and understanding the genetic recombination of pathogens to prevent potential outbreaks and limit the spread of drug resistance.
Diabetes is caused by dysfunction of beta-cells in the islets of Langerhans, affecting insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling between beta-cells coordinates a pulsatile secretory response to elevated glucose and suppresses insulin secretion at basal glucose levels. A critical number of inexcitable cells can rapidly suppress overall islet response due to gap junction coupling. In Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), a monogenic form of diabetes, gap junction coupling exacerbates islet dysfunction caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the KATP channel. Reductions in gap junction coupling allow progressively greater glucose-stimulated calcium and insulin secretion following expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels. Stochastic noise plays a significant role in the recoveries predicted by a computational model of islet electrical activity. The islet functions as a multicellular system, with complex interactions between cellular elements determining overall system behavior. Understanding such systems is complicated by the action of cellular coupling, system architecture, and cellular heterogeneity. While the function of a multicellular system depends on the characteristics of its constituent cells, changes in the behavior of individual cells can often lead to unexpected changes in system behavior. Many diseases, including diabetes, arise through genetic variations that impact molecular and cellular function. Network theory can be used to distinguish network structure and cellular behavior to understand how distinct functions can emerge from coupled systems. The islets of Langerhans are small micro-organs consisting of primary cellular elements of insulin-secreting beta-cells. Death or dysfunction of beta-cells and a reduction or absence of insulin secretion is the main cause of diabetes. Beta-cells are excitable, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is driven by electrical activity. The islets of Langerhans exhibit complex multicellular behavior, with β-cells electrically coupled by Connexin36 (Cx36) gap junction channels. Gap junction coupling coordinates calcium oscillations under elevated glucose and suppresses insulin secretion under basal glucose. In NDM, mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes often result in reduced sensitivity to ATP and increased open channel stability, thereby limiting electrical activity and insulin secretion. Sulfonylurea therapy inhibits KATP channels, effectively treating many NDM patients with KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations. However, some NDM patients with specific KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations do not respond to sulfonylureas and require life-long insulin therapy.
"In this study, the authors address the challenge of predicting the dynamic behavior of a large network based on the behavior of its individual components, a problem commonly encountered in systems and synthetic biology. The ability to accurately predict the behavior of a network from its components is hindered by context-dependent behavior, caused in part by retroactivity. Retroactivity is a phenomenon similar to loading, influencing the dynamic performance of a module when connected to other modules. The authors present a framework for analyzing gene transcription networks that accounts for retroactivity. They introduce three retroactivity matrices that encode a module's key properties: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity. These matrices can be computed from macroscopic parameters such as dissociation constants and promoter concentrations and the modules' topology. These matrices allow for the prediction of how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. The authors provide a metric determining a module's robustness to interconnection with other modules, aiding in the design of synthetic systems and the evaluation of natural networks' modularity. This research contributes to the development of models that capture retroactivity's effects, enabling the accurate prediction of temporal dynamics in regulatory networks. The authors focus on a single module without inputs and describe how retroactivity among nodes affects its dynamics. A model approximating the isolated module dynamics is presented, and implications for negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, and the activator-repressor clock are discussed. The internal retroactivity of a module describes how retroactivity among nodes within a module affects its isolated module dynamics. The internal retroactivity, representing the rate of change of total (free and bound) TFs, describes how ""stiff"" the module is against changes in total TF concentrations due to loading applied by internal connections. The authors determine how the dynamics of a module change when it is inserted into its context, extending the model to account for external TFs as inputs. The external retroactivity of a module captures the phenomenon by which external TFs force internal TFs to bind/unbind, and the main result of this section describes how the context of a module affects the module's dynamics due to retroactivity. The authors introduce the scaling and mixing retroactivity, which describe the loading that the context applies on the module and the ""mixing"" of the dynamics of the module and that of its context, respectively. These matrices provide insight into the physical meaning of retroactivity, enabling the analysis of the effects of interconnection on a module's dynamics."
The pseudoautosomal region (PAR) is a short region of homology between the mammalian X and Y chromosomes that is crucial for proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in male meiosis. PAR1, the PAR in humans, has an exceptionally high male crossover rate, which is 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. This is necessary for achieving recombination in a short genomic segment, and PRDM9, a protein that localizes virtually all crossovers in the autosomes, is involved in this process. However, recent research in mice suggests that crossovers in PAR may be mediated independently of PRDM9. A study using African-American pedigrees constructed the most fine-scale genetic map containing directly observed crossovers to date and found that PRDM9 does localize peaks of recombination in the human PAR1. This region is a far more rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1 than it is on the autosomes, and PAR1 hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations. Additionally, PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots. These genetic maps will aid research on this vital and fascinating region of the genome.
During muscle differentiation, myoblasts stop proliferating and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes, accompanied by the activation of muscle-specific genes and repression of cell cycle-associated genes. The b-HLH family of myogenic transcription factors, such as MyoD, and MEF2 factors, play key roles in controlling muscle-specific gene expression. Histone post-translational modifications, including methylation, are critical in regulating the expression of genes associated with them. In muscle differentiation, H3K27 methylation inhibits muscle differentiation, while H3K27 demethylation participates in the activation of muscle-specific loci during differentiation. H3K9 methylation also plays a role in Myog repression, ensuring that cells do not differentiate prematurely.JMJD2A, a member of the Jumonji domain-containing demethylases that demethylates H3K9 and H3K36, has been suggested to act as both a co-activator and co-repressor. However, its role in muscle differentiation remains unclear. In this study, a new isoform of JMJD2A, lacking the N-terminal demethylase domain (ΔN-JMJD2A), was identified and found to be upregulated during myoblast differentiation into myotubes. ΔN-JMJD2A acts as a transcriptional co-activator for genes involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and binds directly to the Myog promoter, regulating H3K9 methylation and promoting Myog expression and myotube differentiation.Knockdown of both isoforms of JMJD2A impairs differentiation, myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression, and myogenin expression, while a siRNA against only the full-length isoform has no effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) shows that JMJD2A binds to the Myog promoter specifically in differentiating cells and that this binding correlates with demethylation of H3K9me2 and transcriptional activation of the gene. The Myog promoter is a direct target of the ΔN-JMJD2A isoform, and other potential target genes of ΔN-JMJD2A remain to be identified.In summary, the induction of the ΔN-JMJD2A isoform is crucial for muscle differentiation. By directing the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter, it promotes transcriptional activation of the Myog gene and thus contributes to initiation of muscle-specific gene expression, highlighting the importance of histone methylation and demethylation in muscle differentiation.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP), established in 1986 by WHO, The Carter Center (TCC), UNICEF, and CDC, has significantly reduced Guinea Worm Disease (GWD) from an estimated 3.5 million cases in 21 countries in 1986 to 25 cases in four countries in 2016. GWD, a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) caused by the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis, mostly affects impoverished communities in remote and marginalized areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the success, the global eradication of GWD still requires certification by WHO of the absence of transmission in all countries.This study examines the cost-effectiveness of GWEP during the end game when the number of cases is low, and the cost per case is higher than at any other time. The researchers estimate the total cost of GWEP implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages from 1986-2030 and compare it with two alternative scenarios: doing nothing (no intervention since 1986) and control (only surveillance and outbreak response during 2016-2030). The study reports the cost per case averted, cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted, and cost per at-risk life year averted.The study finds that GWEP cost an estimated US$ 11 (95% uncertainty interval, 4.70-12.49) per case averted in the period 1986-2030. The pre-certification and certification phases can cost as much as US$ 0.0041 and US$ 0.0015 per capita per year. The cost per DALY averted by the GWEP is estimated at US$ 222 (118--372) in 1986-2030. The GWEP is probably more cost-effective than control by the year 2030. The GWEP is certainly more cost-effective than control if willingness to pay for one year of life lived without the risk of GWD exceeds US$ 0.10.In conclusion, the study suggests that GWEP remains a cost-effective intervention in reducing GWD cases, even if the economic costs are two times as high as financial costs estimated for the period to 2020. However, whether the GWEP turns out to be the most cost-effective alternative in the period beyond 2015 depends on the time horizon. Nonetheless, from the perspective of the number of years of life lived without the risk of GWD, a case can be made more easily for finishing the end game, including certification of the absence of transmission.
The carboxy-terminal domain of the BBK32 protein from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, termed BBK32-C, binds and inhibits the initiating serine protease of the human classical complement pathway, C1r. This study investigated the function of BBK32 orthologues of the Lyme-associated Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, specifically BAD16 from B. afzelii strain PGau and BGD19 from B. garinii strain IP90. BAD16-C exhibits BBK32-C-like activities in all assays tested, while BGD19-C has reduced in vitro complement inhibitory activities relative to BBK32-C or BAD16-C. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that three residue positions in BBK32-C, targeted in the BXK32-C chimera, are surface-exposed and potentially relevant in C1r binding and inhibition. BBK32-C only recognized C1r fragments containing the serine protease domain. These structure-function studies improve understanding of how BBK32 recognizes and inhibits C1r and provide new insight into complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme-associated spirochetes of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. B. burgdorferi sensu lato are the leading arthropod-borne infectious agents in the Northern hemisphere and are capable of hematogenous dissemination. Complement evasion is crucial for their survival and persistence in immunocompetent hosts. Lyme-associated spirochetes have evolved mechanisms to evade complement detection and activation. For example, B. burgdorferi sensu lato species encode up to five distinct proteins that bind to and recruit factor H to the bacterial surface, thereby hijacking its complement protective activities. Additionally, distinct borrelial proteins specifically block the formation of the membrane attack complex, recruit host plasminogen and degrade complement components, or bind directly to other complement components. In total, nearly a dozen B. burgdorferi sensu lato proteins have been identified with specific complement inhibitory activities.
The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. While previous gene-knockout studies have identified many factors involved in this transformation, the regulation of these factors remains unclear. Investigating morphogenetic control by post-translational phosphorylation has revealed the Fkh2 transcription factor as a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1. Fkh2 has a diverse pool of phospho-isoforms in stationary phase yeast cells, and its phosphorylation profile is transformed for a short window during hyphal induction before reverting to the yeast profile. This transformation does not occur in fresh medium supporting yeast growth. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1, and substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile. The hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. Therefore, a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event has been discovered that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.
Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic trypanosomatid, has both de novo and salvage routes for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, making it independent of external pyrimidines for growth. However, recent research shows that thymidine kinase (TK), a salvage enzyme thought to be redundant, is essential for the parasite's growth and infectivity. Contrary to previous understanding, TK is required for thymine nucleotide synthesis from either de novo or salvage pathways. This reliance on TK in the absence of dCMP deaminase (DCTD) may be a shared vulnerability among trypanosomatids, presenting an opportunity for developing a single drug to target a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes. T. brucei causes Human African trypanosomiasis, a disease with high mortality and limited treatment options due to drug resistance and administration challenges. New drugs are badly needed, and understanding the unique features of the protozoan pyrimidine pathway could lead to innovative therapeutic approaches.
In prokaryotic gene expression, translation initiation typically involves the interaction between the ribosome and an mRNA sequence called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. However, many genes lack this sequence, and the mechanism of start codon recognition in these cases is unclear. Researchers conducted genome-wide searches in various prokaryotic groups and found that mRNAs without a Shine-Dalgarno sequence tend to have less structure in their translation initiation region and show a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Experiments using reporter gene constructs in bacteria support this finding. Additionally, AUG start codons are usually found in single-stranded regions, while internal AUG codons are typically in structured regions of the mRNA. These results suggest that the local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation, providing a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site.
In a study of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar, India, treated with liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) as first-line treatment, it was found that the development of post-Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) was infrequent and there were no predictive risk factors. Of the 8311 patients treated for VL, 0.3% returned with symptoms of PKDL, with a median time to development of 1.2 years following treatment. The time to developing PKDL was significantly shorter with Ambisome than in a subset of patients previously treated with sodium stibogluconate for VL. The study concludes that the risk of PKDL following treatment with Ambisome is low, but patients should be counseled about the possibility of developing symptoms within a shorter time frame compared to other treatments.
Chagas disease is a significant public health issue in South America, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by the insect Triatoma infestans. The main prevention method is controlling the insect vectors; however, these vectors have been re-emerging in certain areas. A study was conducted in northwest Argentina to understand the reinfestation dynamics of T. infestans after community-wide insecticide spraying. The study compared different methods of estimating the probabilities of bug establishment and found that more new bug populations become established from May to November than from November to May. The seasonal increase in bug establishment coincides with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new bug establishment increases with increasing time since last detected infestation. These results highlight important gaps in the current understanding of T. infestans ecology. Experiments are necessary to close these gaps and increase the efficiency of vector control. Additionally, a detailed knowledge of the spatio-temporal pattern of repeated insecticide application is necessary for developing an optimal spraying strategy. Analyzing field data that cover both the spatial range of T. infestans dispersal and the temporal range of T. infestans population recovery is crucial. This knowledge can help in effectively controlling the transmission of Chagas disease.
A study was conducted to understand the genesis of diseases caused by polyomaviruses in humans and to guide the development of viral diagnostics, therapeutics, and preventative measures. The study focused on Simian virus 40 (SV40), a polyomavirus able to infect humans and the only one with a small animal model amenable to mechanistic studies of early steps in viral pathogenesis. SV40 is known to establish persistent infections and induce tumors under certain conditions. The study used Syrian golden hamsters as the animal model and inoculated them with two wild-type strains of SV40 and mutants unable to produce SV40 miRNAs derived from each WT strain. The results showed that all four viruses were efficient at establishing persistent infections and SV40 had a broad tissue tropism, with infected tissues including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. Liver and kidney contained higher viral DNA loads than other tissues, and kidneys were the preferred site for long-term persistent infection. The study provided the first evidence of expression and function of SV40 microRNA in vivo and identified broad tissue tropism for SV40 in vivo in hamsters. Viral microRNA dampened viral DNA levels in tissues infected by SV40 strains with simple or complex regulatory regions. However, the absence of viral miRNA had no effect on replication of the virus in tissue culture. Wild-type and microRNA-negative mutants of SV40 showed similar rates of transformation of mouse cells in vitro and tumor induction in weanling hamsters in vivo.
A comprehensive examination of mammalian positively selected genes (PSGs) was conducted using six high-coverage genome assemblies of eutherian mammals, resulting in the identification of over 400 genes with significant evidence of positive selection. These PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, with several specific functions and pathways also enriched. A novel Bayesian analysis indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. PSGs were expressed at significantly lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs, with enrichment in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast but not in brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.
Staphylococcus aureus, a pathogen that colonizes mammalian skin and mucosal surfaces, forms biofilms that are difficult to eradicate due to their high resistance to host immune response and chemotherapy. A study discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure in S. aureus biofilms grown in rich media, which has amyloid-like properties and is composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). These fibers play a crucial role in biofilm integrity, as mutants unable to produce PSMs were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Soluble PSM peptides disperse biofilms, while polymerized peptides do not, suggesting that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity in biofilms.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects around six million people in more than 20 countries, mainly in Latin America. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is crucial to control the disease and evaluate treatments. Routine screening is achieved through serological assays, but PCR testing has limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in circulating blood. A new antibody profiling assay has been developed to assess parasite persistence based on waning antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection. A multiplex serology assay with fifteen optimized T. cruzi antigens was used to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. Specific antibody response (Ab3) showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by T. cruzi PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signal was associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while a significant decline in Ab3 signals was observed in BZN-treated patients who cleared parasitemia based on blood PCR results. Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients, likely induced and maintained by tissue-based and shed parasites. This simple immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients. Chagas disease, or American Trypanosomiasis, is a neglected illness by the World Health Organization that affects over six million people worldwide. It is caused by the protozoan parasite T. cruzi, transmitted by a Triatome vector with a large reservoir territory spanning from Argentina/Chile to the southern part of the United States. The disease may also be transmitted through blood transfusion, congenitally, or by oral route. Different clinical forms of Chagas disease exist, with patients in the acute phase being generally symptom-free or having mild, non-specific symptoms. Following this acute infection period, the infection generally progresses to chronic phases, with a small proportion of spontaneously resolved infections. The majority of chronic Chagas disease patients remain in the indeterminate form, defined as asymptomatic persistent infection that can last for decades. However, about 30% of patients eventually develop life-threatening cardiac and/or digestive symptoms requiring complex clinical management and specific treatments. Two drugs are currently available to treat acute or chronic Chagas infection, but their efficacy is difficult to evaluate, particularly during the chronic/indeterminate phase. The main criterion to establish treatment success is the reversion of the conventional serology from positive to negative status in association with negative results on parasitological tests. During the acute phase, both drugs have shown successful clinical, parasitological, and serological treatment outcomes. However, during the late chronic phase, the serological cure rate with BZN is estimated to be between 8% and 40%. The treatment efficacy for adult patients in the chronic phase is still controversial and difficult to estimate. Nonetheless, it is generally agreed that BZN-treatment contributes to decreasing the parasitic load, resulting in a decline in antibody titers and consequently is likely to improve clinical outcomes if applied early in the chronic phase of the infection. Several other factors also affect the drug success rate, including the genotype of the parasite, the age of the patients, the interval between infection and start of treatment, and the clinical stage of the disease when therapy is given. The treatment causes many side effects, including dermatitis, digestive manifestations, hypersensitivity reactions, and polyneuropathy. For these reasons, the risk-benefit ratio between adverse events and expected benefits is taken into account for patients with or at risk for cardiac and/or digestive complications. In the absence of specific clinical signs, several techniques have been proposed to evaluate the treatment efficacy of Chagas disease, including serological assays and detection of the parasite in blood by PCR. Among these techniques, PCR has shown promising results for assessment of anti-parasitic therapy failure but not therapy efficacy.
The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arthropod-transmitted virus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain, with a substantial fraction of patients experiencing chronic musculoskeletal pain for months to years after the initial infection. However, the mechanisms promoting chronic CHIKV disease are not well understood. While replicating virus has not been detected in joint-associated tissues of patients with persistent arthritis, viral RNA can be detected months after acute infection. A study using a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase (CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre) found that this virus replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts and induced arthritis during the acute phase in mice, as well as chronic disease with persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis similar to wild-type virus. Infection of tdTomato reporter mice with CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre resulted in a population of tdTomato+ cells that persisted for at least 112 days, predominantly as myofibers and dermal and muscle fibroblasts. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a host receptor for CHIKV, reduced the number of tdTomato+ cells in the chronic phase and diminished the levels of chronic viral RNA, implicating these tdTomato+ cells as the reservoir of chronic viral RNA. This CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system is a useful tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease. CHIKV is a globally re-emerging arthropod-transmitted virus that can cause chronic musculoskeletal pain in a substantial fraction of patients for months to years after the initial infection. A study using a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase (CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre) found that this virus replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts and induced arthritis during the acute phase in mice, as well as chronic disease with persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis similar to wild-type virus.

This CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system is a useful tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.
Recent studies have used dimensionality reduction methods to understand the relationship between the multi-dimensional structure of neural population activity and brain function. However, it is unclear how these results generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials or how they relate to the underlying network structure. This study applies factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. The study found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Additionally, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.
The studies discussed highlight the significant role of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signals, particularly the Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS-regulated molecule 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA), in mediating immunomodulation and host-pathogen interactions. 2-AA modulates host immune responses in a way that increases the host's ability to cope with this pathogen, as seen in mice treated with 2-AA prior to infection having a 90% survival rate compared to 10% in non-pretreated infected mice. 2-AA stimulation activates key innate immune response pathways but attenuates immune response activation upon pretreatment, most likely by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a transcriptionally regulated block of c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB activation.Bacterial quorum sensing plays a crucial role in host-pathogen interactions, with bacterial and host factors engaging in an antagonistic interplay that determines the outcome of the infection. Secreted microbial products, including many virulence factors, play a critical role in this interplay. QS regulates these products, which are crucial for infecting mammals, through a cell density-dependent communication system achieved through the production and regulation of low-molecular-weight, excreted signal molecules.In the case of P. aeruginosa, QS systems control the gene expression of many virulence factors through three QS systems: LasR, RhlR, and MvfR (PqsR). These systems regulate the production of various virulence factors critical for infecting mammals and modulate inflammation and immune responses in mammals. The 3-oxo-C12-HSL signal molecule, for instance, inhibits dendritic cell and T-cell activation, promotes apoptosis, and inhibits the ability of macrophages and monocytes to respond to a range of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists through disruption of NF-κB signaling.Overall, the studies emphasize the importance of QS in host-pathogen interactions and the complex role of QS-regulated excreted molecules in modulating host immune responses. Understanding these interactions can provide insights into developing novel therapeutic strategies for combating bacterial infections.
Mammalian genomes consist of numerous active and fossilized retroelements, and the obligatory integration of retroelements allows hosts to domesticate these elements for their own use, leading to significant genomic innovations. One such domesticated gene is L1TD1, which is derived nearly entirely from a LINE-1 (L1) retroelement and is widely known for its role in pluripotency maintenance in humans. However, the origin and evolution of L1TD1 reveal that it has undergone positive selection during primate and mouse evolution and has been repurposed for a potential role in genome defense. L1TD1 has been recurrently selected for functional novelty and has been lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution, suggesting its role in genome defense and pluripotency maintenance is not universal across all mammalian lineages. Retroelements, including L1TD1, have had a profound impact on mammalian genomes, shaping them over millions of years and occasionally driving dramatic episodes of adaptation through the generation of genetic novelty. While retroelement activity is rarely beneficial, individual transposition events can lead to significant adaptations. Furthermore, repetitive elements have often been co-opted as transcriptional regulatory elements, and protein-coding genes derived from retroelement- and retrovirus- sequences have been preserved for their beneficial activities in the host genome. For example, envelope genes from ancient retroviruses have been preserved for their membrane-fusing and immunosuppressive activities in the placenta, while other domesticated retroelement-derived genes have evolved for genome defense against L1 elements and have been incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. These examples highlight the critical role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology and the adaptability of these domesticated genes in different lineages.
YbeY is a highly conserved protein that plays key roles in both processing of the critical 3' end of 1
A study on the assortativity signatures of human transcription factor networks (TFNs) was conducted using DNaseI-seq data from 41 distinct cell and tissue types. The study revealed a common assortativity signature among the TFNs, which consists of greater-than-expected out-in and out-out assortativity, and expected in-out and in-in assortativity. Perturbation analyses of TFN models demonstrated a significant influence of the assortativity signature on the robustness of a TFN's gene expression phenotypes. The study found that out-out assortativity is the most important of the four components of the assortativity signature in driving this robustness in TFN models that approach the high edge density of human TFNs. This is consistent with earlier theoretical results that showed the relationship between this type of assortativity and robustness. Overall, the study suggests that degree assortativity provides an additional structural source of robustness in biological networks and that human TFNs share an assortativity signature that confers such robustness.
In a study conducted on anesthetized adult rats, the activity of up to 74 neurons was recorded in the somatosensory barrel cortex using large-scale multi-electrode arrays in response to whisker stimuli that varied in location and frequency. Neurons were classified as inhibitory (INH) or excitatory (EXC) based on their extracellular spike waveforms. The study found that individual INH neurons in granular and infra-granular layers were better at discriminating between restricted sets of stimuli compared to EXC neurons. Ensembles of INH cells provided as much information about the stimuli as comparable ensembles containing the most informative EXC neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests that a consortium of INH neurons dominates the information conveyed to the neocortical network, efficiently processing incoming sensory activity. These results add to the understanding of the role of the inhibitory system in orchestrating cortical activity. The study also found that L4 INH neurons, which are the major cortical target of the lemniscal pathway, presented high levels of evoked activity at low stimulation frequencies and had higher precision and lower adaptation at higher frequency stimulation compared to L4 EXC neurons. Overall, INH cells conveyed more information than EXC cells and were faster and more informative in discriminating stimulus location. These findings have implications for the understanding of the mechanisms employed by populations of cortical INH neurons in encoding sensory stimuli and in shaping structured network activity.
Synthetic biology aims to reprogram living cells to perform new functions for various applications, with initial work focusing on transcription factors but more recently shifting to regulatory RNAs due to their high programmability. However, functional circuits using only regulatory RNAs are limited. A new study reports the engineering of a fundamental arithmetic logic unit (ALU) based on de novo riboregulation to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations within a living cell. The system uses post-transcriptional control to switch on tightly silenced genes with small RNAs and allosteric transcription factors to sense molecular signals. This result demonstrates the potential of regulatory RNAs in synthetic biology and paves the way for engineering more complex RNA-based biocomputers using this designer circuit as a building block. This development is important as it brings us closer to the realization of smart cells that can make appropriate decisions after processing signals from the medium, with potential applications in diagnostic bacteria for clinical use.
Cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) is an enzyme that regulates the intracellular nucleotide pools within the cell by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. High level of cN-II expression is correlated with abnormal patient outcome when treated with cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. A study was conducted to identify the specific role of cN-II in the resistance phenomenon observed during cancer therapy by screening a class of chemical compounds, ribonucleoside phosphonates, as potential cN-II inhibitors. These compounds incorporate a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of a regular phosphoester bond. Six compounds were predicted as better ligands than the natural substrate of cN-II, inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP). The binding strength of these compounds was explained by an impressive number of van der Waals contacts, highlighting the decisive role of three cN-II residues that are Phe 157, His 209 and Tyr 210. Docking predictions were confirmed by experimental measurements of the nucleotidase activity in the presence of the three best available phosphonate analogues, which were shown to induce a total inhibition of the cN-II activity at 2 mM. This study emphasizes the importance of the non-hydrolysable phosphonate bond in the design of new competitive cN-II inhibitors and the crucial hydrophobic stacking promoted by three protein residues. Nucleotidase activity was first described in 1934, and cN-II belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, with a specific reaction mechanism that requires the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate. The enzyme's activity can be regulated by several allosteric ligands such as ATP, ADP, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, dinucleosides polyphosphate or diadenosine tetraphosphate (activators) and inorganic phosphate (inhibitor). cN-II has several unique aspects, such as a complex regulation and substrate selectivity for IMP and GMP. The active form of cN-II is a homotetramer and its activity can be regulated by several allosteric ligands. Recently, a structural explanation was proposed for the allosteric regulation by an effector such as ATP, which induces a disorder-to-order transition of helix A. Aside from maintaining balanced nucleoside levels in the cell, cytoplasmic 5′-nucleotidases are likely to play an important role in the activity of nucleoside analogues used as antiviral or anticancer agents. There are several clinical evidences of a correlation between cN-II mRNA expression or activity in cancer cells and the outcome of patients treated with cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. In the case of acute myeloid leukemia, treatment involving cytarabine (ara-C) leads to a worse patient outcome when cN-II is highly expressed. This effect may be explained by tissue-specificity concerns or by variants at the NT5C2 locus gene encoding for cN-II. A high number of single nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be directly associated to cN-II expression and ara-C cytotoxicity or sensitivity in AML patients receiving the related chemotherapy. Another example of the implication of cN-II has been described in bone marrow cells of patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome. A correlation between clinical outcome of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with cladribine or fludarabine and their ratio of activities between dCK and cN-II has also been reported. The inhibition of cN-II expression by siRNA in astrocytoma cells was shown to induce cell death. These results suggest that cN-II is directly involved in the cytotoxicity of nucleoside analogues and that the modulation of cN-II could be an attractive strategy to influence the activity of cytotoxic nucleoside analogues or to directly induce cell death in cancer cells.
A study published in 2012 reported the detection of prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from sheep incubating natural scrapie. This is the first evidence of the presence of prions in mammary secretions from scrapie-affected ewes. The study found consistent levels of infectivity in colostrum and milk from sheep incubating scrapie, with the highest per milliliter infectious titre measured being equivalent to that contained in 6 µg of a terminally scrapie-affected ewe's posterior brain stem. The prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum from ewes with and without mammary gland lesions. The abnormal PrP was detected in lacteal ducts and mammary acini in ewes harboring mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles that developed as a result of Maedi lentivirus infection. The study also found that the infectivity could be recovered in the cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions of milk and colostrum. The infectious titre in colostrum and milk samples was estimated to range between 100, 1 and 101, 6 ID50/ml. The study suggests that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to the animal TSE transmission process, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. It also raises concerns regarding the risk to humans of TSE exposure associated with milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species.
An Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak began in Liberia in March 2014 and ended in January 2016, resulting in over 11,000 deaths in 10 countries, including 4,809 in Liberia. EVD is a severe illness in humans caused by the Ebola virus, with symptoms such as fever, hemorrhage, myalgia, and diarrhea. It is transmitted through contact with infected wildlife or body fluids of patients. In Liberia, data on 16,370 laboratory samples tested between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015 was analyzed, with 3,897 confirmed EVD cases (positive for Ebola virus RNA) identified. There were significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Age and place of residence were risk factors for death due to the disease. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. These findings can help support future investigations and understanding of the outbreak in Liberia.
The enzyme tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) catalyzes the conversion of phenol to the corresponding ortho-quinone through hydroxylation and oxidation reactions. It contains a dinuclear copper center in its active site, which takes three redox forms: deoxy (Cu(I)-Cu(I)), oxy (Cu(II)-O22--Cu(II)), and met (Cu(II)-Cu(II)). The met form is the resting enzymatic form, while the oxy form catalyzes the conversion of phenol and catechol substrates to ortho-quinones. The S. castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase met form is a dimer of two copper-depleted subunits, with each subunit containing a binuclear copper center. In the crystal structure of the S. castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase met form, each copper ion is coordinated by three histidine residues, with a bridging water molecule between them. However, in the oxy form, the water molecule is replaced by a peroxide ion, which binds to the copper ions in a side-on bridging mode. In the crystal structure of the tyrosinase-caddie complex, the Tyr98 residue of the caddie protein is present in the active-site pocket of tyrosinase, and its side chain forms hydrogen bonds with Wat2 and Wat3. In the met2 form, the Tyr98 residue is converted to dopaquinone, which stimulates the aggregation of the caddie protein and the dissociation of tyrosinase from the complex. Reaction intermediates, such as μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper (II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone, were able to be trapped, indicating that the Tyr98 residue is converted to dopaquinone through these intermediates. The crystal structures of tyrosinase at different stages of the reaction were determined to visualize the process in the tyrosinase reaction toward the caddie Tyr98 residue. The crystal structures were cryo-trapped after the aerobic soaking of the crystal of met2-tyrosinase complexed with the caddie protein in a buffer containing CuSO4 and NH2OH for a given time at 25°C. The results showed that the tyrosinase may be suitable to take a flexible bent-butterfly structure in the oxy form to allow the conformational change during the reaction.
In the process of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, the early steps of the production of the large ribosomal subunit are the least understood. The first precursor to the yeast large ribosomal subunit, the first pre-60S particle, contains 30 assembly factors (AFs), including 8 RNA helicases. One of these helicases, Dbp6p, is essential for the normal accumulation of the first pre-60S pre-ribosomal particle in S. cerevisiae. Dbp6p associates with a complex of four AFs, namely Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, and Rsa3p, prior to their incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosomal particles. Npa1p forms the backbone of the complex and is essential for the insertion of the Dbp6p helicase within 90S pre-ribosomal particles. Npa1p and Dbp6p function in the formation and/or clustering of root helices of large subunit rRNAs which creates the core of the large ribosomal subunit RNA structure. The Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions. Dbp6p, Dbp7p, Dbp9p, and Prp43p, which belong to the family of RNA helicases, are likely to play crucial roles in pre-rRNA folding and compaction events during large subunit ribosomal proteins assembly. Nop8p, Dbp6p, and Rsa3p form a complex associated with 90S and early pre-60S pre-ribosomal particles and are recruited within 90S pre-ribosomal particles, remain present within the earliest pre-60S particles containing the 27SA2 pre-rRNA and dissociate from 27SB-containing pre-60S particles. Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, Dbp6p, and Rsa3p can form one or several complexes, with which Dbp6p interacts but such association is magnesium sensitive.
The ability to adapt to a changing world is crucial for survival, and is achieved through the updating of beliefs in response to unexpected events that signal potential environmental change. This belief updating is driven by prediction errors, which are the difference between predicted and actual outcomes. The degree to which each prediction error influences existing beliefs is determined by the learning rate. Recent studies have examined the computational mechanisms by which various environmental factors determine the impact of new outcomes on existing beliefs, but the brain mechanisms involved in this process are still largely unknown. However, recent research suggests that the catecholamine systems, specifically norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), are well-positioned to regulate learning rate based on environmental change. This research provides converging evidence for a causal role of the human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change. The study found that the P3 component of the EEG, an electrophysiological index of outcome-evoked phasic catecholamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and formally mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning rate. P3 amplitude also mediated the effects of two computational variables, capturing the unexpectedness of an outcome and the uncertainty of a preexisting belief, on learning rate. A pharmacological manipulation of catecholamine activity affected learning rate following unanticipated task changes, in a way that depended on participants’ baseline learning rate. These findings highlight the importance of the catecholamine systems in the regulation of learning rate and the ability to adapt to a changing environment.
Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant challenge to humanity, with the World Health Organization reporting millions of deaths each year due to communicable diseases. To monitor and surveillance these diseases, various strategies have been developed, including disease-specific surveillance, syndromic surveillance, and event-based surveillance. These strategies utilize a variety of data sources, including notifiable diseases reports, microbiology orders reports, and data from Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories. POC laboratories, which are on-site laboratories equipped to perform a wide variety of rapid diagnostic tests, have become increasingly important in monitoring and diagnosing infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries where access to conventional laboratories may be limited.In the rural Saloum region of Senegal, two POC laboratories have been successfully implemented and have been used to test over 2,500 patients for 15 different pathogens. A homemade syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC has been implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data produced by these POC laboratories. The implementation of EPIMIC in Senegal allowed for the real-time monitoring of the number of samples tested and positives performed every week, as well as the percentage of positivity for each test. When the number of tested samples, positive samples, or percentage of positiveness exceeded predetermined thresholds, alarms were automatically emitted by EPIMIC. This allowed for the rapid detection and response to potential outbreaks.The implementation of EPIMIC in Senegal was successful in identifying alarms for various pathogens, including Plasmodium falciparum, Rickettsia spp, and Borrelia spp. The system was able to detect numerous true epidemiological events without heavy human and economic resources, demonstrating its scalability and versatility. Additionally, the system was fully automated for the collection, anonymisation, and analysis of data, and for the production of a simple Microsoft PowerPoint activity report. This improvement considerably decreased the level of complexity to use the software and facilitated on-site investigations of validated abnormal events.In conclusion, the implementation of EPIMIC in Senegal using data routinely produced by two POC laboratories in rural villages has been successful in monitoring and surveillance infectious diseases. The system was able to detect numerous true epidemiological events and provided valuable information on the local epidemiology of emerging pathogens. The use of POC laboratories and syndromic surveillance systems, such as EPIMIC, are crucial in the ongoing effort to monitor and control infectious diseases, especially in developing countries where access to conventional laboratories may be limited.
This study investigates the role of cellular architecture in intercellular communication and calcium signaling in endothelial cells. The study found that the structural arrangement of endothelial cells affected their ability to collectively signal and respond to histamine stimulation. Specifically, cells in self-assembled and microengineered networks, but not individual cells or monolayers, exhibited calcium oscillations in response to histamine. The calcium oscillation was dependent on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), and attenuated the histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction. The study suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling.Calcium signaling is a universal second messenger that mediates a wide range of dynamic cell functions, such as exocytosis, contraction, transcription, and proliferation. The study found that histamine, known to induce calcium signaling and cell contraction in endothelial cells, induced calcium oscillations in a much larger portion of cells in self-assembled capillary-like networks and plasma lithography microengineered cell networks. The occurrence rate of calcium oscillation was significantly reduced when endothelial cells in capillary-like networks and hexagonal cell networks were pretreated with a gap junction blocker, 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA), indicating the architecture-dependent calcium oscillation is GJIC dependent.A computational model was used to study the mechanisms of architecture-dependent calcium oscillation and the effect of calcium diffusion and coupling current on calcium dynamics. The computational model captured the essence of calcium dynamics observed in the experiment, supporting its use for investigating the architecture-dependent calcium signaling. The computational simulation captured the architecture-dependent calcium signaling observed in the experiment, with individual cells not exhibiting calcium oscillations and most cells exhibiting calcium oscillation in linear chain coupled cells. When the cells were connected in an array and coupled to each other, the calcium oscillations vanished in all of the cells, similar to the experimental observation. The computational model also predicted that the calcium dynamics are sensitive to the number of cells coupled.In summary, this study has demonstrated that cellular architecture plays a significant role in GJIC-mediated collective calcium signaling. The study found that cells in capillary-like networks and hexagonal cell networks display short calcium pulses and oscillations after histamine treatment, unlike monolayers and individual cells that exhibit prolonged cytosolic calcium response. The calcium oscillation was dependent on GJIC and attenuated the histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction. The study highlights the importance of considering cellular architecture in the understanding of calcium signaling and its functional implications in diverse vascular structures.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children, and continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The RSV surface protein G has been identified as a major target for vaccine development due to its ability to generate a broad antibody response following infection. In a previous study, it was shown that a whole genome-fragment phage display library (GFPDL) expressing linear and conformational epitopes from RSV bound 100-fold more phages within the attachment protein (G) following primary RSV infection in infants. These G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-termini of G ectodomain, as well as the central conserved domain (CCD). In a more recent study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of all RSV-G antigenic sites identified following primary RSV infection were evaluated using recombinant E. coli expressed G ectodomain (REG), CCD-deleted G ectodomain (REG ΔCCD), N- and C-terminal G subdomains, and antigenic site peptides. The REG ΔCCD, N- and C-terminal subdomains and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound to fully glycosylated Recombinant Mammalian expressed G ectodomain (RMG) and intact RSV virion particles but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared with the intact G ectodomain. Vaccinated mice challenged intranasally with RSV-A2 Line 19F showed significantly reduced viral replication in both the nasal cavity and lungs compared to unimmunized controls, and control of viral loads post-RSV challenge correlated with serum antibody binding to the virus particles. These findings suggest that multiple protective sites in RSV G protein outside of the CCD could contribute to the development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein as a safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease. Further research is necessary to fully understand the complex immune response to RSV and the role of G protein in protective immunity.
During embryonic development, genetic cues control neuronal diversity, with intrinsic transcriptional cascades determining neuronal sub-type cell fate, and target cells providing input for specific neuronal cell fates through retrograde signals. These retrograde signals act as survival and differentiation cues for neurons. In Drosophila, a BMP signal from target cells activates the FMRFa gene in Tv4 neurons of the ventral nerve cord, and a recent study found that brr2 and Prp8, encoding components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, play crucial roles in controlling the expression of the FMRFa neuropeptide specifically in six neurons of the VNC (Tv4 neurons). Brr2 controls this expression through two independent mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to the target tissue to receive the BMP ligand, and proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway, the thickveins (tkv) gene encoding a BMP receptor subunit, and the Medea gene encoding a co-Smad. These findings highlight the importance of post-transcriptional modulations in controlling the identity of individual cells during neural specification processes. Additionally, splicing mechanisms play an essential role in generating cellular diversity during development, including alternate splicing, which plays a major part in the generation of protein variation and regulatory elements specific to certain cell types or tissues.
In order to maintain a diverse range of SCF complexes, the abundance of F-box proteins, a key component of SCF ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), must be tightly controlled. Misregulation of substrate receptor components, particularly for the largest class of CRLs, the SCF ligases, has been associated with numerous diseases including cancer. A key mechanism controlling F-box protein abundance is autocatalytic ubiquitylation by intact SCF complex followed by proteasome-mediated degradation. However, a study on the yeast Met30 F-box protein has identified an additional pathway for regulation. This pathway involves ubiquitylation and degradation of Met30 that is dissociated from Skp1, and requires the cullin component Cdc53/Cul1 but is independent of the other central SCF component Skp1. This non-canonical degradation pathway is critical for chromosome stability and effective defense against heavy metal stress, and is assigned important biological functions to a sub-complex of cullin-RING ligases that comprises Cdc53/Rbx1/Cdc34, but is independent of Skp1. This demonstrates that cullin-RING ligases can have functions independent of their adaptor component Skp1, and adds to the understanding of how cells maintain F-box protein homeostasis.
Kinesin-3 motors, specifically KIF1A, are responsible for the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, these motors are kept inactive to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis and motility. The current model suggests that KIF1A is monomeric in the inactive state and becomes active through concentration-driven dimerization on the cargo membrane. However, recent studies have found that both native and expressed KIF1A proteins are dimeric in the inactive state, contradicting the previous model. The researchers propose that KIF1A motors are autoinhibited by two distinct inhibitory mechanisms, rather than being activated by cargo-induced dimerization. The researchers also found that KIF1A motors can undergo one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice, and only dimeric motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. This finding suggests that KIF1A may be uniquely suited to use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells. In summary, these findings challenge the current model of KIF1A motor regulation and highlight the importance of understanding the regulation of kinesin motors in enabling the transport of the correct cargo to the proper cellular destination at the relevant time.
A study was conducted to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism and estimate the natural variability in metabolites of tomato introgression lines (ILs) grown in two harvest seasons. Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) with the genotypic background being the main factor for metabolic polymorphism. The ILs showed greater phenotypic plasticity than the M82 cultivar. Broad-sense estimate of heritability suggested that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in the seed differed from that in the fruit. Correlation-based metabolic network analysis showed that the seed network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than the fruit. Amino acids in the seed metabolic network played a central hub-like role in the topology of the network. Six exceptionally highly co-regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro, were identified, reflecting the extensive redundancy of the regulation underlying seed metabolism. The study highlights the added value of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping. Tomatoes are one of the most important crops worldwide, used mainly for human consumption, and constitute the best-studied fruit-bearing model organism. The domestication of tomato has led to the erosion of its genetic variability, leading to the loss of valuable traits. Strategies based on the exploitation of natural variation are being employed to reintroduce the lost genetic variation into cultivated species. The study used a set of 76 ILs, each carrying a small chromosomal portion of a distant relative within the chromosomal background of the domesticated tomato. Seeds harvested from two consecutive seasons of all 76 ILs and of M82 were subjected to GC-MS analysis for metabolic profiling. The findings are discussed with respect to recent advances in the regulation of plant metabolism. The study aimed to identify potential QTL involved in the regulation of metabolites in the tomato seed and mapped 354 significant changes in metabolite content, represented on the IL map by a color code referring to the different compound classes. The IL map suggests that a distinct group of amino acids (Gly, Ile, Pro, Ser, Val, Thr) are co-localized onto particular introgressions, indicating a shared regulatory mechanism for TCA cycle intermediates. Most variability in sugar levels was observed to be subject to seasonal influence. The study confirmed 30 out of the 46 previously suggested mQTL by the genotype term (IL), the interaction term (season * IL), or both (IL+season * IL). The analysis indicated the genotype as the major factor controlling metabolite content, with the IL factor exhibiting the most extensive impact on the variance of the dataset. The study calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) on the background of the seed and of the fruit, showing greater phenotypic plasticity in the introgressed background than in that of M82. The H2 bar plot revealed a positive skewness in the distribution pattern of the fruit values, while seed values displayed a near-normal distribution. Intriguingly, six occurrences (traits) exceeding 0.5 were scored in the background of the seed population, whereas none of the H2 values in the background of the fruit population exceeded 0.5. The patterns observed suggest greater broad-sense heritability of metabolic abundance in the seed than in the fruit.
Vibrio cholerae, a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, causes cholera, a severe diarrheal disease in humans. The bacterium has been found to colonize both aquatic environments, such as the chitinous exoskeletons of zooplankton, and the human gastrointestinal tract. A protein called GbpA (GlcNAc binding protein A) has been identified as a key factor in this colonization process. GbpA has been shown to bind to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) containing carbohydrates, such as chitin, and is secreted by the type 2 secretion system.Structural studies have revealed that GbpA has an unusual, elongated four-domain structure, with structural homology to chitin binding domains in domains 1 and 4. The protein has been found to bind to GlcNAc oligosaccharides, and structure-guided GbpA truncation mutants have shown that domains 1 and 4 of GbpA interact with chitin in vitro. In vivo complementation studies have further shown that domain 1 is crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Domains 2 and 3 of GbpA have been found to bind to the V. cholerae surface. Mouse virulence assays have shown that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization.These results suggest that GbpA provides structural and functional modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons. The ability of GbpA to bind to both chitin and mucin indicates that it plays a crucial role in the initial stages of V. cholerae colonization in both aquatic environments and the human gastrointestinal tract. The finding that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization suggests that the protein may be a viable target for the development of cholera vaccines and therapies.
Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a complex disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and claimed the lives of 1.7 million people in 2016. The disease is more severe and drug-resistant strains are increasingly prevalent, making it a major global health concern. The BCG vaccine is the only available vaccine, but it is not effective in preventing new infection and reactivation in adults. The CD4+ T cell compartment plays a crucial role in immunity to TB, and Th1 effector cytokines, such as IFNγ and IL-12, are particularly important. Treg cells are responsible for suppressing Teff cell proliferation and cytokine expression, and maintaining an efficacious anti-TB Teff response is dependent on counter-regulation by Treg cells. In PTB, Treg cells expand early in Mtb infection and play a role in delaying the generation of IFNγ producing CD4+ Teff cells, but their role in the chronic phase of TB is less clear. A study found that Treg cells from PTB patients suppress heterologous IGRA-ve Teff cells as efficiently as allogeneic/autologous Teff cells, but the capacity of competent Treg cells from IGRA-ve subjects to suppress Teff of PTB patients was significantly compromised. On the other hand, Treg cells from PTB patients suppress heterologous IGRA-ve Teff cells as efficiently as allogeneic/autologous Teff cells. These findings suggest that despite having functional Treg cells similar to that of IGRA-ve controls, PTB patients have Teff cells that are resistant to Treg mediated suppression. Recent studies show expansion of HLA-DR+ and CD38+ CD4+ T cells in PTB and HIV-TB co-infection. Elevated HLA-DR on CD4+ T cells was found to positively correlate with TB disease risk in BCG vaccinated infants. On memory Teff cells, the most striking difference was in the frequency of HLA-DR expressing cells, with PTB subjects having a 2-2.6 fold higher median frequency compared to that of IGRA-ve controls or IGRA+ve individuals. In contrast, CD38+ and PD-1+ Teff frequencies did not vary significantly between the clinical groups. These findings suggest that elevated expression of HLA-DR alone on Teff cells is sufficient for discriminating PTB from healthy controls and treated individuals. The fraction of HLA-DR+ Teff cells in PTB, representing activated Teff, may contribute to resistance to Treg-mediated suppression. HLA-DR+ cells were therefore depleted from the Teff cell pool of TB patients by cell sorting, and depletion of HLA-DR+ cells restored suppression in cells from PTB subjects.
In this study, the researchers investigated the effect of post-translational modifications of PrPC on the fidelity of strain propagation in prion infection. They used transgenic mice lacking the PrP GPI signal sequence on a PrP null background (tgGPI− mice) and inoculated them with different prion strains. They found that RML and ME7 prions propagated in tgGPI− mice developed novel cell tropisms and had higher levels of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc (PrPres) than in wild-type brain. When ME7 prions were returned to wild-type mice, they recovered their original properties, but RML prions had given rise to a novel prion strain, SFL, which remained unchanged after three passages in wild-type mice. The researchers propose that the two conformations are separated by a high activation energy barrier which is abrogated in tgGPI− mice. Additionally, the study found that using the sandwich assay for the quantitation of PrPres revealed unusually high levels of PrPres in RML and ME7 prions propagating in GPI− mice, likely due to greater stability of extracellular as compared to intracellular PrPres.
The BMP signaling pathway is conserved across species and has a crucial role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development. In Drosophila, BMP signaling is regulated by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. In this study, researchers used Drosophila embryos as a model to investigate the BMP-responsive transcriptional network underpinning dorsal ectoderm differentiation during dorsal-ventral axis patterning. They combined RNA-seq with Mad and Brinker ChIP-seq and found multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. They discovered that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription, and the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property that balances its activity with the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway for correct patterning. Additionally, they identified key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain and found widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. The findings highlight the complexity of the BMP pathway and its regulation, which is critical for proper embryonic development. The study's findings are relevant to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates and contribute to understanding the role of BMP signaling in embryonic development.
"In Tunisia, the prevalence of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major has been increasing and spreading from the south-west to central regions. A study was conducted to analyze the evolution and population dynamics of L. major in human isolates from Tunisian governorates where ZCL is endemic (Gafsa, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid) by using multi-locus microsatellite typing and F-statistics and Bayesian model-based approach. The results showed that the genetic patterns of 2008-2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia. Human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes may explain the disease progression. The study provides new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia and highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations. ZCL, also known as ""Le Bouton de Gafsa,"" is a typical model of emerging and reemerging zoonosis and has been endemic in the Gafsa region for many years. The disease has spread to other governorates, including Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid, causing substantial morbidity due to chronic skin ulcers and psychological effects of disfigurement. The majority of L. major strains isolated in Tunisia belong to the MON-25 zymodeme. The study aimed to analyze the spatio-temporal organization of L. major in the three main endemic areas of ZCL in Tunisia (Gafsa, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid governorates) by using a multi-locus microsatellite typing approach and population genetic statistical methods. The study used human isolates collected in the three governorates between 2008 and 2012 and identified the parasites as L. major by sequence analysis of the gene encoding RNA polymerase II in combination with the MLEE technique. The study found that the genotypic diversity of L. major was high in these three areas, and unique genotypes and original microsatellite profiles were identified in the isolates. The intraspecific genetic diversity (Hs) was highest in the Gafsa and lowest in the Sidi Bouzid isolates, and the allelic richness (A) and the mean observed heterozygosity (Ho) decreased progressively from Gafsa to Sidi Bouzid. The mean expected heterozygosity (He) values were much higher than the Ho values in all three populations, indicating a deficit in heterozygosity in all three populations. The FST values, which are used as a measure of genetic differentiation between populations, were significantly different between the GF2008-2012 and SBZ2008-2012 isolates and between the GF2008-2012 and KR2008-2012 isolates. The Bayesian model-based clustering analysis implemented in STRUCTURE indicated that the dataset could be organized in four or two clusters. For K = 2, 92% of L. major isolates from Gafsa, 10% from Kairouan, and 38% from Sidi Bouzid were included in one of the inferred clusters, indicating that the three populations were not genetically distinct."
The study conducted in Kenya focused on the impact of different interventions on helminth infections in HIV-infected adults. The study found that deworming is effective in reducing the probability of helminth infections, but with the exception of safe flooring, WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) offers minimal additional benefit in reducing the probability of infection. However, WASH does appear to significantly reduce infection prevalence in adults who are not treated with chemotherapy. The study also found that mass drug administration (MDA) for controlling helminth infections is influenced by treatment coverage, prevalence and intensity of different helminth species, drug susceptibility, and socio-behavioral patterns that influence infection and re-infection rates. Other strategies, including WASH interventions, may be needed to reduce the risk of reinfection and ultimately to break transmission of schistosomiasis and STH. Data from a meta-analysis of water and hygiene protective measures suggest that drinking treated water, soap use, and wearing shoes were associated with approximately 45-60% lower odds of infection. Access to and utilization of sanitation facilities is also associated with significant reductions in the prevalence of all three major STH infections. Despite these associations, data from randomized trials evaluating the impact of WASH interventions have demonstrated minimal or no benefit in reducing STH prevalence or intensity in children. Integrating WASH and MDA strategies may be a promising approach to eliminating disease transmission, however, data are limited.
Lectin-like bacteriotoxic proteins, specifically LlpABW from Pseudomonas putida, are able to kill closely related bacterial species, including several phytopathogens, by a mechanism that remains unknown. The crystal structure of LlpABW reveals it has an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain (C-domain) has a mannose-binding site, and mutational analysis shows that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal MMBL domain (N-domain) lacks a functional mannose-binding site but determines target specificity. Bacteriocins, including LlpABW, are a diverse group of protein toxins used by bacteria to inhibit competitors. Pseudomonas species produce R- and F-type pyocins, which attach to specific lipopolysaccharide moieties or dock onto surface-exposed targets, causing depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane or nucleic acid degradation, respectively. LlpABW represents a class of Pseudomonas-specific antibacterial proteins not related to any known bacteriocin. Additional llpA-like genes encoding functional bacteriocins have been identified in the biocontrol strain Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 and the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 642, as well as in two Xanthomonas pathovars. The LlpA branch occupies a unique position among MMBL-domain proteins and has the capacity to kill bacterial cells with bacteriocin-like specificity.
In Bacillus subtilis, sporulation involves two cells that follow separate but coordinately regulated developmental programs. The forespore, the future spore, is located within the mother cell. The regulation of the forespore transcription factor σG, which acts at a late stage of sporulation, has been unclear. It has been discovered that σG activity requires eight mother-cell proteins encoded in the spoIIIA operon and the forespore protein SpoIIQ. Several of the SpoIIIA proteins share similarity with components of specialized secretion systems. The SpoIIIA proteins and SpoIIQ form a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore and are required to maintain forespore integrity. In the absence of these proteins, the forespore develops large invaginations and collapses. This maintenance of forespore integrity does not require σG, indicating that forespore collapse is not a result of the failure to activate σG. These results support a model in which the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ proteins form a novel secretion apparatus that allows the mother cell to nurture the forespore, thereby maintaining forespore physiology and σG activity during spore maturation. This is important in the context of cell-cell communication, which plays a key role in coordinating gene expression during spore formation and the development of multi-cellular organisms, microbial pathogenesis, and communities of microorganisms.
A genome-wide association study was conducted on a combined sample of 2,191 bipolar disorder (BD) cases and 1,434 controls, using genotype data from the GAIN and TGEN initiatives. Although no genome-wide significant associations were detected, there was evidence of an association between the power to detect effects and evidence for replication (P=1.5×10−7). When considering the development and application of a multilocus schizophrenia-based genetic risk 'score' across many SNPs, a probable polygenic basis for BD was indicated. A strong association was found between power to detect a SNP based on association statistics observed in one study and replication in another study. This relationship was assessed in a way that allows for the assessment of collections of SNPs in defined genomic regions to test hypotheses about the nature of genetic variation mediating BD susceptibility. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibited a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results suggest that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies. Additionally, this approach provides a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies.
A study has been conducted to understand the determinants of cancer proliferation and to find new anti-cancer drug targets by employing a computational approach. This approach aims to quantify the association between the expression levels of genes and growth rate measurements across 60 cancer cell lines, assigning each gene a cancer Proliferation Index (cPI). The study found that genes essential in cancer gene knockdown screens exhibit significant positive cPI values, while tumor suppressors exhibit significant negative cPI values. Cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production-related processes are positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration is negatively associated with it. A comparison of genes' non-cancerous proliferation indices (nPI) across 224 lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed marked differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation, highlighting genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins. A cross-species comparison revealed that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, while non-cancerous proliferation does not. Combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures leads to enhanced prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer. Overall, these results suggest that understanding the inherent difference between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation determinants may contribute to the future development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, affecting humans who act as intermediate hosts. It is endemic in several regions including Europe, North and East Africa, India, China, Indonesia, and the Southern Cone of the Americas. The heart is involved in less than 2% of CE cases, and endovascular extracardiac CE is even rarer. A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular CE, followed-up over a period of 15 years (1995-2009), is reported. The main clinical manifestations included thoracic pain or dyspnea, although 2 patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were located mostly in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment. The case series highlights that cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications and should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve outcomes in these patients.
TirS, a TIR mimic from Staphylococcus aureus, plays a crucial role in the bacterium's virulence and innate immune evasion. Found within staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance, TirS inhibits TLR signaling and the NF-kB pathway, reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators. In mouse models, skin lesions induced by the tirS-mutant are larger than those caused by wild-type and restored strains, with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity. Epidemiological studies show a selective advantage for SCCmec elements with SCC fusC/tirS, linking two key traits determining the success and spread of bacterial infections. TirS is a TIR homolog protein carried by a mobile genetic element conferring resistance to antibiotics, suggesting a potential selective advantage and contributing to the ability of S. aureus to survive and establish a critical population size.
The evolution of organisms can be driven by spatial and temporal changes in gene expression. This is seen in the embryos of lower and higher Diptera, where the ancient extraembryonic envelope composed of amnion and serosa in mosquitoes is reduced to the single amnioserosa in fruit flies. A study was conducted to investigate whole-genome changes in gene expression underlying differences in the embryonic morphologies of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. The researchers used transcriptional datasets collected during the embryonic development of both species and found that many orthologous gene pairs could be clustered based on the presence of coincident discordances in their temporal expression profiles. One such cluster contained genes expressed specifically in the mosquito serosa, which is redeployed later in development at the time of cuticle synthesis. Additionally, there is a striking difference in the temporal expression of a subset of maternal genes, with maternal transcripts that exhibit a sharp reduction at the time of the maternal-zygotic transition in Drosophila displaying sustained expression in the Anopheles embryo. The researchers propose that gene clustering by local temporal discordance can be used for the de novo identification of the gene batteries underlying morphological diversity. This study provides a conceptual and computational framework for cross-organismal temporal alignments and comparisons of species-specific transcriptional datasets, and the resulting heatmaps of discordant gene clusters identified distinctive patterning properties in Dipteran embryos, including the organization of extra-embryonic tissues and the maternal-zygotic transition. The study also suggests that the heatmaps and alignments of gene expression datasets obtained with the time warping algorithm suggest a near linear relationship in their embryonic development, with a subtle deviation from linearity at stage 9, presumably shortly after serosa completion in Anopheles. The removal of serosal genes from the datasets did not result in change in the automatic alignment path, suggesting that this time point may indeed represent temporarily local slow down of gene expression programs in Anopheles embryo proper compared to Drosophila.
A study was conducted to investigate the presence of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, which cause leg ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific Region, on asymptomatic people, flies, and household linens in an endemic setting. The study was carried out in rural villages of Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, during a yaws elimination campaign. The study found that 21% of asymptomatic participants had H. ducreyi-PCR positivity and 1% had T. p. pertenue-PCR positivity. The study also demonstrated skin colonization of H. ducreyi in 12% of cultures obtained from asymptomatic participants. Moreover, 90% of flies tested had H. ducreyi DNA and 50% had T. p. pertenue DNA. Additionally, 33% of bed sheets sampled had H. ducreyi DNA and 17% had T. p. pertenue DNA. This is the first time that H. ducreyi DNA and colonization, as well as T. p. pertenue DNA, has been demonstrated in flies and on fomites. The ubiquity of H. ducreyi in the environment is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the role of asymptomatic carriage, flies, and fomites in the transmission and persistence of H. ducreyi and T. p. pertenue in endemic areas.
Bioinformatics is a crucial part of many biomedical and healthcare careers, although there is no agreement on what the knowledge base for this field entails or how to best provide it. The International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of core bioinformatics competencies to address this issue, targeting various user personas and training programs. These competencies have been refined through a multi-year process of community engagement and are being applied in diverse training contexts. The need for bioinformatics education is immense, with different audiences requiring varying skills and knowledge. The ISCB Education Committee’s Curriculum Task Force has further refined these competencies and presented use cases illustrating their application in various bioinformatics education and training programs globally.The use cases presented in the report are grouped into three categories: complete degree programs, supplements to existing degree programs, and training resources outside the context of specific degree programs. These use cases demonstrate the value of the competencies in defining, refining, or assessing bioinformatics training mechanisms. The Task Force's efforts to develop and refine a set of core competencies for bioinformatics training have sought to assist educators by providing a conceptual framework for sharing experiences, identifying best practices, and addressing divergent needs and expectations.Although the core competencies are not a prescription for specific curricula or curricular standards, they provide a basis for the community of bioinformatics educators to draw upon common experiences in designing, refining, and evaluating their training programs. Moving forward, the Task Force plans to detail its guidelines in a manner similar to the CourseSource framework and provide explicit mappings between the competencies and existing frameworks, such as CourseSource, NHS clinical bioinformatics, Edison data science, and ABET. The ultimate goal is to map courses to competencies for each of the personas in the ISCB competency framework, with examples already available for life scientists, clinical practitioners, and data scientists, among others.
The infectious form of many parasitic nematodes, including those causing significant diseases in humans and substantial agricultural losses, is a developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3i). The life cycle of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis includes both parasitic and free-living forms, making it possible to study the mechanisms of L3i arrest and activation using this species. The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a developmentally arrested larval form, the dauer, whose formation is controlled by four pathways: cGMP signaling, IIS, TGFβ signaling, and DA ligands that regulate a nuclear hormone receptor. It has been hypothesized that homologous pathways are present in S. stercoralis and are involved in L3i arrest and activation. To test this, a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome of S. stercoralis was conducted, generating over 2.3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages. Genes encoding cGMP pathway components were found to be coordinately up-regulated in L3i, and genes encoding IIS ligands and TGFβ ligands were also identified, with several having abundance profiles suggesting involvement in L3i development. However, putative DA biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3i development. These findings suggest that while dauer pathway genes are present in S. stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species. Understanding the mechanisms governing L3i development may lead to novel treatment and control strategies.
Bacterial genotoxins, specifically Colibactin and Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT), are frequently involved in digestive cancers and can lead to nuclear remodeling. This remodeling includes the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells, known as the Nucleoplasmic Reticulum (NR). These structures have been observed in vitro and in vivo in mice infected with Helicobacter and in cell cultures treated with Colibactin and CDT-secreting bacteria. The NR contains ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the mCRD involved in mRNA turnover. They are active sites of mRNA translation and are associated with a high degree of ploidy, involving MAPK and calcium signaling. The NR is a dynamic and transient structure that protects the cell until the genotoxic stress is relieved. The findings suggest that bacterial genotoxins-induced NR could be a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be preferentially transported therein for local translation. These discoveries offer new insights into the context of NR formation, which not only appears in response to therapies-induced DNA damage but also earlier in response to genotoxic bacteria.
Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease, can cause facial deformation, including maxillary changes. While saddle nose is well-known, maxillary regression is also a significant issue. In this study, researchers used 3D-CT imaging to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in former leprosy patients and control subjects. They found that three former patients with lepromatous leprosy had marked atrophy of the maxilla, consistent with paleopathological findings. The 3D-CT imaging allowed for precise measurement and calculation of bone defects, which could aid in reconstructive surgery. This study confirmed the presence of maxillary regression in living patients with leprosy, highlighting the need for fundamental corrective treatments for facies leprosa or rhinomaxillary syndrome.
The auditory system faces the challenge of identifying behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise, and an elegant solution to this problem is for the auditory system to represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion. This can be achieved by neurons adapting to stimulus statistics, as a major effect of background noise is to alter the statistics of the sounds reaching the ear. A study investigated the extent of neuronal adaptation to the mean and contrast of auditory stimulation as one ascends the auditory pathway. They recorded neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus and primary fields of the auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets and compared these responses with a sophisticated model of the auditory nerve. They found that the strength of both forms of adaptation increases as one ascends the auditory pathway. Additionally, populations that show the strongest adaptation to stimulus statistics are also the most noise-tolerant, suggesting that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from auditory nerve to midbrain to cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain. Overall, this study suggests that neural adaptation to stimulus statistics is a neural mechanism for the construction of noise-invariant representations.
Network analysis has become a powerful tool, providing new insights into cellular behavior, with heat shock used as a model of cellular dynamics. The protein-protein interaction network (interactome) of S. cerevisiae, a well-characterized organism, has been used to study the reorganization of the yeast interactome during stress. The major finding of the study is that heat shock induces a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules, resulting in a partial disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome. This change may be a general mechanism occurring in many types of stresses and other complex systems, such as single proteins, social networks, and ecosystems. The study of the yeast interactome under heat shock provides a model of a general, system-level adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
Chagas disease, a neglected chronic condition prevalent in Latin America and caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, results in high morbidity and mortality rates. Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, are common in Chagas cardiomyopathy. Although amiodarone has been widely used to manage ventricular arrhythmias in Chagas cardiomyopathy, its efficacy and safety have not been comprehensively evaluated. A systematic review of studies assessing amiodarone's effect on patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy was conducted. Nine studies, including three before-after studies, five case series, and one randomized controlled trial, were included in the review. The review found that amiodarone reduced ventricular tachycardia episodes, ventricular premature beats, and the incidence of ventricular couplets in 24-hour Holter monitoring. However, amiodarone was associated with several side effects, including corneal microdeposits, gastrointestinal events, sinus bradycardia, dermatological events, and drug discontinuation. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Therefore, while amiodarone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias in Chagas cardiomyopathy, its use should be balanced with potential benefits and harms at the individual level. Further studies are needed to establish the drug's effect on hard endpoints such as sudden death and hospitalization.
Seasonality is a crucial factor in infectious diseases, including arboviruses spread by mosquitoes such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. These diseases are influenced by climatic or environmental factors like temperature and rainfall, as well as human behavioral time trends such as school year schedules, holidays, and weekday-weekend patterns. A study was conducted using medical record data from patients diagnosed with dengue fever at two hospitals in rural Ecuador between 2009-2016 to determine the short- and long-term seasonal patterns of dengue fever, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays. The study found that dengue fever diagnoses were more likely on Tuesdays and Thursdays and less likely on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays, except for the day after Christmas, were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses. School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. Climate factors such as monthly total precipitation, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly precipitation days, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days were significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses. This study provides important insights into local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, and global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
In the ongoing battle against viral infections, scientists are constantly seeking solutions to protect against a diverse range of viral threats, many of which lack effective vaccines or treatment strategies. A recent study has uncovered a promising approach to boost innate immunity, providing broad-spectrum antiviral protection. This novel method involves transgenic expression of a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in mammalian cells.Researchers found that transgenic mice expressing a picornavirus RdRP exhibited life-long, heightened activation of the innate immune system, leading to dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This powerful antiviral state, mediated by MDA5 and MAVS, conferred profound resistance to various lethal viral challenges without triggering harmful autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. Human cell models mirrored these results, with the RdRP inducing an analogous ISG network and a strict block to HIV-1 infection.The RdRP-induced antiviral mechanism operates independently of the adaptive immune system and does not rely on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA. Instead, it functions at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis. Notably, lifelong massive ISG elevations in RdRP mice did not result in any adverse health effects or shortened lifespans.These findings suggest that a highly augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated configuration of the innate immune system, providing a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection. The success of this approach could pave the way for novel strategies to enhance innate immunity and safeguard against an array of viral threats.
The effective population size (Ne) is a critical factor in viral evolution, influencing the strength of genetic drift and the frequency of co-infection by multiple genotypes. However, experimental estimates of Ne for different plant viruses have provided varying results. The Independent Action Hypothesis (IAH) proposes that each virion has a probability of infection and acts independently during the infection process, with Ne being dose-dependent. While the IAH has not been tested for a plant virus, a study using Tobacco etch virus (TEV) variants with GFP or mCherry fluorescent markers, in Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants, found that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose, following a Poisson distribution, and that Ne was dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The study highlights the importance of considering dose effects when comparing Ne estimates for different viruses and suggests that independent action may be a common characteristic in viral infection processes. However, the study also notes the need for further examination of the IAH's applicability to RNA viruses and other pathosystems.
The paper proposes Sparse Bayesian Regression models for eQTL mapping within individual tissues and across tissues, demonstrating increased power in revealing the true complexity of the eQTL landscape at the systems-level. The method, when tested on a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues, identified a two-eQTL model (cis/trans) for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and not detected by conventional approaches. The method showed common genetic regulation of gene expression across four tissues for ~27% of transcripts, providing a >5 fold increase in eQTLs detection compared to single tissue analyses at a 5% FDR level. These findings offer a new opportunity to uncover complex genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling global gene expression, with broad application to analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes in various model systems and humans. Despite the advancements in integrated transcriptional profiling and linkage mapping studies, few methods have addressed the problem of jointly performing an analysis of gene expression across tissues combined with multivariate analysis of a large number of genetic control points. Statistical methods for multiple QTL analyses have followed current developments of sparse regression methods designed to address the large p, small n paradigm. In the eQTL context, regularisation methods have been proposed for single and multiple phenotypes, but interpretability of the genetic effects and adequate characterisation of uncertainty are crucial. The Bayesian variable selection (BVS) approach addresses these concerns and offers additional insights for eQTL studies. The paper implements a new Bayesian variable selection method for multivariate mapping of single or multiple outcomes, demonstrating the ability to identify substantially more cis- and trans-effects than commonly used single marker eQTL methods for the same FDR level and enabling efficient identification of genetic regulation across multiple tissue types.
A mathematical model of proteins regulating extrinsic apoptosis was constructed using mass-action kinetics, with reactions represented as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model, named EARM v1.0, contains 58 species, 40 additional species, 28 reactions, and 70 nonzero rate constants. EARM v1.0 consists of four subcircuits, including a lumped-parameter representation of receptor binding by TNF or TRAIL, an enzyme cascade, a mitochondrial feed-forward pathway, and a positive feedback loop. Simplifications were made to reduce the number of species and free parameters. Experiments using HeLa cells exposed to TRAIL revealed a variable-delay, snap-action switching behavior in which C3* activity remained low for a period before rapidly rising to a plateau, leading to cell death. Flow cytometry data showed that TRAIL treatment led to a bimodal distribution of cPARP signals, reflecting rapid and complete PARP cleavage at the single-cell level. Simulation of experimental procedures revealed that varying the mean values of Ts, Td, or f in the synthetic trajectories allowed for the quantification of mean and variance of Ts, Td, and f. When experimental live-cell, flow cytometry, and immunoblot data from HeLa cells exposed to TRAIL were merged, excellent quantitative agreement in death dynamics was observed. Quantitative models of apoptosis must account for the overall efficiency, dose-dependence, length of Td, rapidity of Ts, and the independence of Ts and Td. EARM v1.0 was adjusted to minimize the difference between simulated trajectories and experimental data, demonstrating that efficient snap-action cleavage of effector caspase substrates absolutely requires the mitochondrial feed-forward pathway. In summary, the EARM v1.0 model provides a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of extrinsic apoptosis and has important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity.
During pregnancy, the placenta protects the fetus from the mother's immune response and pathogens. However, some bacterial pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes have evolved mechanisms to breach this barrier. The protein InlP, secreted by L. monocytogenes, specifically binds to human afadin, a protein associated with cell-cell junctions. The binding of InlP to afadin allows L. monocytogenes to exert traction stresses on deformable substrates and form actin-rich protrusions from the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers. This process is necessary for the bacterium to cross such monolayers and reach the fetal side of the placenta. InlP's interaction with afadin is crucial for this transcytosis, as mutants lacking InlP or with a specific in-frame deletion in inlP show a decrease in transcytosis. Afadin deletion in the host cells does not rescue the transcytosis defect, indicating that InlP targets cytosolic afadin specifically to promote L. monocytogenes transcytosis. Understanding the mechanisms behind the feto-maternal barrier's protection and how pathogens like L. monocytogenes breach it is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent and treat infections during pregnancy.
Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, is a chronic multistage disease with an estimated 8 million new cases per year. A study was conducted to investigate the T. pallidum proteome profile during infection using complementary mass spectrometry techniques, including multidimensional peptide separation and protein identification via MALDI-TOF/TOF and ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. The study identified a total of 6033 peptides, corresponding to 557 unique T. pallidum proteins at a high level of confidence, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date, providing valuable insights into in vivo T. pallidum protein expression and paving the way for improved understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism. The study found that a low correlation (r = 0.26) was found between previous microarray signal data and protein abundance, highlighting the need for further study in this area.
"Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a major receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes. The cAMP binds to two tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and -B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (R), releasing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). While CBD-A in RIα is required for PKA inhibition and activation, CBD-B functions as a ""gatekeeper"" domain that modulates the control exerted by CBD-A. Preliminary evidence suggests that CBD-B dynamics are critical for its gatekeeper function. A study using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) investigated the two-domain construct RIα (91–379) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms. The results support a double conformational selection model in which each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD within a nearly degenerate free energy landscape. Binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, as it selectively stabilizes the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts. The inter-CBD interface is indispensable for full activation of PKA as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. The two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles, supporting the notion that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics. PKA is a major receptor for cAMP, and in higher eukaryotes, it is utilized by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli to control intra-cellular responses such as regulation of the immune system and cell proliferation."
The study of the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) reveals that it encodes one of the most abundant proteins induced by IFN, and its expression is associated with antiviral immunity. The proteomes of ISG15-/- and ISG15+/+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were compared after vaccinia virus (VACV) infection, and the results showed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were pathways altered in ISG15-/- BMDM treated with IFN. ISG15-dependent mechanisms regulate mitochondrial respiration, ATP, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ISG15 depletion results in a significant change in macrophage polarization, with infected ISG15-/- macrophages showing a robust proinflammatory cytokine expression pattern typical of an M1 phenotype, but a clear blockade of nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase-1 activation. Following IFN treatment, NO release is higher in ISG15+/+ macrophages than in ISG15-/- macrophages, concomitant with a decrease in viral titer. ISG15-/- macrophages are permissive for VACV replication following IFN treatment. ISG15 governs the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, specifically, OXPHOS and mitophagy, broadening its physiological role as an antiviral agent. ISG15 is an IFN α/β-induced ubiquitin-like protein that exists in two distinct states, as a free molecule or conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins. ISGylation has been shown to occur in a cotranslational process favoring modification of viral proteins in infected cells, which in turn obstructs virus assembly or function. ISG15 expression has been shown to disrupt the process of virus-budding via different mechanisms. ISG15 has essential immune functions, but not in antiviral immunity in humans. ISG15 has been shown to play an important role in vaccinia virus (VACV) infection and the regulation of macrophage responses. ISG15-/- macrophages display reduced activation, phagocytic capacity, and programmed cell death in response to VACV infection.
The Vpu protein of HIV-1 has two functions in the replication of the virus: degrading its cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing viral particle release. Vpu undergoes phosphorylation at the serine 61 (S61) residue, which is adjacent to the βTrCP-binding motif. This phosphorylation event triggers Vpu degradation by a βTrCP-independent process. The degradation of Vpu decreases the efficiency of Vpu-mediated release of HIV-1 virions. The controlled degradation of Vpu may contribute to the balance between efficient HIV-1 dissemination and preservation of the reservoir of infected cells. Vpu differentially affects βTrCP-mediated degradation events, which occur at different phases of the cell cycle. The amount of Vpu varies depending on cycle progression, and its expression is reduced in nocodazole-treated cells. Inhibition of proteasome activity by MG132 strongly increases the amount of Vpu in nocodazole-treated cells. The pools of wild-type and mutant Vpu are decreased to a similar extent by nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest, suggesting that βTrCP is not responsible for Vpu degradation. The reduction of Vpu expression in nocodazole-treated cells is due to a mitotic arrest rather than an indirect effect induced by microtubules or Golgi-targeting drugs. A new phosphorylation event of Vpu takes place in mitosis, and substitution of serine 61 into alanine within the Vpu2/6 mutant precludes the appearance of the slow migrating form seen in nocodazole-treated cells. Vpu phosphorylation on serine 61 provides the signal that triggers Vpu degradation in mitotic cells. The Vpu S61A mutant strongly accumulates in cells and coimmunoprecipitates very efficiently with endogenous βTrCP, and accordingly, strongly stabilizes β-catenin. Introduction of Vpu S61Q mutation in the NL4–3 provirus extends the half-life of the Vpu protein, and Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation is not affected by mutation of Vpu serine 61. HIV-1 encoding the S61 Vpu mutant is released much more abundantly from HeLa cells than the wild-type virus. The Vpu S61 mutation does not affect the infectivity of the viral particles. Vpu degradation occurs via a βTrCP-independent pathway and is triggered by phosphorylation of the S61 residue. The regulated degradation process of Vpu predominantly occurs in early mitosis, and the phosphorylation of Vpu serine 61 is the triggering event for subsequent Vpu degradation.
The researchers developed two hypotheses to explain how tissue patterning is coordinated with whole-body development to ensure proper tissue development under various conditions. The first hypothesis is that tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time, while the second hypothesis is that tissue patterning aligns at developmental milestones. To distinguish between these hypotheses, the researchers studied the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae, using a staging scheme based on the expression of canonical patterning genes, which they linked to three whole-body developmental events: moult, larval wandering, and pupariation. They found that the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moult and pupariation, indicating that these key developmental events represent milestones. However, between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. The data also showed that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage, suggesting that wandering is not a developmental milestone. These findings suggest that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. This work provides important insights into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole.
In fungal hyphae, early endosomes are crucial for both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargoes, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the interplay between these seemingly distinct trafficking processes is not well understood. This study reveals that the ESCRT regulator, Did2, coordinates endosomal transport in Ustilago maydis fungal hyphae. Loss of Did2 leads to defects in vacuolar targeting, less processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. Late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, indicating defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, resulting in disturbed processive movement, and the endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 is hardly present on endosomes, leading to defects in long-distance mRNA transport. Therefore, the ESCRT regulator Did2 coordinates precise maturation of endosomes, providing the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. Endocytosis is a fundamental mechanism in eukaryotic cells, required for regulating important cellular processes such as establishing cell polarity at the plasma membrane. After internalization, membrane proteins are sorted into early endosomes, which mature to late endosomes before being targeted to the lysosome/vacuole. Essential components of endosomal maturation include the ESCRT complex, a highly conserved multi-protein complex. The ESCRT machinery plays a crucial role in membrane remodelling, forming intraluminal vesicles within endosomes and sorting endocytosed transmembrane proteins for degradation in the lysosome/vacuole.
Riboswitches are genetic elements that regulate gene expression in bacteria and other organisms by binding specific ligands, leading to changes in conformation that affect transcription or translation. The adenine riboswitches of Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnificus provide an example of this regulation, but with important differences. The B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch controls transcription and requires co-transcriptional binding of adenine, while the V. vulnificus add riboswitch controls translation and can bind adenine after transcription is completed. The pbuE riboswitch functions through a kinetic regime, with regulation dependent on the rate of transcription, while the add riboswitch operates under a thermodynamic regime. These differences highlight the importance of the nature of gene regulation control in riboswitch regulatory mechanisms, and the crucial role of transcription in riboswitch regulation. While many genetic expression studies have historically focused on transcriptional regulation, recent research has shown the importance of post-transcriptional regulation and riboswitches. Riboswitches are cellular sensors that modulate gene expression through various factors, such as temperature, small metabolites, and uncharged tRNAs, and can regulate transcription, translation, mRNA processing and mRNA splicing. They are composed of two modular domains, an aptamer involved in ligand binding and an expression platform that modulates gene expression. Despite their important differences, the pbuE and add adenine riboswitches bind the same ligand but employ different regulation mechanisms to positively modulate gene expression. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of these and other riboswitch representatives will provide valuable insights into the intricacies of riboswitch regulation.
In both Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae, transcription initiation involving a 2-4 nt oligoribonucleotide primer, known as primer-dependent initiation (PDI), is a widely prevalent mechanism for gene expression during the stationary phase of growth. A recent study has established a physiological role for PDI in E. coli as a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation. The study also demonstrated, using high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5′ ends (5′ RNA-seq), that PDI occurs in V. cholerae and follows a pattern similar to that in E. coli. In particular, PDI is preferentially apparent at promoters carrying the sequence T-1A+1 or G-1G+1, and its occurrence is growth phase-dependent. The PDI-dependent increase in bhsA expression that occurs during stationary phase in E. coli contributes to biofilm formation, revealing a specific role for PDI as a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm growth. The study also found that a more sensitive 5′ RNA-seq protocol identified the occurrence of PDI in V. cholerae, with a pattern similar to that in E. coli. The findings highlight the importance of PDI in the regulation of gene expression and cell physiology in both E. coli and V. cholerae.
In both mammals and plants, an imbalance in parental genome dosage can disrupt embryo growth and may contribute to reproductive isolation between emerging new species. Increased dosage of maternal genomes represses growth, while an increased dosage of paternal genomes has the opposite effect. This phenomenon is linked to the expression of imprinted genes, which are activated by a single parental allele. A parental conflict theory proposes that imprinted genes encoding maternal growth inhibitors and paternal growth enhancers directly mirror parental genome imbalances. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. In Arabidopsis, genome dosage imbalance deregulates the expression of imprinted genes FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA), as well as MEDEA (MEA) and PHERES1 (PHE1). These genes are controlled by DNA methylation and histone methylation, respectively. The changes in PHE1 and MEA expression cannot be fully accounted for by fluctuations in FIS2 expression, indicating that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting using mechanisms independent from known regulators of imprinting. Overall, the complexity of the network of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes activated in response to parental dosage imbalance does not support simple models derived from the parental conflict hypothesis. Increased maternal dosage is expected to increase the level of expression of the active maternal allele of FIS2 and FWA, while the global level of expression of these genes should not be affected by an increased dosage of inactive paternal alleles. However, measurements of the expression of FIS2, a maternally expressed imprinted gene silenced by DNA methylation, indicate that parental genome dosage imbalance did not affect transcription globally and did not affect regulators of DNA methylation, which control imprinting. The expression of these two genes is also not imprinted. The experiments showed that parental genome dosage imbalance down-regulates FIS2 expression irrespective of its genomic context. Increased paternal genome dosage down-regulates FIS2 expression likely through a distinct mechanism, possibly due to an increased paternal dosage of a paternally expressed imprinted inhibitor of FIS2 or from the activity of yet unidentified cis-elements. Loss of FIS2 imprinting was not restricted to RLD 2n X Col 4n crosses, indicating that increased paternal dosage decreases the overall expression of FIS2 while both parental alleles become expressed. Such rather paradoxical effect is difficult to interpret. Parental genome dosage imbalance perturbs imprinting through interactions between imprinted genes and other unidentified regulators. At least two out of four genes studied, MEA and FIS2, lost imprinting as a result of dosage imbalance, indicating that increasing the dosage of the silenced allele of an imprinted gene causes the removal of the imprinting marks on the silenced allele.
"A study discussed in the text has developed a method to reverse-engineer network architectures, or ""virtual brains,"" based on EEG/MEG recordings of neural activity. These recordings typically exhibit oscillations of specific frequencies over a non-oscillatory background, which appear as evenly spaced frequency bands on a logarithmic scale. The researchers used mathematical techniques to reconstruct network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves. They found that all reconstructed networks, including those modeled after diseased brains, display similar topological features and dynamics. The complexity of the network was found to be a good indicator of brain fitness, with virtual brains modeling diseased states displaying lower complexity than those modeling normal neural function. This approach has the potential to provide insights into the neurobiology of health and disease."
The study analyzes the population structure of 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, using 60,000 SNPs selected for minimal linkage disequilibrium. The analysis reveals four genetic subgroups that align with self-identified heritage, primarily representing Central/South America, the Dominican Republic and Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The first two principal components (PCs) of ancestry display strong population stratification across the Hispanic cohort, with the first PC separating individuals of Mexican versus Caribbean origin and the second PC reflecting admixture of Caucasian and African ancestry. The third and fourth PCs further separate Puerto Rican and Central/South American subjects into two distinct groups, with the population structure aligning with a South-to-North geographic location of Native American samples. The study also performs genetic association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions, previously reported in GWAS of triglycerides in Caucasians but unconfirmed in Hispanic populations. The analysis provides statistically significant evidence for genetic association and demonstrates the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies performed in the United States Hispanic population.
The Elongator complex, involved in transcription elongation and modification of tRNAs, has been found to have a role in transcriptional silencing, genome stability, and DNA repair. Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, is required for silencing of reporter genes at the chromosome VIIL telomere and at the HMR locus, and cells lacking Elp3 are sensitive to DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and the damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Elp3 is also required for S-phase progression in the presence of HU. Epistatic analysis shows that the elp3Δ mutant exacerbates the MMS sensitivity of cells lacking histone chaperones Asf1, CAF-1 and the H3 lysine 56 acetyltransferase Rtt109. The Elongator complex interacts with the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA, and PCNA binds to the Elongator complex both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest a novel role for the intact Elongator complex in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability, and it does so in a pathway linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA. Chromatin, an organized complex of proteins and DNA in eukaryotic cells, is regulated by diverse means to govern cellular processes including gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. Histones that form the core components of nucleosomes are modified post-translationally by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Distinct modifications of histones can either alter chromatin structure and/or recruit proteins to chromatin to impact a specific cellular process. Histone chaperones facilitate DNA replication and gene transcription processes by binding to histones for nucleosome assembly and/or disassembly. Chromatin can be remodeled by ATP dependent chromatin remodeling machines. Emerging evidence suggests that histone modifications, nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling coordinate to regulate chromatin structures during gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair and other cellular processes.
A knowledge-based service providing highly precise and organized biomedical information requires the manual curation of relevant publications, which is usually done through a query-based process called document triage. However, this method often has unsatisfactory precision and recall, and manually generating optimal queries is difficult. A machine-learning assisted triage method has been proposed to address this issue. This method uses deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks, trained on previously curated publications from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, to classify and rank new publications for curation. This machine-assisted triage method outperforms current query-based triage methods, improving efficiency and enriching curated content. It achieved a precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than that obtained by the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. This method allows human curators to focus on more challenging tasks, improving the quality of knowledge bases.
The KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels, which are strongly expressed in both atria and ventricles, are responsible for the cardiac inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), which stabilizes the resting membrane potential and contributes to the terminal repolarization of both atrial and ventricular action potentials. Loss-of-function of Kir2.1 channels has been implicated in the Andersen-Tawil syndrome, while gain-of-function KCNJ2 mutations are potentially life-threatening, underlying variant 3 of the short QT syndrome (SQT3) and familial atrial fibrillation (AF). SQT3 is characterized by an abbreviated QT interval, tall and peaked T waves, and loss of rate-adaptation of the QT interval, and has been associated with increased risk of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias and of sudden cardiac death. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the influence of the SQT3 D172N and E299V Kir2.1 mutations on atrial repolarisation and susceptibility to re-entrant excitation, using heterogeneous, multi-scale models of human atrial electrophysiology. The study found that the D172N and E299V mutations produced distinct effects on IK1 and APD shortening, decreased wavelength of re-entry (WL) for re-entry through a reduction in ERP and CV, and altered stability of re-entrant excitation waves in 2D and 3D tissue models. Combined block of IK1 and IKr was effective in terminating re-entry associated with heterozygous D172N conditions, whereas IKr block alone may be a safer alternative for the E299V mutation. Combined inhibition of IKr and IKur produced a synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both forms of SQT3. The study provides mechanistic insights into atrial proarrhythmia with SQT3 Kir2.1 mutations and highlights possible pharmacological strategies for management of SQT3-linked AF.
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a complex systemic disease endemic in Central and South America, with an estimated 7.7 million infected individuals in 2005. However, 20% of the Latin American population is still at risk of infection, and there are 300,000 infected individuals living in the United States. The disease is classically transmitted by hematophagous triatomine insects, but vector-independent forms of transmission such as blood transfusions, organ transplantation, ingestion of contaminated food or drinks, and congenital transmission are becoming more common, particularly in developed countries. Chronic infection with T. cruzi can lead to three symptomatic forms: cardiac, digestive, or cardiodigestive, with the cardiac form being the most severe and frequent, affecting 20-30% of infected individuals. In a recent study, researchers aimed to investigate if adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) could alter the course of Chagas disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection, and the results showed that ASC injection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, which was followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 dpi. At the same time point, analyses of cytokine release in cells isolated from the heart and exposed to T. cruzi antigens indicated an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals. The study suggests that the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents right ventricular remodeling through the modulation of immune responses, thus promoting a lymphoid organ response to the parasite that promotes the control of parasite burden while protecting the heart from damage due to improved control of inflammation in ASC-treated mice.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites that reside in specialized compartments in mammalian cells called parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs). These LPVs share characteristics with late endocytic pathway compartments, including acidification and the presence of molecules such as LAMP1 and cathepsins. However, there are still many uncertainties about the composition of LPVs. Some studies have shown that molecules typically found in secretory pathway compartments, such as calnexin and SNAREs, are also present on LPVs and are functionally relevant to their biogenesis.A small molecule called Retro-2cycl, which disrupts the retrograde transport machinery in mammalian cells, has been shown to block retrograde transport-dependent phenomena, such as polyomavirus cellular infection and Shiga toxin trafficking in cells. Retro-2cycl and its analogs, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, have been found to limit Leishmania amazonensis infection in macrophages at lower concentrations than Retro-2cycl. These analogs have also been shown to reverse Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation and to kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures, which is a desirable attribute for any drug to treat Leishmania infections. These studies validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl and suggest that pharmacological intervention in protein transport could be a viable strategy for the treatment of Leishmania.
The nucleosome, the fundamental unit of genomic organization, is believed to play a central role in regulating gene transcription in eukaryotic cells. It is comprised of an octameric protein core wrapped by ~147 bp of DNA. Nucleosomes can be positioned either statistically or specifically within the genome, influenced by factors such as chromatin remodeling enzymes or the basal affinity of DNA for a nucleosome. A study by Whitehouse et al. used a computational method to evaluate the nucleosome sensitivity for a transcription factor over a given stretch of the genome, focusing on the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a (AML-1a) transcription factor. AML-1a, a regulator of immune gene expression, was identified as potentially sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the mouse Ly49 gene family.The Ly49 genes, which encode receptors on natural killer (NK) and other immune cells, are of interest due to their stochastic expression and the role they play in distinguishing healthy cells from cancer or virus-infected cells. By analyzing MNase-Seq data from RMA cells, which naturally express only Ly49A, the researchers found a specific depletion of nucleosomes at AML-1a binding sites in the expressed Ly49A when compared to the other, silent Ly49 genes. This suggests that nucleosome-based regulation contributes to the expression of Ly49 genes.This method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity could aid in dissecting the regulatory role of nucleosomes in general, as understanding the complex regulatory network of histone modifications and nucleosome steric effects on DNA accessibility is essential for comprehending gene expression regulation. The researchers propose that certain necessary transcription factor binding sites within the Ly49 promoters or the enhancer may be sensitive to the steric effects of nucleosome coverage, leading to variations in Ly49 expression. The study of nucleosome positioning and its interaction with transcription factor binding sites in the Ly49 gene family provides valuable insights into transcriptional regulation by nucleosomes.
The cell cycle and genome duplication are regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), with CDK activation depending on phosphorylation of their T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the only known CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. However, the critical activation step for CDK2 and CDK1 is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc25 phosphatases rather than unrestricted T-loop phosphorylation. CDK4 and CDK6, activated by D-type cyclins, are master integrators of mitogenic/oncogenic signaling cascades and are crucial for various oncogenic transformation processes. A CDK4/6 inhibitor is being tested in clinical trials for various chemotherapy-resistant cancers. CDK4/6 activity is deregulated in many human tumors, and specific CDK7 inhibition has been shown to reveal a crucial but partly indirect CDK7 involvement in phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6, the existence of CDK4-activating kinase(s) other than CDK7, and novel CDK7-dependent positive feedbacks mediated by p21 phosphorylation to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage. CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promise in preclinical models and in patients, and further research is needed to fully understand the complex regulation of CDK4/6 activation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
DUET, a PHD finger protein in Arabidopsis, plays a crucial role in male meiosis. It is specifically expressed during the diplotene stage of meiosis and localizes to euchromatin, where it binds H3K4me2 but not H3K9me2. The mutation of DUET results in cytoplasmic collapse of meiocytes, delayed progression, formation of dyads and triads, absence of pollen, and cytokinesis, chromosome segregation, and cell cycle regulation defects during meiosis II. The DUET PHD finger specifically binds H3K4me2, and this interaction is critical for its function. In meiosis II, DUET is required for cellular organization, microtubule organization, and chromatid segregation. DUET affects gene expression, and its expression is specifically required for JAS expression, which plays a role in meiosis II spindle organization. Additionally, DUET is required for TDM1 expression, which is involved in meiotic cell cycle transitions. Overall, DUET is a transcriptional regulator that plays a critical role during male meiosis in plants.
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting male premutation carriers of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which has a trinucleotide repeat expansion of CGG in the 5' untranslated region. Previous studies found that Fragile X rCGG repeats can cause neurodegeneration and that the rCGG repeat-binding proteins Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1 can modulate rCGG-mediated neuronal toxicity. A recent study aimed to explore the role of Pur α further in rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration using a proteomic approach and identified more than 100 proteins that interact with Pur α. Of particular interest is Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase, which could modulate rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration. The study found that rCGG repeats decreased the expression of Rm62 posttranscriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. These findings suggest that abnormal nuclear accumulation of these mRNAs, likely as a result of impaired nuclear export, could contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a paradigm organism for the study of biofilms, forms environmentally and clinically relevant biofilms that are matrix-encased communities of bacteria. The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of P. aeruginosa biofilms is a mix of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins, with the Psl exopolysaccharide being required for bacterial cells to adhere to a substratum and maintain biofilm structure. Psl appears to be composed of mannose, galactose, rhamnose, glucose, and trace amounts of xylose, although its precise biochemical structure has not been determined. A thorough understanding of the biofilm matrix ultra-structure is critical for the rational design of inhibitors that could prevent the numerous clinical and environmental complications associated with biofilms. In a study, Psl-specific lectin staining followed by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualize Psl on the surface of cells and within the EPS matrix. The results show a helical pattern of Psl staining on the bacterial cell surface at the biofilm initiation stage, which is essential for formation of the Psl matrix and the initiation of a biofilm. The Psl matrix was visualized in real time during a biofilm developmental cycle, revealing how the matrix forms and encases the bacterial cells in the biofilm and on a surface and how the matrix changes structure to maintain biofilm architecture during development. Using double staining methodologies, it was shown that the eDNA and Psl matrices do not overlap, but appear to coordinate activities to maintain the biofilm structure. It was proposed that, like higher organisms, P. aeruginosa can utilize programmed cell death and autolysis to degrade the Psl matrix in the center of microcolonies to free ‘the seeds of biofilm’ for future dispersal. Cellulase, which targets β-1, 3 or β-1, 4-linked glucans, can free Psl from the bacterial cell surface without degrading the major Psl polymer and cellulase-digested Psl is able to adhere with a substratum. This data suggests that β-1, 3 or β-1, 4-linked glucose may be the monosaccharide that links Psl to the bacterial surface. Cellulase treatment dramatically reduces biofilm development under flow conditions, indicating that the surface association of Psl is essential for P. aeruginosa to initiate a biofilm.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) are promising preclinical models for PDAC, offering the potential to recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. However, a comprehensive assessment of the molecular heterogeneity of PDX and PDO models and their comparison with matched human tumors at the whole genome level has not been thoroughly addressed.To address this, a study conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumors and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of matched primary tumor, PDX, and PDO. The study developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumors for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations (SV), and copy number variations (CNV). The results showed that tumor-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. However, polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes, and ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs.In conclusion, while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity. Overall, the findings indicate that PDX and PDO successfully recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at the level of simple somatic mutations mainly in driver genes, but not across the greater expanse of annotated mutations. Disease model fidelity is not readily retained when assessing structural variation (SV) events, but clustering of large SV events across particular chromosomes of the tumors is retained in matching disease models. The work demonstrates stable consistency of ploidy-corrected copy number states between donor-model pairs, but underscores a major concern regarding ploidy changes when tumors are implanted into their respective models.
A large genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in East Asian women to identify novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. The study included 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. After analyzing 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, the study evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls, and further evaluated the top 22 SNPs in up to 17,423 additional subjects. The study found strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene in chromosome 6q25.1, represented by rs9485372, which was associated with breast cancer risk with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. The study also identified two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively. These findings provide important insights into the genetic factors that contribute to breast cancer risk in East Asian women.
Cryptococcal meningitis, caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), is a significant cause of mortality in HIV-positive patients, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. A study of 230 Cn isolates from HIV-positive South African clinical trial patients found high levels of genetic diversity and 50 sequence types, with 72% of isolates typed as one of seven 'high frequency' genotypes. Spatial analysis showed no clustering, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent local acquisition. Patients infected with the VNB lineage had significantly worse survival, and this was maintained even after adjustment for known prognostic indicators. Comparison of fungal genotype with in vitro phenotype revealed evidence of lineage-associated virulence phenotype. The findings highlight the importance of lineage in cryptococcal virulence during human infection and the need for further investigation into how genetic diversity is structured across African environments.
In order to understand how signal transduction pathways evolve, researchers constructed an overexpression library of transcription factors in Candida albicans, a human fungal pathogen. They identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of a newly evolved signal transduction pathway that regulates the pheromone response of the white cell phenotype. This pathway appears to have been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans. The upstream portion, including signals, receptors, the trimeric G protein complex, and the MAP kinase cascade, was derived from the upstream portion of the opaque pheromone response pathway of the mating process. Tec1, the transcription factor targeted by the MAP kinase pathway, was derived from a filamentation pathway, and the white-specific downstream target genes were derived from an ancestral biofilm process. This finding provides a possible paradigm for how some signal transduction pathways evolve.
The genomic GC-content of bacteria varies dramatically, which is generally attributed to differences in the pattern of mutation between bacteria. However, a study examining patterns of synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species found a large excess of synonymous GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations segregating in all but the most AT-rich bacteria. This excess of GC→AT mutations is inconsistent with mutation bias and is likely due to selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Therefore, there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria. This variation in base composition is not restricted to particular groups of bacteria and is associated with several factors including genome size, free-living or not, environment, aerobiosis, nitrogen utilization, and temperature. However, it is still unknown whether these correlations are due to the influence of these factors on the process of mutation or natural selection. In some bacteria, there is evidence that the genomic GC-content is not a simple consequence of mutation bias, as functional constraints and natural selection are involved. Overall, the study suggests that mutation bias, translational selection, and biased gene conversion alone cannot explain the patterns of genomic GC-content in bacteria and that other factors, such as natural selection and functional constraints, play a significant role.
A new approach for mapping the observed prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) was developed and applied to Kenya in 2009. Observed prevalence data for hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura were collected from 945 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1974 and 2009. Ecological and climatic covariates were extracted from high-resolution satellite data and used to develop Bayesian space-time geostatistical models for each species. These models were then used to interpolate the probability that infection prevalence exceeded the 20% threshold across the country for both 1989 and 2009. The maps for each species were integrated to estimate the combined STH prevalence using the law of total probability. The model estimated that a total of 2.8 million school-aged children live in districts which warrant mass treatment. The study demonstrates that Bayesian space-time geostatistical models can be used to reliably estimate the combined observed prevalence of STH and suggest that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas of high prevalence and warrant mass treatment. As control is successful in reducing infection levels, updated models can be used to refine decision-making in helminth control.
The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) requires a coordinated effort between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, resulting in a type 1 cytokine response, which is associated with control of infection. The role of innate lymphocytes in this process is debated, but recent research has shed light on the importance of CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells in immunity against Mtb. These cells, even in limited quantities, are sufficient to restrict Mtb replication both in vitro and in vivo, and they directly kill Mtb through a mechanism that is dependent on CD1d expression by infected macrophages as well as IL-12 and IL-18. Additionally, primary splenic iNKT cells obtained from uninfected mice significantly reduce the bacterial burden in the lungs of mice infected with virulent Mtb by the aerosol route. This is the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo. This discovery highlights the important role of innate lymphocytes in immunity against Mtb, and suggests that targeting iNKT cells may be a promising strategy for the development of new tuberculosis treatments.
"In this text, protein assemblies are discussed, which can be stabilized by covalent bonds with transglutaminases (TGases) playing a crucial role in creating these bonds. An example is provided of the transglutaminase Tgl found in the protein coat of Bacillus subtilis endospores. Unlike other TGases, Tgl is produced in an active form and catalyzes amine incorporation and protein cross-linking with no known additional requirements. However, the activity of Tgl needs to be controlled during spore coat assembly, and it is shown that substrates assembled onto the spore coat prior to Tgl production govern the localization of Tgl to the surface of the developing spore. The glutamyl (Q) and lysil (K) substrate docking sites have been identified, and it is shown that residues on the Q side of Tgl are more important for the assembly of Tgl than those on the K side. This suggests that the first step in the reaction cycle, the interaction with Q-substrates and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, is also the determinant step in the localization of Tgl. To accurately control the time, location and extent of the enzyme's activity, it is suggested that Tgl's dependency on its substrates is crucial, ensuring covalent fortification of pre-assembled complexes at the surface of the developing spore. Protein function is often restricted to specific cellular locations, and knowledge of the pathways governing protein localization is essential to understand protein function. Protein assemblies are formed through non-covalent interactions or covalent bonds catalyzed by enzymes such as TGases. TGases are involved in various processes, including blood clotting, organization of the extracellular matrix, tissue and bone mineralization, cell adhesion, stabilization of dermo-epidermal junctions, or the cross-linking of eye lens proteins. The activity of TGases is tightly controlled, as illustrated by human factor XIIIa (FXIIIa), a TGase responsible for the cross-linking of fibrin in the last stages of the blood coagulation cascade. FXIII activation is elicited by thrombin processing and dissociation of the B2 subunits, and FXIII activation is essential for haemostasis, a process referred to as ""spotwelding"". In the case of Bacillus subtilis endospores, Tgl cross-links and thereby stabilizes the fibrin polymer, ensuring proper localization of the enzyme for the formation of the blood clot."
Opisthorchis viverrini is a food-borne trematode species that can cause biliary diseases and fatal cholangiocarcinoma. In Lao PDR, an estimated 2.5 million people are infected with O. viverrini, but epidemiological studies are limited and the spatial distribution of infection is unclear. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Champasack province to map the distribution of O. viverrini, identify risk factors, and predict prevalence at non-surveyed locations. The survey found that 61.1% of 3,371 participants were infected with O. viverrini. Risk factors for infection included age, Lao Loum ethnic group, low educational attainment, occupation as a rice farmer, fisherman, or animal breeder, and unsafe drinking water sources. Protective factors included history of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance from freshwater bodies. Spatial patterns of infection were mainly governed by environmental factors, and the study identified two different risk profiles: low risk in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor. These findings are important for spatial targeting of control efforts and suggest that infection with O. viverrini is strongly associated with exposure to the second intermediate host fish, human behavior and culture, and lack of sanitation.
Dar es Salaam, the largest city and de facto capital of Tanzania, has an extensive drain network that is mostly inadequate, with many drains blocked by waste and associated with the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria. A study was conducted to determine the importance of drains as breeding habitats for vectors of these diseases. The study found that more than 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam were human-made, and drains were the most common type of habitat, making up 42%. The study also found that aquatic habitats associated with agriculture had the highest proportion of Anopheles larvae presence and the second highest of Culex larvae presence. However, the majority of aquatic habitats were drains, and therefore, a significant number of positive habitats for both Anopheles and Culex larvae were drains. The study suggests that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential to eliminate over 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats currently treated with larvicides. The importance of human-made larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors underscores the need for a synergy between ongoing control efforts of these diseases.
Dengue is a significant public health issue in tropical regions, with 3.6 billion people at risk and 390 million infections per year. The Dengue virus (DENV) consists of a single positive-sense RNA genome encoding 10 viral proteins, with cellular lipids playing crucial roles in several steps of the DENV replicative cycle. DENV infection increases intracellular cholesterol levels by triggering LDL particles uptake and decreasing HMGCR phosphorylation, leading to improved enzymatic activity. This dephosphorylation of HMGCR may be an important step for the DENV replication cycle. AMPK, regulated through phosphorylation in threonine 172, affects intracellular lipid content mainly by modulating free fatty acids and cholesterol synthesis through direct phosphorylation of rate-limiting enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and HMGCR. DENV negatively regulates AMPK activity at 24 hpi, driving an increase of HMGCR activity and cholesterol accumulation at replication sites. Pharmacological activation of AMPK produces a significant, dose-dependent anti-DENV effect. DENV infection decreases AMPK activity, and the activation of AMPK induces a strong anti-DENV effect, reducing the NS3 levels. HMGCR is an ER-resident protein, and its raised activity during DENV infection is mediated by down-modulation of AMPK. Replication complexes, identified by NS4A protein immunoreactivity, show a correlation between NS4 and HMGCR distribution patterns, suggesting both proteins are present in a close proximity. HMGCR co-localizes with NS4A in DENV’s replication complexes. AMPK activation reduces HMGCR protein levels, while replication complexes need HMGCR activation for their formation. The reduction of viral proteins observed in response to the treatment with MET and lovastatin was corroborated, promoting a decrease of NS4A and NS3 proteins levels. DENV infection could lead to accumulation of intracellular cholesterol through HMGCR activation in order to encourage the formation and maintenance of DENV-replicative complexes. In DENV infected cells, cholesterol accumulates in DENV-replication complexes, and this accumulation is reduced when cells are treated with an AMPK activator or a HMGCR competitive inhibitor.
The function and dynamics of biomolecular assemblies, which are composed of proteins, RNA, and other cofactors, are determined by their energy landscapes. These energy landscapes can be quantified and manipulated to precisely control the biological dynamics of the assemblies. However, most experimental techniques only report on the rates of interconversion between states, which are discretized approximations of the energetic basins. To bridge the gap between discrete and continuous descriptions of a molecular machine like the ribosome, it is necessary to quantify the diffusive properties of functionally-relevant collective rearrangements. This can be done by measuring the effective diffusion, which is determined by the intrinsic diffusion of the component and the short-scale energetic roughness introduced by molecular interfaces. Structural rearrangements can then be described by effective diffusion on a smooth, large-scale energy landscape. This approach was used to study the translocation of tRNA in the ribosome using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and energy landscape theory. The results provide a quantitative description of the energy landscape of translocation and the relationship between the long length-scale free-energy barriers and the kinetics associated with interconversion between well-defined states. This framework can be applied to any number of intermediates and transition states in the kinetic scheme of translocation.
Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare, calcitonin-secreting tumor derived from para-follicular C cells, with up to 75% of cases being sporadic and 25% being hereditary. While RET and RAS mutations are commonly implicated in MTC, the genetic landscape of MTC is not fully understood, and the potential role of other genetic mutations in MTC remains unclear. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to examine the genetic profiles of MTC and detect ALK rearrangements. The study included 84 MTC samples, 36 of which were paired with normal thyroid tissues. Of these, 47 cases had RET mutations, 14 had HRAS mutations, and 11 had STK11 mutations. Two cases had ALK rearrangements, one with an EML4-ALK fusion and the other with a novel GFPT1-ALK fusion. The EML4-ALK fusion case showed a dramatic response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, indicating that this fusion may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. The GFPT1-ALK fusion may also be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy, although further research is needed to validate its oncogenic role in MTC. This study highlights the potential of NGS for identifying target genes in rare diseases, and the need for more efficient strategies to detect ALK rearrangements. Despite the low frequency of ALK rearrangements in MTC, the detection of these fusions has significant implications for the development of targeted therapies for MTC.
In an effort to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in three adjoining Asian countries, it is crucial to address the challenge of asymptomatic leishmaniasis, which can drive the epidemic and transform into symptomatic VL or Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL). A study in eight tribal villages of Malda district, West Bengal, India, found that out of 2603 screened individuals, 185 tested positive for antileishmanial antibodies, with 96 having a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such history. Seventy-nine individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis, and among them, 8/77 (10.39%) developed disease and 62/77 (80.52%) became sero-negative during the three-year follow-up. However, 7 (9.09%) remained sero-positive even after three years. These findings highlight the importance of addressing asymptomatic leishmaniasis in the VL elimination program in the region.VL is a vector-borne protozoal disease caused by the Leishmania donovani species complex, with an estimated 200,000-400,000 new cases per year worldwide. In the Asian region, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh contribute to 67% of the total VL cases. The availability of effective drugs, indoor residual spray for vector control, and antigen-based rapid diagnostic test kits makes VL a candidate for elimination. However, the presence of asymptomatic leishmaniasis poses a significant challenge to the VL elimination initiative launched by the three countries in 2005.Asymptomatic leishmaniasis is described as a positive serological test, polymerase chain reaction, or leishmanin skin test in individuals who are apparently healthy. In endemic areas, most L. donovani infections remain asymptomatic, and asymptomatic carriers may drive the epidemic in the future. The ratio of asymptomatic infection to incident clinical VL cases varies from 1:2.4 to 5.6:1 in African countries, 18:1 to 50:1 in South American and European countries, and 3.8:1 to 8.9:1 in Asian countries. The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission and prognosis needs to be evaluated.Therefore, understanding and addressing asymptomatic leishmaniasis is crucial for the success of the VL elimination program in the three adjoining endemic countries. Long-term prospective epidemiological studies are needed to answer critical questions about asymptomatic infections, such as whether these persons are infectious to sandflies, who among the asymptomatically infected people will develop VL and when, and which infection remains asymptomatic and how long.
Aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) can lead to genetic diseases and cancer. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 on a nonessential chromosome arm led to increased genome instability due to higher rates of nonreciprocal translocations. In this study, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) was adapted to analyze a large number of these GCRs and found that the majority of translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes. Most Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, but a number were also mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements. Defects in ASF1-RTT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications, leading to aneuploidy. MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy. Genomic instability is associated with abnormal cellular growth, and genome rearrangements are associated with tumor cells and inborn genetic diseases. The pathways that suppress or enhance genome rearrangements and aneuploidy are not well understood, and quantitative genetic assays and modified versions of them are used to measure GCR rates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These assays allow for quantitative genetic analysis of the pathways that suppress or promote the formation of GCRs and the loss or gain of whole chromosomes. Various techniques have been used to analyze the structure of GCRs, but scalability remains a challenge due to high costs or tedious natures. MLPA, a multiplex ligation-dependent amplification technique, has been used to identify duplications, deletions, and aneuploidy in human cells. The study demonstrates the utility of MLPA for analyzing GCRs in S. cerevisiae and investigates the target site bias of Ty1-mediated GCRs, RAD52-independent formation of Ty1-mediated translocations, and aneuploidy induced by the deletion of RTT109.
The article discusses a docking method for protein association that is based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains. The method, called semi-definite programming-based underestimation (SDU), employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling. The algorithm was applied to docking in the rotational and translational space and showed a 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation. The method starts from a set of local minima of a funnel-like function within a given region of the search space and constructs a smooth (convex) quadratic function that underestimates the function at all local minima in the region. The underestimator is used to guide further sampling and minimize the function. The SDU algorithm has been shown to outperform CGU and a simulated annealing algorithm in finding the global minimum of a funnel-like function. The authors have developed a multistage docking method that starts with a rigid body search based on Fast Fourier Transform, selects and clusters low energy docked structures, and retains the largest clusters for further processing. The conformational space is decomposed into separate regions defined by the clusters, where free energy attraction basins are believed to exist and the free energy landscape is assumed to be funnel-like. Then SDU is called upon to locate the global minimum within each region. The method yields meaningful moves in either translational or rotational subspaces but poses a challenge in minimization in the full 6D space of rigid body motions. The authors describe two implementations of the SDU method: SDU1, a cyclic coordinate descent strategy where rotational and translational moves alternate; and SDU2, a 5D strategy in which the distance of the two proteins is separately optimized and the SDU-driven search is performed in a lower dimensional space defined by 5 angular coordinates. Results show that the methods discover broad energy funnels, generate high quality docking predictions, and produce a substantial efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods.
