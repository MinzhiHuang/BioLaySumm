       "'Acylation of diverse carbohydrates with proteins containing a membrane-bound acyltransferase-3 (AT3) domain is crucial for essential processes in bacteria, such as symbiosis, viral and antimicrobial resistance, and antibiotic biosynthesis. Evolutionary co-variance analysis was employed to construct a computational model of the structure of a bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB, revealing a unique fold for the AT3 domain with 10 transmembrane helices facilitating acetyl group transfer. AT3 domains are found in all life domains, including bacteria, where they are involved in acylating various extracytoplasmic and surface polysaccharides with significant implications in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. While mainly standalone proteins, AT3 domains can also be fused with other domains such as SGNH, highlighting their versatile functions. Key acylation processes mediated by AT3 proteins in bacteria involve O-antigen and peptidoglycan modifications that influence bacterial serotype, antibiotic resistance, bacteriophage sensitivity, and vaccine development. The prediction of the OafB structure using computational tools like RaptorX and AlphaFold underscores the stability of the model, improving understanding of AT3 domain functions and potential applications in bacterial pathogen control. The structure of AT3 proteins is highly conserved, suggesting a common mechanism for acyl group transfer, possibly involving cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA as a donor and specific residues crucial for enzymatic activity. Interactions between AT3 and SGNH domains in fusion proteins like OatA and OafB are crucial for O-acetylation processes in bacteria, highlighting the importance of these membrane-bound proteins in diverse bacterial functions. Further structural analysis of AT3 proteins emphasizes their role in bacterial adaptation, pathogenesis, and potential targets for therapeutic interventions against bacterial pathogens.'"
