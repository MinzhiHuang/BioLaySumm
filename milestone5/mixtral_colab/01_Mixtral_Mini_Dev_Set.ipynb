This means a \\u2018parent\\u2019 cell in the ovaries or testes undergoes two stages of cell division: it first divides into two cells , which then divide again to produce four \\u2018daughter\\u2019 cells . A crucial part of meiosis is ensuring that each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes that the parent cell did . Before the first round of meiosis , the chromosomes in the parent cell are copied to produce enough chromosomes for the four daughter cells . The distribution of these chromosomes between the daughter cells is determined by the opposing forces acting on them . The pairs of identical chromosomes produced during the copying process are held together by a proteinaceous glue , while microtubules attached to a structure called the spindle\\u2014which has poles at opposite ends of the cell\\u2014try to pull these pairs of chromosomes apart . Rattani et al . now show that a protein called shugoshin-like 2 ( Sgol2 ) , which is involved in holding pairs of identical chromosomes together after the first round of division , has a bigger role than was previously realised . Sgol2 performs three other functions: it helps to align the chromosomes prior to division by , it is thought , facilitating the formation of the K-fibers that attach the microtubules to the chromosomes; it turns off the checkpoint that monitors the alignment of the chromosomes and the attachment of the microtubules; and it regulates a number of the enzymes involved in the process . The specific interactions that allow Sgol2 to perform these diverse functions in meiosis were also identified . Thus , Rattani et al . show that in linking so many essential processes throughout meiosis , Sgol2 appears to have a key , if not unique , role in determining the fate of chromosomes as cells divide .\",\n          \"Forgetting is a common experience in our everyday life . Yet much remains unknown about how we remember , and about why our memories sometimes fail us . The brain contains 80 to 100 billion nerve cells or neurons , which communicate with one another at junctions called synapses . At a synapse , one neuron releases a chemical message , which must diffuse across a small gap , and then activate proteins called receptors on another neuron . If the first neuron activates the second repeatedly , the second cell responds by inserting additional receptors into its membrane at the synapse . This strengthens the connection between the two neurons . Strengthening of synapses is thought to be one of the key mechanisms underlying learning . To confirm this , it would be helpful to be able to monitor the movement and position of individual receptors at synapses . However , the space between the two nerve cells at at synapse , called the synaptic cleft , is no more than 40 nanometers wide . This is about 25 times thinner than a human hair , and too small to be seen with light microscopy . Electron microscopy can visualize synapses , but does not work in living tissue . The only other option is to attach a fluorescent label \\u2013 either a dye or a man-made crystal called a quantum dot \\u2013 to a protein found in synapses and monitor the resulting fluorescence . Though the probe must be small enough to pass through the synaptic cleft to do this . Using fluorescence microscopy , researchers have examined the distribution in synapses of proteins called AMPA receptors , which have a key role in memory . Multiple studies have shown groups of AMPA receptors gathered outside synapses . This has led to the suggestion that during learning , AMPA receptors wait outside the synapse until a space becomes available within the synapse\\u2019s membrane . However , this has yet to be confirmed directly , in part because conventional fluorescent dyes and quantum dots are too bulky to enter synaptic clefts when bound to a receptor . Lee et al . have now developed a quantum dot that is only 10 nanometers wide and therefore small enough to enter the synaptic cleft with an AMPA receptor attached . These small quantum dots were then used to label AMPA receptors in neurons collected from rats and then grown in a petri dish , which provided a completely new view of synapses . The images show that the majority of AMPA receptors in neurons circulate within confined domains \\u2013 a little like holding pens \\u2013 inside the synapse , rather than waiting outside as previously assumed . Labeling the receptors with smaller 4-nanometer-wide fluorescent tags produces a similar picture . Further work is still need to determine how AMPA receptors get into the synapse and contribute to new memories .\",\n          \"It can take several months , or even years , for the brain of a young animal to develop and refine the complex neural networks which underpin cognitive abilities such as memory , planning , and decision making . While the properties that support these functions have been well-documented , less is known about how they emerge during development . Dom\\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . therefore set out to determine when exactly these properties began to take shape in mice , using lightweight nets of electrodes to record brain activity in sleeping newborn pups . The nets were designed to avoid disturbing the animals or damaging their fragile brains . The recordings showed that patterns of brain activity similar to those seen in adults emerged during the first couple of weeks after birth . Just before , however , the brains of the pups went through a brief period of reduced activity: this lull seemed to mark a transition from an immature to a more mature mode of operation . After this pause , neurons in the mouse brains showed coordinated patterns of firing reminiscent of those seen in adults . By monitoring the brains of human babies using scalp sensors , Dom\\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . showed that a similar transition also occurs in infants during their first few months of life , suggesting that brains may mature via a process retained across species . Overall , the relative lull in activity before transition may mark when neural networks gain mature properties; in the future , it could therefore potentially be used to diagnose and monitor individuals with delayed cognitive development .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Accurate chromosome segregation depends on coordination between cohesion resolution and kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( K-fibers ) , a process regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) . How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear . We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) in addition to protecting cohesin , plays an important role in turning off the SAC , in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles , in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching . Sgol2\\u2019s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A , as is its ability to silence the SAC , with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2 . In contrast , its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively . By virtue of its multiple interactions , Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation . \\n The production of haploid gametes from diploid germ cells depends on two rounds of chromosome segregation ( meiosis I and II ) without an intervening round of DNA replication . Defects during the first or second meiotic division in oocytes lead to formation of aneuploid eggs , which in humans occurs with a frequency between 10 and 30% and is a major cause of fetal miscarriages ( Hassold and Hunt , 2001 ) . Understanding the causes of meiotic chromosome missegregation will require clarifying not only the forces and regulatory mechanisms governing meiotic chromosome segregation but also how these are coordinated . At the heart of this process are two opposing forces . The pulling forces produced by kinetochore-microtubules attachments ( K-fibers ) and resisting forces generated by sister chromatid cohesion , which counteracts K-fiber forces if and when kinetochores attach to microtubules with different polarities . During meiosis I , cohesion along chromosome arms holds bivalent chromosomes together following the creation of chiasmata produced by reciprocal recombination between homologous non-sister chromatids . This cohesion must persist during the attachment of maternal and paternal kinetochores to microtubules from opposite poles ( bi-orientation ) and resist the resulting spindle forces . The degree of traction exerted by meiotic spindles must create sufficient tension to facilitate bi-orientation ( Tachibana-Konwalski et al . , 2010 ) . During the bi-orientation process , the initial attachment of kinetochores to the surface of the microtubule lattice ( lateral attachment ) is converted to attachments to their plus ends ( end on attachment ) , creating K-fibers . Because this process is intrinsically error prone , inappropriate attachments , for example those that connect maternal and paternal kinetochores to the same pole , must be disrupted through phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by Aurora B/C kinases ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . However , because these kinases disrupt K-fibers , they must subsequently be down regulated once bivalents bi-orient correctly . The first meiotic division is eventually triggered by activation of a gigantic ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome ( APC/C ) whose destruction of securin and cyclin B activates a thiol protease called separase that cleaves the kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex holding sister chromatids together ( McGuinness et al . , 2005; Kudo et al . , 2006 ) . This process converts chromosomes from bivalents to dyads . It is delayed until all bivalents have bi-oriented by the production , at kinetochores that have not yet come under tension , of a potent inhibitor of the APC/C called the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) whose Mad2 subunit binds tightly to the APC/C\\u2019s Cdc20 co-activator protein . This regulatory mechanism , called the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) , must be turned off before APC/CCdc20 can direct destruction of securin and cyclin B and thereby activate separase . Another pre-condition for cleavage , at least in yeast , is phosphorylation of cohesin\\u2019s kleisin subunit by a pair of protein kinases , namely CK1\\u03b4/\\u03b5 and DDK ( Ishiguro et al . , 2010; Katis et al . , 2010 ) . During the first meiotic division , cohesin is phosphorylated along chromosome arms but not at centromeres , which ensures that only cohesion along arms is destroyed by separase at the onset of anaphase I . The consequent persistence of cohesion at centromeres promotes bi-orientation of dyads during meiosis II . Centromeric cohesin avoids phosphorylation and therefore cleavage during the first meiotic division because separase activation is preceded by the recruitment to centromeres of orthologues of the Drosophila MEI-S332 protein , called shugoshins . Members of this family contain a conserved C-terminal basic region and an N-terminal homodimeric parallel coiled coil , which provides a docking site for protein phosphatase 2A\\u2019s ( PP2A ) C and B\\u2019 subunits ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . In budding yeast , mutant proteins defective specifically in PP2A binding fail to confer protection of centromeric cohesion during meiosis I ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Mammals have two members of the shugoshin family: Shugoshin-like protein 1 ( Sgol1 ) , and Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) . The former prevents centromeric cohesin from a process called the \\u2018prophase pathway\\u2019 that removes cohesin from chromosomes by a non-proteolytic mechanism soon after cells enter mitosis ( McGuinness et al . , 2005; Liu et al . , 2013 ) . Sgol2 , on the other hand , protects centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al . , 2008; Llano et al . , 2008 ) . Sgol2\\u2019s coiled coil domain binds PP2A in vitro ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) but whether this is vital for protecting centromeric cohesion is not known . Sgol2 also interacts with MCAK ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) , a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin , implicated in correcting inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( error correction ) , and with Mad2 an essential component of the MCC ( Orth et al . , 2011 ) . Shugoshins , though not explicitly Sgol2 , have also been implicated in recruiting to kinetochores the Aurora B kinase , necessary both for the SAC and for error correction ( Tsukahara et al . , 2010; Yamagishi et al . , 2010 ) . Based on its interactions , Sgol2 has been linked to cohesion protection , the spindle assembly checkpoint , and error correction pathways . However , the physiological significance of these multiple interactions remain unclear . We show here that Sgol2 defective in PP2A binding fails to protect centromeric cohesin , as found for Sgo1 in yeast ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . However , if this were the sole function of Sgol2 , then chromosome behavior during meiosis I should be unaffected . To our surprise , we found that Sgol2 deficiency caused striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics . It delayed bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles , caused increased bivalent stretching , and greatly increased Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores , which was accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end on kinetochore-microtubules attachments . Lastly , Sgol2 deficiency delayed considerably APC/CCdc20 activation , suggesting that it was required to shut off the SAC . Sgol2 helps to turn off the SAC by binding directly both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2 , it moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting to kinetochores the kinesin MCAK , and likely promotes formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B/C kinase specifically at kinetochores . Meiotic chromosome segregation is a highly complex process dependent on an array of different biochemical processes . Our findings imply that through its multi-domain structure , Sgol2 has an important if not unique role in coordinating many of the key processes within this array . \\n An essential feature of shugoshins is a conserved N-terminal homodimeric coiled coil that binds PP2A ( Figure 1A ) . Unlike Sgol1 , which only interacts stably with the PP2A holoenzyme ( a complex of A , B\\u2019 and C subunits ) , Sgol2 also associates with a core complex containing only A and C subunits ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . To create versions of Sgol2 defective specifically in binding PP2A , conserved residues ( namely L51 , N54 , R56 , and E82 ) predicted to interact directly with PP2A were substituted by alanine or in the case of E82 also by lysine ( Figure 1B ) . Likewise , the highly conserved asparagine ( N55 on Sgol2 ) , corresponding to N61 in Sgol1 , which forms a hydrogen bond within the coiled coil enabling it to adopt a conformation compatible with PP2A binding , was substituted by isoleucine ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , binding between purified Flag- and His-tagged Sgol2 fragments spanning the coiled coil ( cc ) region ( 31\\u2013117 ) was unaffected by any of these mutations , implying that all permit coiled coil formation . A triple mutation L51A/N54A/R56A ( 3A ) reduced dimerization modestly ( Figure 1D ) but this effect was not seen when the two proteins were co-expressed in bacteria ( Figure 1E ) . To assess the effects on PP2A binding , GST-tagged PP2A A subunit was incubated with B\\u2019 and C subunits in the presence of MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag . Pull down experiments revealed that N55I and the 3A triple mutation abolished co-purification of Sgol2 with the GST-tagged A subunit while N54A and R56A reduced it . In contrast , L51A and E82A had little or no effect while E82K caused a modest reduction ( Figure 1F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 003Figure 1 .

Homodimerisation was assessed by the relative abundance of each form in the IP by western blots . ( E ) Co-immunoprecipitation assay of MBP-Sgol2cc from wild type and 3A mutant are shown to validate the homodimerisation of coiled coil domains .

Fragments from Xenopus Sgol1 , with and without MIM domain , were used as positive and negative controls . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 003 To investigate whether association of PP2A with Sgol2\\u2019s coiled coil is necessary for protecting centromeric cohesion , we compared the effect of the mutations on PP2A\\u2019s co-localization with Sgol2 at kinetochores with their effect on the maintenance of cohesion after oocytes have undergone the first meiotic division . Sgol2 and PP2A co-localize at inner kinetochores of bivalent chromosomes at metaphase I in wild type oocytes ( Figure 2A ) but neither protein was detected at this location in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes ( n = 26 ) . Importantly , microinjection of wild type Sgol2 encoding mRNA into sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes restored accumulation at kinetochores of both Sgol2 and PP2A at metaphase I . In contrast , microinjection of mRNAs carrying N54A , N55I , or 3A mutations restored Sgol2 but not PP2A ( Figure 2A ) , implying that binding of PP2A to Sgol2\\u2019s coiled coil is necessary for recruiting the phosphatase to kinetochores in vivo . Chromosome spreads revealed that the failure of sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes to maintain cohesion between sister centromeres after meiosis I was reversed by microinjection of wild type but not N54A , N55I , or 3A mRNAs ( Figure 2B ) . L51A and E82A , which had little or no effect on PP2A\\u2019s binding to Sgol2\\u2019s coiled coil in vitro , also fully restored cohesion protection while R56A and E82K , which caused a modest reduction in the Sgol2cc-PP2A interaction vitro , only partially restored it , producing metaphase II oocytes containing individual chromatids as well as dyads ( Figure 2B ) . Lastly , we noticed that injection of 3A Sgol2 mRNAs also produced centromeric cohesion defects in wild type oocytes ( Figure 3A , B ) . The correlation between the effects of mutations on binding PP2A in vitro and on protecting cohesion in vivo implies that the interaction of PP2A with Sgol2\\u2019s coiled coil is essential for protecting cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 004Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 005 DIC video microscopy revealed that sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes extruded polar bodies on average 2 hr later than oocytes from wild type littermates . Moreover , only 61% of sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes extruded the first polar body compared with 88% in wild type controls ( Figure 4A ) . To investigate this , wild type and sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes were microinjected with mRNA encoding histone H2B-mCherry to mark chromosomes and Securin-eGFP to measure APC/CCdc20 activity ( Figure 4B ) . 40% of mutant oocytes failed to activate APC/CCdc20 compared to 12% in wild type controls ( Figure 4C ) , and those that did so were delayed by about 2 hr ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Surprisingly , microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA not only increased the fraction of oocytes that activated APC/CCdc20 to wild type levels ( 89% ) , but also advanced activation so that it took place about 2 hr earlier than in wild type ( Figure 4E\\u2013G , Figure 4\\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 ) . Because microinjection of mRNA encoding a version of Cdc20 ( R132A ) that cannot bind Mad2 , but not wild type Cdc20 , induced securin destruction in all sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes ( Figure 4C ) , we conclude that Sgol2 facilitates APC/CCdc20 activation by silencing the SAC and that this process is dose dependent . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 006Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 009 The recent observation that shugoshins , like Sgol2 from humans and Sgo1 from Xenopus , bind Mad2 in a manner similar to Mad1 and Cdc20 through a conserved Mad2 Interaction Motif ( MIM ) ( Orth et al . , 2011 ) provided a clue as to how Sgol2 might regulates the SAC . This motif is conserved in mouse Sgol2 ( Figure 1C ) and far-western blots confirmed that interaction between mSgol2 and Mad2 is weakened by substituting the basic amino acid at its center with alanine ( H150A ) or glutamic acid ( H150E ) ( Figure 1G ) . Strikingly , H150E and H150A Sgol2 mRNAs were less effective than wild type in increasing the fraction of sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes that activated APC/CCdc20 ( Figure 4E ) . They also failed to advance the timing of activation ( Figure 4F , Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 2B , C ) . Importantly , neither mutation affected Sgol2\\u2019s association with kinetochores , its ability to recruit PP2A ( Figure 3C ) or MCAK ( Figure 5A ) to this location , or protection of centromeric cohesion ( Figure 3D ) . Interestingly , N54A , which reduces PP2A binding , also abrogated Sgol2\\u2019s ability to promote APC/CCdc20 activation ( Figure 4E , F , Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 2A , D ) without having any effect on MCAK recruitment ( Figure 5A ) . We conclude that Sgol2 has an important role in silencing the SAC during meiosis I by binding directly both to Mad2 and PP2A . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 010Figure 5 .

Scale bars represent 5 \\u03bcm . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 012 We noticed that chiasmata appeared terminalized in a large fraction of bivalent chromosomes from sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes ( Figure 5A ) . Because this effect was not accompanied by any reduction of cohesin along inter-chromatid axes ( Figure 5B ) , it is unlikely to be caused by precocious Rec8 cleavage . Live cell imaging of oocytes microinjected at the GV stage with mRNAs encoding H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that maternal and paternal kinetochores were pulled further apart in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes at metaphase I ( t test , p<0 . 0001 ) . In other words , bivalents were stretched more and possibly the stretching of distal parts of bivalent chromosomes resulted in increased separation of homologous pairs on chromosome spreads . Importantly , increased kinetochore separation in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes was invariably observed on bivalents that had bi-oriented ( Figures 5C and 6; see also Videos 1 and 2 ) , but was not accompanied by any change in the overall length of metaphase I spindles ( ANOVA , p=0 . 97; Figure 5D ) . Interestingly , microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA not only rescued chiasmata structure ( Figure 5A ) , but also reduced inter-kinetochore distances to below that seen in wild type ( Figures 5C and 6; Video 3 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) , without altering spindle length ( Figure 5D ) . Because a similar reduction in inter-kinetochore distances was observed with N54A or H150E mutations ( Figures 5C and 6; Videos 4 and 5 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) , regulation of bivalent stretching by Sgol2 does not depend on its ability to bind PP2A or Mad2 . Thus , the effect cannot be due to changes either in arm cohesion protection or duration of metaphase I . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 013Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 019 Inter-kinetochore distances correlated inversely with GFP-MCAK signals at kinetochores . Thus , MCAK is missing from kinetochores in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes and more abundant ( even than wild type ) in mutant cells microinjected with Sgol2 mRNA ( Figures 5A , C and 6 ) . Because phosphorylation of human Sgol2 at T537 and T620 ( corresponding to T521 and T600 on M . m Sgol2 ) by Aurora B has been implicated in the association of MCAK with Sgol2 in mitotic cells ( Tanno et al . , 2010 ) , we tested the effect of AZD1152 , an Aurora B ( and C ) kinase inhibitor . This eliminated accumulation at kinetochores of both T521 phosphorylated Sgol2 ( Figure 7B ) and MCAK ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Crucially , injection of mRNA encoding T521A T600A Sgol2 into sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes failed to restore accumulation of MCAK at kinetochores ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and to reduce inter-kinetochore distances ( Figures 5C and 6; Video 6 , t test p=0 . 027 ) . Interestingly , neither the Aurora B/C inhibitor nor T521A T600A prevented MCAK\\u2019s recruitment to chromosome arms ( Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The effect of T521A T600A on MCAK\\u2019s kinetochore binding was highly specific as the mutant Sgol2 protein still accumulated at kinetochores ( albeit to a lesser extent ) , recruited PP2A to this location , and protected centromeric cohesion from separase ( Figure 5E , F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 020Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 021 These observations suggest that bivalent stretching might be inhibited by recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by Sgol2 . If so , increased inter-kinetochore distances in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes should be reduced by targeting MCAK to centromeres by artificial means , namely by expression of an MCAK protein whose N-terminus is fused to the C-terminus of CENPB-eGFP . Remarkably , CENPB-eGFP-MCAK , but not CENPB-eGFP , reduced inter-kinetochore distances ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 2; Video 7 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) . We conclude that Sgol2 moderates the pulling force exerted on bivalents by recruiting MCAK to kinetochores , a process dependent on phosphorylation of Sgol2 by Aurora B/C kinases . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 022Video 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 022 The period between Germinal Vesicle Breakdown ( GVBD ) and anaphase can be divided according to the state of spindles and chromosomes into four distinct phases ( Schuh and Ellenberg , 2007; Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . During phase 1 , multiple microtubule-organizing centers ( MTOCs ) form a ball of polymerizing microtubules on whose surface chromosomes are distributed individually . This is followed by a period ( phase 2 ) in which chromosomes slide laterally over the ball shaped spindle apparatus , eventually congressing to form a \\u2018prometaphase\\u2019 belt around it . During phase 3 , chromosomes invade the cluster of microtubules , which elongates along an axis perpendicular to the earlier chromosome belt , forming a barrel-shaped bipolar spindle . This highly dynamic phase culminates when chromosomes bi-orient on a metaphase plate within the bipolar spindle . During the fourth and final stage ( phase 4 ) , bi-oriented chromosomes oscillate around the metaphase plate with low amplitudes ( Phase 4 ) . Live-cell confocal imaging of wild type mouse oocytes microinjected with H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that MCAK accumulates at MTOCs and on microtubules during phase 1 ( Figure 6; Video 1 ) but does not appear at kinetochores until chromosomes congress on the surface of the ball at the start of phase 2 . This event is accompanied by an increase in Sgol2\\u2019s abundance at kinetochores and by phosphorylation of T521 ( Figure 7A , B ) . MCAK\\u2019s abundance at kinetochores gradually increases during phase 3 as chromosomes invade the spindle apparatus and peaks as chromosomes bi-orient on the metaphase plate ( Figure 6 , top panel; Video 1 ) . This sequence of events is substantially altered in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes . Though GFP-MCAK co-localizes with MTOCs and microtubules , it never subsequently accumulates at kinetochores ( Figure 6 ) . Chromosomes associate with the surface of the ball , albeit more loosely than in wild type , and undergo visible stretching instead of forming a prometaphase belt ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 1; Video 2 ) . This excessive stretching becomes even more pronounced upon formation of bipolar spindles . Thus , the clear demarcation of congression during phase 2 and bi-orientation during phase 3 was largely absent . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNAs into sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes greatly accelerated both invasion of the ball by chromosomes and their bi-orientation , with the latter occurring even earlier than in wild type oocytes and before metamorphosis of the ball into a bipolar spindle ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 1; Video 3 ) . Thus , while loss of Sgol2 delays bi-orientation , the modest over-expression caused by mRNA microinjection accelerates this process . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 023Figure 8 . Sgol2 promotes bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes by increasing kinetochore-microtubule interactions . ( A ) To study the relative distributions of chromosomes on the ball shaped spindle , at 2\\u20133 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were treated with Ca2+ buffer for 90 s and then fixed in 1% PFA .

At 6 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were fixed in 1% PFA were stained with anti-\\u03b2-tubulin ( microtubules , green ) , CREST ( kinetochores , red ) , and DAPI ( chromosomes , blue ) . For Aurora B/C inhibition , oocytes harvested from Sgol2 knockout females were cultured in M16 medium for 4 hr . At 4 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were transferred to M16 medium supplemented with low concentration ( 20 nM ) of AZD1152 inhibitor . Oocytes were cultured until 6 hr post-GVBD and were then fixed in 1% PFA . Scale bars represent 5 \\u03bcm . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 023 Crucially , the precocious bi-orientation caused by Sgol2 mRNA injection was unaffected by N54A or by H150E mutations but abrogated by T521A T600A ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 1; Videos 4 , 5 , 6 ) , which also abolished MCAK\\u2019s accumulation at kinetochores and compromised chromosome alignment ( Figures 5A and 6 , Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , possibly due to increased association of MCAK with the arms of bivalent chromosomes ( Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Injection of Sgol2 T521A T600A still advanced polar body extrusion ( Figure 6 ) , demonstrating that SAC silencing by Sgol2 does not depend on rapid or possibly even accurate chromosome bi-orientation and suggesting that these activities are mediated by separate domains within Sgol2 . Surprisingly , injection of mRNAs encoding CENPB-eGFP-MCAK instead of Sgol2 did not accelerate chromosome bi-orientation ( data not shown ) , raising the possibility that Sgol2 facilitates bi-orientation by a mechanism either independent of or in addition to MCAK\\u2019s recruitment to kinetochores . Because , bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes correlates with the appearance of kinetochore-microtubule bundles ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) , we visualized these in oocytes fixed in 1% PFA following a brief treatment with a calcium-containing buffer , which destabilizes the more dynamic non-kinetochore-microtubules . This revealed three differences between wild type and sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD , when most kinetochores in wild type have relinquished lateral and formed end on attachments and chromosomes have bi-oriented . Kinetochore associated microtubules bundles ( K-fibers ) were thinner and more sparse , lateral attachments were greatly increased in frequency , and kinetochores ( as detected by CREST antibodies ) were frequently highly stretched in mutant oocytes ( Figure 8B ) . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA had the opposite effect , eliminating lateral attachments and kinetochore stretching while greatly increasing the abundance of end-on microtubules associated with each kinetochore , an effect abrogated by T521A T600A ( Figure 8B ) . This suggests that the accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C kinase stimulates the conversion of lateral to end on attachments and that this may be the mechanism by which Sgol2 accelerates chromosome bi-orientation . Because injection of CENPB-eGFP-MCAK mRNAs instead of Sgol2 largely failed to increase end-on attachments at the expense of lateral ones ( Figure 8B ) , we suspect that Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C has a function at kinetochores besides MCAK recruitment ( see below ) . Because Aurora B kinase destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments , at least partly by phosphorylating proteins within the KMN network ( Welburn et al . , 2010 ) , we tested whether Sgol2 altered the phosphorylation of Ser24 on Knl1 ( p-Knl1 ) . Remarkably , the ratio of p-Knl1 to CREST signals in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD was more than double that of wild type controls ( Figure 9A ) . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA reduced this to below wild type , an effect unaltered by N54A but largely abolished by T521A T600A ( Figure 9A ) . Similar results were obtained using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser100 on Dsn1 ( data not shown ) and one that detects activating auto-phosphorylation of Aurora A/B/C at Thr288 , Thr232 , or Thr198 ( p-Aurora ) , respectively ( Figure 9B ) . Interestingly , these effects were specific to kinetochores as auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C on chromosome arms was unaltered in the mutant oocytes ( Figure 9B ) . Importantly , Sgol2 did not alter the overall amount of Aurora C at kinetochores ( Figure 10 ) . These results imply that Sgol2 counters phosphorylation of KMN network proteins by a mechanism not involving its recruitment of PP2A . Strangely , this process seems to depend on Sgol2\\u2019s prior phosphorylation by the very same kinases that it ultimately inhibits . In other words , Aurora B/C creates its own inhibitor at kinetochores , creating a negative feedback loop . Consistent with this notion , the gradual accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated at T521 following GVBD ( Figure 7B ) is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in Dsn1 Ser100 phosphorylation ( Figure 9D ) . Critically , Sgol2\\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores does not depend on kinetochore-microtubule interactions , as Sgol2 reduced auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C even in the presence of microtubule destabilizing drug ( Figure 9C ) . To address whether hyper-activity of Aurora B/C at kinetochores could be responsible for the paucity of K-fibers in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes , we tested the effect of the Aurora kinase inhibitor AZD1152 . This both increased the density of K-fibers and reduced kinetochore stretching but did not eliminate lateral attachments ( Figure 8B ) , which may require direct involvement of MCAK . We suggest that Sgol2 promotes chromosome bi-orientation by inhibiting Aurora B/C kinase as well as by recruiting MCAK . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 024Figure 9 .

Our creation and analysis of mutations within Sgol2\\u2019s highly conserved coiled coil reveals the likely mechanism , namely recruitment of PP2A to centromeres . PP2A might protect cohesin from separase either directly , by binding ( Holland et al . , 2007 ) and inhibiting separase activity , or indirectly , by reversing phosphorylation of cohesin\\u2019s Rec8 subunit ( Katis et al . , 2010 ) , a process known to be important for its cleavage in yeast . However , if cohesion protection were Sgol2\\u2019s sole function , then its depletion should not compromise chromosome segregation during meiosis I . The precocious loss of cohesion should only affect the second meiotic division . On the contrary , depletion of Sgol2 specifically in oocytes has highly pleiotropic consequences already during meiosis I . These include inefficient SAC silencing , greatly increased bivalent stretching , and major alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments ( K-fibers ) . We show that Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2\\u2019s other two partners Cdc20 and Mad1 . This raises the possibility that Sgol2 silences the SAC by competing with Cdc20 for the binding of activated Mad2 , thereby preventing formation of the MCC . However , this cannot be the full story as SAC silencing also depends on Sgol2\\u2019s ability to bind PP2A . Because Sgol2\\u2019s MIM motif is close to the coiled coil by which it binds PP2A , it is conceivable that PP2A directly ( i . e . , structurally ) facilitates the formation or stability of \\u2018closed\\u2019 complexes between Sgol2 and Mad2 . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only dephosphorylated Mad2 interacts with Cdc20 and Sgol2 , while a phosphomimetic mutant of Mad2 cannot associate with either of these proteins ( personal communication Michael Orth ) . Thus , PP2A could selectively stabilize the Sgol2-Mad2 complex by keeping Mad2 in a de-phosphorylated state . Therefore , it is conceivable that if there were sufficient turnover of Mad2 bound to MCC , then PP2A could promote the Sgol2: Mad2 complex formation and thus alter the activity of the MCC responsible for inhibiting the APC/C . Unlike centromeric protection and SAC silencing , Sgol2\\u2019s regulation of bivalent stretching depends not on its ability to bind PP2A but instead on phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by Aurora B/C kinases . This facilitates MCAK accumulation at kinetochores . Because artificial recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by fusion to CENP-B substitutes for Sgol2 with regard to bivalent stretching , we suggest that it is the population of MCAK recruited to kinetochores by Sgol2 that moderates the pulling forces exerted on maternal and paternal kinetochores , possibly by reducing the incidence of lateral attachments . Artificial MCAK recruitment did not however restore normal looking end on attachments or greatly facilitate bi-orientation in Sgol2 deficient oocytes , implying that Sgol2 has yet another function at kinetochores besides recruiting PP2A and MCAK . Our observation that auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C kinases as well as phosphorylation of KMN proteins are elevated in Sgol2\\u2019s absence but depressed upon microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA suggests that this other function of Sgol2 is to act as a kinetochore-specific inhibitor of Aurora B/C kinases . The notion that Sgol2 moderates Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores was unexpected , as it has been reported that xSgo2 , a newly discovered homolog of shugoshin in Xenopus , actually promotes Aurora Kinase activity , generating a favourable environment for microtubule polymerization ( Rivera et al . , 2012 ) . In this case , the effect may be systemic , that is throughout the cytoplasm , whereas M . m Sgol2 appears to act as an inhibitor only at kinetochores . A remarkable feature of this effect is that Sgol2\\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinases at kinetochores depends on its prior phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by the very same Aurora kinases . In other words , Aurora B/C kinase creates its own inhibitor , generating a negative feedback loop . Whether the phosphorylation of Sgol2 necessary for it to act as an inhibitor of Aurora kinases at kinetochores is also generated at this location or along chromosome arms or elsewhere in the cell is currently unclear . Irrespective of its precise spatial and dynamic properties , this negative feedback loop may be an important feature of meiosis I . Aurora B/C protein kinases have a key role in destabilizing inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule attachments , namely those that do not generate tension ( Lampson and Cheeseman , 2011 ) . They are therefore essential for the efficient bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes . However , it is important that the de-stabilization process is eventually turned off so that correctly attached bivalents remain stably attached to microtubules . Hitherto , it has been assumed that the mechanism responsible for turning off these kinases merely involved physical forces that pull Aurora substrates away from the enzymes when maternal and paternal kinetochores are pulled in opposite directions ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Though our work does not preclude a role for traction in down regulating Aurora B/C\\u2019s access to kinetochore-bound substrates , it raises the possibility that down regulation is also an intrinsic feature of a biochemical system in which Aurora B/C activates its own inhibitor . The regulatory network revealed by our work ensures that Aurora B/C kinases will be active early during the bi-orientation , when incorrect attachments may be more frequent , and less active later , when they have been largely eliminated . It is possible that during the period when Aurora B/C kinases are active , the selective stabilization of correct attachments is mediated by mechanical changes within kinetochores induced by tension , as recently observed in purified yeast kinetochores ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ) , not as originally thought by tension dependent changes in Aurora kinase activity , for which there has never been much direct evidence . We suggest that an important feature of meiosis I in oocytes is an early phase of high Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores followed by a later phase of lowered activity made possible by the Aurora B/C-Sgol2 negative feedback loop . The lowered activity of Aurora B/C might increase the MT-depolymerizing activity of MCAK at kinetochores ( Andrews et al . , 2004 ) . This is supported by the fact that the kinetochore pool of MCAK , recruited by Sgol2 , is indeed not phosphorylated at serine 92 in mouse oocytes ( data not shown ) . If correct , it will be important to understand the dynamic properties of the feedback loop that ensures that Aurora B/C kinases do not turn themselves off precociously . It is currently unclear whether the Aurora B/C-shugoshin feedback loop is a general feature of meiotic cells or whether it is also a feature of mitotic cells . How Sgol2 inhibits Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores is also unclear , in particular whether Sgol2 does this alone or only in conjunction with the recruitment of MCAK . Given the number of fundamental processes regulated by Sgol2 , it is surprising that sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes often manage to undergo the first meiotic division without generating massive aneuploidy . Their second meiotic division is of course completely defective due to the total absence of sister chromatid cohesion . We suggest that all of the processes regulated by Sgol2 are fundamentally essential but that they are also regulated by Sgol2-independent pathways . In other words , the processes regulated by Sgol2 may be so fundamental that there are multiple pathways regulating them . It is not inconceivable that Sgol1 , which is also expressed during meiosis , shares some functions with Sgol2 and it will therefore be interesting to analyze the phenotype of double mutant oocytes . What is possibly most remarkable is that a single protein regulates sister chromatid cohesion , chromosome traction , the spindle assembly checkpoint , and lastly Aurora B/C kinases . Crucially , by demonstrating that different point mutations alter the regulation of some but not other processes , we have proven that the pleiotropy observed in sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 oocytes is not due to knock on effects ( secondary or even tertiary pathology ) of eliminating a single function . Sgol2 possesses several different domains that regulate fundamentally different processes ( Figure 11 ) . Why so much regulation is embedded into a single protein is unclear , but we speculate that this helps the coordination of multiple processes necessary for high fidelity chromosome segregation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 026Figure 11 .

To detect Rec8 , females from a transgenic line expressing Rec8 from a bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) , with nine tandem copies of the human c-myc epitope at its C terminus , were crossed to sgol2\\u0394/+ males . Litters with genotypes sgol2\\u0394/+ ( Tg ) Rec8- Myc+ were crossed back to sgol2\\u0394/+ mice to generate sgol2\\u0394/+ ( Tg ) Rec8-Myc+ ( controls ) and sgol2\\u0394/\\u0394 ( Tg ) Rec8-Myc+ female . Prophase-arrested oocytes were harvested from ovaries excised from 8\\u201312 week old female mice . Antral follicles were isolated using sterile insulin needles in M2 medium ( Sigma-Aldrich , UK ) supplemented with 200 \\u00b5M IBMX ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . For intracellular microinjections , oocytes were placed in droplets of M2 medium with IBMX . For time-lapse confocal imaging and in vitro culture prior to preparation of chromosome spreads , oocytes were transferred into IBMX-free M16 medium and cultured at 37\\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . Capped mRNA constructs with a poly-A tail were transcribed using T3 or T7 Ultra mMESSAGE kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX , USA ) from plasmid cDNA encoding H2B-mCherry , wild type Sgol2 ( Origene , Rockville , MD , USA ) , and various mutants of Sgol2 , GFP-Sgol2 , Securin-eGFP , GFP-MCAK , CENPB-eGFP , CENPB-eGFP-MCAK , and GFP-EB3 . Fully-grown oocytes were injected with 5\\u201310 pl mRNA at a final concentration of 0 . 1 mg/ml in RNase-free water ( Ambion ) using a Pneumatic PicoPump ( World Precision Instruments ) . To allow for protein expression , following microinjection of mRNA , GV oocytes were cultured for 12 hr in M16 supplemented with IBMX . Oocytes were then washed in inhibitor-free M16 and thereafter cultured at 37\\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . During time-lapse confocal microscopy experiments , oocytes were cultured in a PeCon environmental microscope incubator at 37\\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . A Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope equipped with PC-Apochromat 63x/1 . 2 NA water immersion and PC-Apochromat 20x/0 . 8 NA objective lenses was used for image acquisition . For detection of GFP and mCherry , 488-nm and 561-nm excitation wavelengths and BP 505\\u2013550 and LP 575 filters were used . During live-cell imaging , chromosomes labeled with H2B-mCherry were tracked with an EMBL-developed tracking macro ( Rabut and Ellenberg , 2004 ) adapted to our microscope . We imaged 8 to 16 z-confocal sections ( every 1 . 5 or 2 . 0 \\u00b5m ) at 5\\u201310 min intervals for 12\\u201314 hr . Chromosome spreads from mouse oocytes were prepared as previously described ( Peters et al . , 1997; Hodges and Hunt , 2002 ) . Briefly , zona pellucida was removed by treatment with 10 mg/ml Pronase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) at 37\\u00b0C for 5\\u201310 min . Zona-free oocytes were transferred to hypotonic solution ( 50% FCS in deionized water ) for 10 min at 37\\u00b0C . Oocytes were then fixed in paraformaldehyde solution ( 1% paraformaldehyde , 0 . 15% Triton X-100 , 3 mM dithiothreitol , adjusted to pH 9 . 2 with NaOH ) in 15-well multichamber glass slide ( MP Biomedicals ) overnight at room temperature in a humidified chamber . After drying , slides were washed twice in 0 . 4% Photoflo/H2O ( Kodak ) and PBS for 5 min , at room temperature . Slides were then processed for immunostaining . In this study , we used CREST ( 1:250; Davis Lab , Davis , CA , USA ) , rabbit anti-Sgol2 serum ( 1:50; gift from JL Barbero [Parra et al . , 2009] ) , anti-phospho T521 Sgol2 ( 1:500 , gift from Yoshi Watanabe [Tanno et al . , 2010] ) , anti-MCAK ( 1:500 , gift from Duane A Compton [Mack and Compton , 2001] ) , anti-phospho S24 Knl1 ( 1:1000 , gift from Iain Cheeseman [Welburn et al . , 2010] ) , anti-phospho S100 Dsn1 ( 1:500 , gift from Iain Cheeseman [Welburn et al . , 2010] ) , antibody detecting T288 , T232 or T198 on Aurora A/B/C ( 1:50 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , anti-Aurora C ( 1:50 , Bethly Laboratories , Montgomery , TX , USA ) , mouse anti-PP2A-C ( 1:200 , BD Biosciences , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) , and anti-c-Myc ( 1:500 , Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . For analysis of K-fibers , oocytes were processed as previously described ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , after either 2 or 6 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were treated for 90 s with Ca2+ buffer ( 100 mM PIPES pH 7:0 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ) at 37\\u00b0C and then fixed in 1% formaldehyde prepared in Ca2+ buffer for 30 min at room temperature . Following fixation , oocytes were washed and extracted overnight in PBT ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ) at 4\\u00b0C . Cells were then blocked in 3% BSA with PBT ( blocking solution ) for 1 hr at room temperature . For immuno-labeling oocytes were incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C with \\u03b2-tubulin ( 1:250 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) and CREST ( 1:100 , Davis Lab , Davis , CA , USA ) antibodies , prepared in blocking solution . After four washes in PBT , oocytes were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with Alexa 488 and 568 conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:500 , Invitrogen , UK ) prepared in blocking solution . Oocytes were briefly stained with Hoechst 33 , 342 ( 20 mg/ml ) before confocal imaging . Recombinant MBP-Sgol2cc-His and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were purified from 1l of Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) RIPL ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) carrying corresponding expression cassettes in pMAL-c2x- ( Flag-tagged subunit ) and pET28b-based backbones ( His-tagged subunit ) , grown at 37\\u00b0C in 2xTY media supplemented with 25 \\u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 \\u03bcg/ml ampicillin for pMAL-c2x or 50 \\u03bcg/ml kanamycin for pET28b . At OD600 = 0 . 4 , MBP-Sgol2cc-His or -Flag synthesis was induced at 30\\u00b0C by the addition of 0 . 1 mM IPTG . After 4 hr , the cells were harvested by centrifugation , frozen in dry ice , and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C . The cell paste was re-suspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 10% glycerol , 0 . 02% Triton X-100 ) containing Roche complete EDTA free protease inhibitor , 1 mM PMSF and , for the His-tagged subunit 5 mM . Each aliquot was sonicated four times for 30 s on ice . Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm for 1 hr at 4\\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti-J26XP JLA8 . 1000 rotor . The supernatant was incubated for 2 hr at 4\\u00b0C on a 5 ml Talon column ( BD Biosciences , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) or ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel ( Sigma A2220 ) . The M2 Flag beads were washed four times with 50 ml of lysis buffer and the Talon beads were washed two times with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and two times with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 45 mM imidazole . MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag was eluted with four times 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 3 \\u00d7 FLAG peptide ( 150 ng/\\u03bcl ) . MBP-Sgol2cc-His was eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 M of imidazole . The concentration of MBP-Sgol2cc-His and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were determined by nanodrop against the lysis solution . For all binding assays , highly-purified PP2A subunits ( purified as previously described [Cho and Xu , 2007] ) and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were used . To test the binding of PP2A to mutant shugoshin , 20 \\u03bcg of GST-tagged PP2A A subunit were incubated with excess amounts of PP2A B56- and C- subunit and MBP-tagged shugoshin for 1 hr on ice . Subsequently , samples were incubated with 40 \\u03bcl of glutathione beads ( GE Healthcare ) for 20 min . Beads were then washed 4 \\u00d7 with 1 ml each of 1 \\u00d7 PBS , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , boiled in reducing SDS loading buffer , and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining . His and Flag-tagged mSgol2cc from wild type and 3A were co-expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) RIPL for 4 hr at 30\\u00b0C with 0 . 1 mM of IPTG . Cells were spun at 25 , 000 rpm for 1 hr at 4\\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti-J26XP JLA8 . 1000 rotor . The pellet was re-suspended into lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH = 7; 250 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol , 0 . 02% Triton X-100; protease inhibitor ) . 10 mg of extract were incubated with 100 \\u03bcl of Talon beads for 2 hr at 4\\u00b0C . The beads were wash five times with the lysis buffer containing 23 mM of imidazole . MBP-Sgol2cc-His was eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 M of imidazole . Affinity purified material and input were resolved by SDS-PAGE . The abundance of His and Flag-tagged MBP-Sgol2cc were analyzed by western blot using anti-Flag ( 1:10 , 000 ) and anti-His ( 1:10 , 000 ) antibodies .\",\n          \"Previous studies tracking AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) diffusion at synapses observed a large mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR pool . Using super-resolution microscopy , we examined how fluorophore size and photostability affected AMPAR trafficking outside of , and within , post-synaptic densities ( PSDs ) from rats . Organic fluorescent dyes ( \\u22484 nm ) , quantum dots , either small ( \\u224810 nm diameter; sQDs ) or big ( >20 nm; bQDs ) , were coupled to AMPARs via different-sized linkers . We find that >90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorescent dyes or sQDs were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSDs , which were stable for 15 min or longer . Less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile . In contrast , 5\\u201310% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs and 90\\u201395% were extrasynaptic as previously observed . Contrary to the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD \\u2018slots\\u2019 , our findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable \\u2018nanodomains\\u2019 in PSDs with lifetime >15 min , and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes . \\n A major goal of cellular and molecular neuroscience is to characterize how synapses change during synaptic plasticity , the leading cellular correlate of learning and memory ( Volk et al . , 2015; Huganir and Nicoll , 2013; Kneussel and Hausrat , 2016 ) . The position and dynamics of the two major ionotropic glutamate receptors ( iGluRs ) , \\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( AMPARs ) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDARs ) , are critical for synaptic strength . AMPARs traffic intracellularly from sites of synthesis and assembly to exocytosis sites near synapses ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012; Henley et al . , 2011; Greger and Esteban , 2007 ) . Despite much elegant work , it is still unclear what mechanisms limit AMPAR entry into and exit out of PSDs ( Malinow and Malenka , 2002 ) ( Park et al . , 2004 ) ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . The different steps involved in AMPAR trafficking at synapses under constitutive conditions ( no plasticity ) are depicted schematically in Figure 1a . As shown , AMPAR trafficking consists of its exo- and endocytosis at sites on the plasma membrane ( steps 1 and 1\\u2019 , respectively ) , diffusion to and from these sites and PSDs ( steps 2 and 2\\u2019 ) and entry into and exit from PSDs ( steps 3 and 3\\u2019 ) . The positioning of the AMPAR endo- and exocytosis sites with respect to PSDs is uncertain with some evidence for endo- and exocytosis sites within spines relatively close to PSDs ( Kennedy et al . , 2010; Lu et al . , 2007 ) , other evidence that the sites are on dendrite shafts outside of spines ( Yudowski et al . , 2007; Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) , and also that both locations may exist regulated by synaptic plasticity ( Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . Another complication is that the recycling pathway under constitutive conditions may be different from the pathway with synaptic plasticity ( Zheng et al . , 2015; Henley et al . , 2011 ) . This suggests that different endo- and exocytosis sites may exist under constitutive conditions versus synaptic plasticity . In the last decade , advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques have pioneered work on iGluR dynamics ( Heine et al . , 2008; Groc et al . , 2007; Nair et al . , 2013; MacGillavry et al . , 2013; Kneussel and Hausrat , 2016 ) . Commercial or \\u2018big\\u2019 quantum dots ( bQDs ) with a diameter\\u00a0>20 nm were observed ( at least occasionally ) within synaptic clefts of inhibitory synapses by electron microscopy ( Dahan et al . , 2003 ) . bQDs are extremely bright , photostable and their position can be localized to within\\u00a0~10 nm in the millisecond time-scale ( Pinaud et al . , 2010 ) . Studies of AMPARs tagged with bQDs led to the conclusion that 50\\u201380% of AMPARs are extrasynaptic and highly mobile ( Groc et al . , 2007; Opazo et al . , 2010 ) . This significant highly mobile pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs has been proposed to exist because of the slow rate that extrasynaptic AMPARs enter PSDs . This slow rate of motion and accumulation of extra-synaptic AMPARs is thought to occur because of the limited availability of \\u2018slots\\u2019 in PSDs ( See Figure 1a , route 3 ) ( Shi et al . , 2001; Opazo et al . , 2012 ) . Slots are defined as placeholders for AMPARs in PSDs ( Malinow et al . , 2000 ) . Once in PSD slots , AMPARs are generally assumed to be immobilized , although Nair et al . observed that AMPARs underwent constrained diffusion in what they defined as \\u2018nanodomains\\u2019 , that\\u00a0is sub-synaptic regions where AMPARs are confined to ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) . New slots may become available when AMPARs exit from PSDs ( route 3\\u2019 ) or if more slots are created or removed by different forms of synaptic plasticity ( Malinow et al . , 2000; Shi et al . , 2001; Malinow , 2003; Giannone et al . , 2010 ) ( Groc et al . , 2007; Heine et al . , 2008 ) ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) ( Makino and Malinow , 2009 ) ( Opazo et al . , 2012 ) ( Henley and Wilkinson , 2016 ) . The presence of such a large pool of mobile AMPARs on the extrasynaptic surface of dendritic membranes is thought to be an important contributor to the mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity such as LTP and could help synapses recover from pair-pulse depression during periods of fast synaptic transmission ( Heine et al . , 2008; Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . To avoid the potential problem of using large probes , other workers have used single particle tracking ( spt ) of small ( <5 nm ) fluorescent probes permanently ( generally via a linkage protein ) or temporarily bound to an AMPAR . One such technique is called sptPALM ( spt- photoactivated localization microscopy ) where an iGluR is fused with a photoactivatable fluorescent protein ( pa-FP ) ( Manley et al . , 2008 ) . Another technique is called universal points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography ( uPAINT ) which measures an organic fluorescent probe that is temporarily bound to the receptor ( Sharonov and Hochstrasser , 2006; Giannone et al . , 2010 ) . However , there are contradictory results using these methods . Using uPAINT , AMPARs were found to be highly mobile ( Giannone et al . , 2010 ) , or stationary ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) . Using sptPALM and FRAP , another fluorescence technique , workers found that AMPARs were highly mobile . However , fluorescent proteins for sptPALM and FRAP are sensitive to both internal and external AMPAR receptors , which may obfuscate the issue ( Nair et al . , 2013; Heine et al . , 2008 ) ( Makino and Malinow , 2009; Ashby et al . , 2006 ) . Determining whether AMPARs or other neurotransmitter receptors are synaptic ( outside PSDs ) or extrasynaptic ( inside PSDs ) has been difficult because of four factors: ( 1 ) Synapses are nanometer in scale below the diffraction limit of visible microscopy; ( 2 ) Most microscopy has been limited to two-dimensions , where in reality , the dimensions are three-dimensional; ( 3 ) Recombinantly tagged imaging probes cannot readily distinguish intracellular vs . cell-surface receptors; ( 4 ) Probe photostability limits the localization precision and the length of image acquisition , particularly for single-molecule studies . Here we use 3-dimensional super-resolution microscopy on cell-surface AMPARs labeled with different-sized fluorescent probes\\u2014bQDs ( >20 nm ) , small quantum dots ( sQD \\u224810 nm ) ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) or organic fluorophore ( \\u2248 4 nm ) in cultured neurons . These probes are highly fluorescent; bQDs are nearly infinitely photostable; sQDs are photostable for several minutes; and selected organic fluorophores can be photostable for\\u00a0~1 min . We analyzed the diffusion constants , trajectories , distances from the center of PSDs , changes that occurred over time after transfection , and the role of the extracellular matrix in regulating diffusion . To better resolve PSD dimensions , we used 3-D super-resolution imaging of a PSD protein , Homer1c . We find that\\u00a0>\\u00a090% of AMPARs labeled with organic fluorescent dyes or sQDs are found in PSDs . Less than 10% of these labeled AMPARs are highly mobile and extrasynaptic . However , when AMPARs are labeled with bQDs , virtually all AMPARs ( 90\\u201395% ) are highly mobile and extrasynaptic , presumably because bQDs are sterically hindered from entry into synaptic clefts . We conclude that mobile AMPARs enter PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously observed in studies using the AMPARs labeled with bQDs . Our data further suggest that AMPAR entry is not regulated by a limited number of \\u2018slots\\u2019 where AMPARs are bound after entry into PSDs . Instead AMPARs are found to diffuse within surprisingly stable \\u2018nanodomains\\u2019 confining AMPARs to sites within PSDs that may regulate access to presynaptic glutamate release . \\n We labeled surface-expressed tagged ( AP-tag or EGFP ) versions of the GluA2 subunits of the AMPAR receptor . They were transiently transfected into cultured rat hippocampal neurons and imaged at 13\\u201316 days in vitro ( DIV ) ( see Materials\\u00a0and\\u00a0methods , and [Howarth et al . , 2005] ) . Three different fluorophores and ligands for coupling to AMPAR were used ( Figure 1c ) : ( 1 ) a small organic fluorophore coupled to streptavidin ( SA ) ; ( 2 ) a sQD with three different ligands: a limiting amount of SA such that each sQD has approximately one SA; a 13kD single-chain antibody against GFP ( from alpaca , commercially known as the Green Fluorescent Binding Protein , or GBP ) , which has only one target on a GFPN-term-AMPAR ( Ries et al . , 2012; Rothbauer et al . , 2008; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . ( In one case , it has also been directed to a pHluorin-AMPAR , a GFP-derivative ( Ashby et al . , 2004 ) . The result for this construct is the same as GFPN-term-AMPAR ) ; ( 3 ) a monomeric streptavidin ( mSA ) , which has only one binding site for biotin and was further molecular engineered from a recent one ( Lim et al . , 2013; Lim et al . , 2011; Chamma et al . , 2016 ) , in order to minimize non-specific labeling with neurons ( Materials\\u00a0and\\u00a0methods and Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The SA and mSA were used with the same AMPAR constructs as used with the bQDs . The ( tetrameric ) SA was used at a ratio of one per sQD . A commercial bQD containing many streptavidins was also used ( Figure 1c ) . Homer1c ( tag with mGeos or mEos3 . 2 ) was co transfected to generate a super-resolution marker for PSDs . For all experiments , imaging was performed using a cylindrical lens for 3D reconstruction ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) . We noticed that most surface AMPA receptors labeled with SA-bQD one day following transfection ( DIV14 ) , reside in a widely spread extra-synaptic region ( Figure 2a and e ) . This is consistent with our previous results ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) with the difference that the microscope stage drift and chromatic aberrations are corrected in this study . Chromatic aberration was corrected to with 4 nm ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . The drift was corrected to within approximately 2 nm in x and y , and 16 nm in z ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) . ( See also Materials\\u00a0and\\u00a0methods and Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 1\\u20137 ) . We also labeled AMPARs with a SA-sQD ( which is approximately half the diameter of the bQDs or 1/8th the volume ) and measured the distance of the AMPAR to the center of PSDs marked by Homer1c-mGeos . Qualitatively , the receptors are often in nanodomains , sub-synaptic regions where the receptor is confined ( Figure 2b , f; also , Figure 4d and e ) . The distance between the center of Homer1c cluster to the center of the AMPAR-sQD is close: a maximum of 150\\u00b142 nm , with 75% and 91% of receptors being localized within 0 . 5 \\u00b5m and 1 . 0 \\u00b5m , respectively , of Homer1c . Lastly , we also employed organic dyes to observe the diffusion of AMPA receptors in live neurons ( Figure 2c and g; summarized in Table 1 ) . This allows a direct comparison of AMPA receptors labeled with bQD and sQD and those labeled with organic fluorophores in live neurons . One advantage of the uPAINT technique using organic dyes compared to sptPALM is that the uPAINT technique only labels cell-surface receptors if cell-impermeable organic dyes are used . By choosing fairly photostable dyes , uPAINT also allows a relatively long time ( limited by the photobleaching ) for the motion to be measured . Here , we find that AMPARs labeled with organic-fluorophores on live cells are colocalized with Homer1c ( Figure 2c ) . To measure the overall population of AMPARs within one synapse , as opposed to the behavior of an individual AMPAR , we obtained super-resolution ( direct-STORM ) images for neuronal receptors using a heavily labeled organic fluorophore ( SA-Cy3B ) after fixing the neurons ( Figure 2d and e ) ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . Cy3B is particularly good with STORM because it can be made photoactivatable with NaBH4 ( Vaughan et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , we can label extensively with many organic fluorophores because the hydrodynamic diameter of organic fluorophores is\\u00a0~1 nanometer and even when conjugated with streptavidin , they are only about 4 nm in diameter ( Diki\\u0107 et al . , 2012 ) . Consequently , SA-organic dyes are significantly smaller than either bQDs or sQDs or even labeled-antibodies ( which are commonly used to label AMPARs ) . In addition , non-specific labeling was insignificant . These findings were similar to those obtained using sparsely labeled sQDs and organic dyes labeling on live neurons . Thus , by all three techniques ( with sQDs , with live- and fixed-neurons labeled with organic fluorophores ) we find that the localization of AMPA receptors is predominantly at the synaptic regions . In addition , we observe in these fixed samples , that there is typically one nanodomain per synapse ( Figure 2h ) , although multiple nanodomains do exist ( Figure 2j ) . For all fluorescent tags , \\u2018heat maps\\u2019 were created to plot the diffusion constants ( in \\u03bcm2/s ) versus the AMPAR trajectory range ( in \\u03bcm ) ( Figures 3\\u20135 ) . In general , the lower left-hand corner of the map shows the diffusion of AMPARs where the trajectory range is limited , constrained by PSD ( or slot ) proteins ( Shi et al . , 2001; Opazo et al . , 2012 ) , and the diffusion coefficient of these receptors was slow; those in the upper right-hand corner are not constrained and move faster . Semi-quantitatively , we define \\u2018slow\\u2019 as D \\u2264 10-1 . 75 ( 0 . 018 ) \\u03bcm2/s and \\u2018constrained\\u2019 as a trajectory range of \\u2264 10-0 . 1 ( 0 . 79 ) \\u03bcm . These criteria were used as rough guidelines to be consistent with previous work ( Constals et al . , 2015 ) ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) . The 2D heat maps can also be plotted as a function of DIV to see the effect of transfection time ( see Figures 3\\u20135 ) . Alternatively , the 2D heat maps can also be turned into regular 1D histograms by compressing one axis and fitting the data to a series of Gaussian fits ( see Figures 3\\u20135 ) . Importantly , because many cells were measured , ( 6\\u201313 different culture plates from at least four independent culture preparations , corresponding to 483\\u20131599 synapses ) , 2D histograms should be independent of absolute number of synapses ( synaptogenesis ) . We used bQDs and were able to reproduce results from previous work showing large pools of receptors outside of the synapses . At post-transfection day one there are primarily two peaks in the heat map in Figure 3a with the majority ( 73% of all AMPAR , peak\\u03b1 ) having a fairly fast diffusion constant ( 10-1 . 25=0 . 056 \\u03bcm2/s ) with about a\\u00a0~\\u00a01 . 3 \\u03bcm travel length , and a minor peak ( 27% , peak \\u03b2 ) having slower diffusion constants ( 10-2 . 5=0 . 0032 \\u03bcm2/s ) and smaller trajectory ranges ( \\u2248 0 . 5 \\u03bcm ) . As illustrated in Figure 3c , AMPARs in the \\u03b1 peak are localized outside the synaptic spine on the dendritic shaft distant from Homer1c labeling . Furthermore , the AMPARs are undergoing free diffusion confined over large ( >1 um ) regions in the dendritic shaft . The \\u03b2 peak has two components , both of which are diffusing slow . 5% of all AMPARs are colocalized with PSDs labeled by Homer1c; 22% are not localized to a labeled Homer1c ( see Figure 3d ) . This 22% component could be confined extrasynaptic AMPARs , ( possibly due to crosslinking ) , or they could be diffusing at PSDs not labeled by Homer1c . On post-transfection day 3 , the heat map in Figure 3b is significantly changed with a broader distribution of the diffusion coefficients and trajectory range , covering the range seen at post-transfection day 1 . Unlike the result at post-transfection day 1 , the population of free diffusion ( i . e . the \\u03b1 peak ) has significantly decreased , while the population of slow diffusion ( i . e . the \\u03b2 peak ) has increased . The data also show that the fraction of the slow diffusion is significantly increased on post-transfection day 3 , as compared with that on post-transfection day 1 . A representative trajectory is shown in Figure 3e , which shows the peak \\u03b3\\u00a0of the bQD undergoing limited-diffusion in a small region far from synapses similar to the \\u03b2 peak in Figure 3a . For the bQDs , we measured AMPAR diffusion as a function of DIV ( Figure 3a vs . b ) . All labels were examined after 1 day and after 3 days , following transfection , corresponding to DIV14 and DIV16 , respectively . Because we observed a change in mobility we reasoned that this could be due to cross-linking of AMPAR by the multivalent bQD , or due to an increase in the amount of extracellular matrix . Both factors are known to influence the diffusion of surface-expressed AMPARs ( Chamma et al . , 2016; Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) . ( This result is further described in Figure 6 . ) Regardless of the exact reason , the fact that labeling with bQDs is a function of the number of DIVs is problematic . When using sQDs , we found no accumulation of large pools of extra-synaptic receptors . Instead , we found that motion is largely constrained-diffusion in PSD nanodomains . The heat maps for the AMPARs labeled with sQDs ( Figure 4 ) are strikingly different from the heat maps for AMPARs labeled with bQDs ( Figure 3 ) . First , the diffusion with any of the three different linkers resulted in much slower diffusion , with a diffusion coefficients\\u00a0~\\u00a010-2 . 5 \\u03bcm2/s . Results were different depending on which linker was used with the mean diffusion constant varying from 10-2 . 41\\u00b10 . 02\\u03bcm2/s for the SA linker ( Figure 4a ) , which is largest and multivalent ( Figure 1b ) , 10-2 . 53\\u00b10 . 02\\u03bcm2/s for the GBP linker ( Figure 4b ) , which intermediate in size and monovalent and 10-2 . 59 \\u00b1 0 . 02\\u03bcm2/s for the mSA linker ( Figure 4c ) , the smallest and monovalent . These results suggest that both the size as well as the valency of the probe can influence the measurements . More specifically , these trends yield 75% ( 70% ) , 82% ( 92% ) and 84% ( 86% ) slowly moving , that\\u00a0is a vast majority of AMPAR-sQDs display constrained diffusion . ( The numbers in parenthesis correspond to taking the integrated area under the Gaussian fit ) . By looking at the diffusion constants , one sees a distribution of constrained diffusion: 84 , 100% and 96% . Both results are in direct contrast with the results for labeling with the bQDs . In addition , the diffusion constant for AMPARs linked via SA to sQD is somewhat broader than the sQD coupled to GFP via GBP , which is somewhat broader than the mSA . ( The mSA result is approximately equal to the smaller organic fluorophores\\u2014see below ) . This possibly implies that , although SA-sQDs are significantly better than the bQD to label AMPARs , smaller ligands ( like mSA ) or organic-fluorophores ( coupled via SA: see below ) are better to study synaptic receptors in neurons . We find that labeling with sQD to AMPAR is not a function of DIV , as day 14 is essentially identical to day 16 , for all three ligands used . This says that the diffusion time and trajectory is a not a function of time , and therefore that the time-dependence , possibly due to cross-linking and differential interaction with extracellular matrix , is not a problem for sQDs-AMPARs . This gives us confidence about our results with sQDs . We note that heat maps tell about the range of diffusion of AMPAR , but do not give the absolute distance from the PSD . Rather it is the trajectory range of receptors which does this ( Figure 2e\\u2013j , or Figure 3c\\u2013e , or Figure 4d\\u2013g ) . To get whether the AMPAR is labeling near or in the PSD , we plot in Figure 4f , the histogram of the distance of AMPAR from the center of Homer1c . The histogram shows that 75% of receptors are localized within 0 . 5 \\u00b5m of Homer1c and 91% within 1 . 0 \\u00b5m , generally undergoing constrained-diffusion ( Figure 2d , f ) . This strongly implies that the great majority of AMPARs are within the PSD . This further implies that our labeling strategy using the small probes does not limit access to the synaptic cleft . We also need to take into account those sQDs that are bound to AMPARs but not in a synapse . ( For the bQDs , this was 22\\u20135%=17% . ) We find that there is 12% of labeled mSA-sQD-AMPAR undergoing constrained diffusion not around a labeled Homer1c . Whether this is due to AMPAR constrained within a PSD containing an unlabeled Homer1c , or constrained within some other domain , is not known . These results are similar to AMPARs labeled with sQDs . We labeled AMPARs using SA-Atto647N or SA-CF633 ( Figure 5 ) . Both of these dyes are bright , especially when several dyes are conjugated per streptavidin , and fairly photostable , >50 s observation time ( Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . ( Why we get this enhanced photostability is unclear . ) In addition , Atto647N has a positive charge and is relatively hydrophobic , whereas CF633 is negatively charged and hydrophilic ( Zanetti-Domingues et al . , 2013 ) . Somewhat better , more specific labeling was shown with CF633 . Overall , these factors have been found to be significant in terms of the measurement of the diffusion of membrane proteins ( Zanetti-Domingues et al . , 2013 ) . A heat map shows that the diffusion constants and range of AMPARs are both quite small when labeled with Atto647N ( post-transfection day 1 and day 3 ) and CF633 ( post-transfection day 1 ) ( Figure 5a and b ) . The results for Atto647N at various concentrations ( 0 . 1\\u20131 nM ) are similar ( Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . There is a slight difference between the two dyes chosen , which indicates that CF633 might have more specific labeling . With Atto647N , fitting the trajectories regardless of the diffusion constants , there is 27% of the AMPAR which has longer trajectory range and larger diffusion constants ( Figure 5a ) ; these are not much present with the CF633 dye , where we find 93% are constrained in nanodomains ( Figure 5b ) . Finally , Figure 5c is the image of the main peak , \\u03b1 in Figure 5a , which shows that AMPAR is not just constrained , but is constrained around the PSD . Figure 5d indicates that 81% of AMPAR-SA-CF633 is localized within 0 . 5 \\u00b5m of Homer1c , and this number increases to 98% within 1 \\u03bcm . Similarly , for Atto647N , 78% is within 0 . 5 \\u00b5m and 84% within 1 \\u00b5m of Homer1c . For fixed neurons , labeled with Cy3B , the results are similar Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 3 ) : 85% of the receptors are localized within 0 . 5 \\u00b5m of Homer1c . For any of the dyes chosen , whether fixed or live , they indicate a close association between the Homer1c and AMPARs . We imaged native AMPARs labeled with antibody ( GluA2 ) -Alexa647 and measured the distance between native AMPARs and Homer1c clusters using fixed neurons which we transfected with Homer1-mGeos . As shown in Figure 5e and Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 4 , the results show that 71% of AMPARs are localized within 0 . 5 \\u03bcm , and 96% within 1 \\u03bcm . This is very similar to the Atto647N and CF633 shown in Figure 5d ( 78-98% ) . The results using endogenous AMPARs labeled with antibodies indicate that the overexpression of GluA2 does not significantly affect the measurements . The extra-cellular matrix ( ECM ) is a dense meshwork structure in surrounding brain cells ( Sykov\\u00e1 and Nicholson , 2008 ) . In neurons , surface receptors such as AMPARs and NMDARs , possibly interact directly or indirectly with the ECM , so that the ECM may affect the lateral diffusion of surface receptors in the synapses and surrounding locations ( Dityatev and Schachner , 2003 ) . Recent studies have shown that the ECM is also involved in the mechanism of recruiting glutamate receptors through lateral diffusion ( Dityatev and Schachner , 2003; Dityatev et al . , 2010; Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) ( Frischknecht and Gundelfinger , 2012 ) . In particular , one recent study claimed that when the ECM was enzymatically removed , the extra-synaptic AMPA receptors moved at a higher diffusion rate and the exchange of synaptic receptors was increased ( Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) . They therefore concluded that the ECM might regulate short-term synaptic plasticity . However , the observations were on AMPARs labeled by bQDs , so their conclusions should be re-examined in light of our results above . We therefore compared AMPARs labeled with bQDs and sQDs on untreated cultured neurons and on neurons in which ECM was removed using Hyaluronidase . Recall that with bQD , in the presence of ECM ( Figure 3a and dotted lines in Figure 6a ) , we have two populations of AMPAR-bQD: 73% are fast moving ( D\\u00a0~\\u00a010-1 . 20 \\u00b1 0 . 01\\u00a0=\\u00a00 . 063 \\u00b5m2/s ) over a large distance and 27% are slow moving ( D\\u00a0~\\u00a010-2 . 0 - 10-3 . 0 \\u00b5m2/s ) , and constrained to be approximately 0 . 5 \\u03bcm from the Homer1C . After ECM removal , we find that the slow-moving ones ( the \\u03b2 peak in Figure 3a or the white dotted line in Figure 6b ) are gone . All of the remaining AMPAR-bQDs freely diffuse outside of synapses on the membrane of dendrites . In contrast , with small qdots , we observe that the average and distribution of the diffusion coefficient of AMPA receptors was almost the same before ( Dave=0 . 015\\u00a0\\u00b1\\u00a00 . 0006 \\u00b5m2/s ) ( Figure 6b , dotted line ) and after ( Dave=0 . 013\\u00b10 . 0004 \\u00b5m2/s ) ECM removal ( Figure 6c ) . Thus , sQD-tagged AMPAR diffusion is not significantly affected by the presence of ECM , presumably because virtually all of these AMPARs are confined to PSDs where diffusion is limited by interactions with PSD scaffold proteins . Only the bQD-tagged AMPARs , which are virtually all extrasynaptic , are significantly affected by ECM . These results provide an explanation for the changes that occur in the diffusion and trajectories of the bQD-tagged AMPARs going from DIV 14 to 16 in Figure 3a and b . As the neurons develop in culture , progressively more ECM is deposited on the neuronal membrane going from DIV 14 to 16 thereby reducing AMPAR diffusion and trajectories . We find that AMPARs labeled with sQDs differ from AMPARs labeled with bQDs in being able to consistently enter synaptic clefts and nanodomains within PSDs . We observe the same behavior with AMPARs labeled with organic fluorophores . The feature that distinguishes sQDs from organic fluorophores is the significantly longer photostability of the sQDs compared to the \\u2248 1 min lifetime with the organic fluorophores . Using AMPARs labeled with sQDs we examined the stability of AMPAR nanodomains in PSDs over 15 min , exciting the sQDs for 30 s at a time , every 5 min . A previous study observed that most nanodomains were stable for up to one hour , but some nanodomains were dynamic , appearing and disappearing within minutes ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) . This other study , however , used AMPARs labeled with either organic fluorophores or recombinant fluorescent proteins , which limited the imaging to the ensemble average of AMPAR in PSDs . They were therefore unable to observe the dynamics of single receptors except for much shorter times ( <<minute ) , corresponding to the photobleaching time of organic fluorophores . Here we used sQDs to study the dynamics of the nanodomains of the same AMPAR in synapses for long periods ( from 15 min repeatedly , and up to 60 min occasionally ) of time . A total of 126 synapses were observed . As shown in Figure 7 , we first located AMPARs for 30 s , immediately followed by PSD imaging using Homer 1 c super-resolution . AMPARs were then imaged three times more , every 5 min for 15 min , and PSD imaged one final time ( Figure 7a ) . The finite photostability of the fluorescent protein prevented the Homer1c from being monitored more than this . The dendrite morphology was also imaged using a transfected near-IR FP , which fills the cytoplasm of the dendrite ( Figure 7b ) . The nanodomain of the AMPAR , which was\\u00a0~\\u00a0200 nm , remained in approximately the same position in the synapse for the entire fifteen minutes . As shown in Figure 7c and d , when imaged at the beginning ( AMPAR-red , Homer1c-green ) and the end of the fifteen-minute period ( AMPAR-blue , Homer1c-brown ) , the synapse itself had changed position only slightly . To see how much the synapse had drifted over the 15 min , we aligned the images . We first made a linear adjustment , moving both the AMPA receptor trace and the Homer1c cluster about 100 nm and we then rotated the trace and cluster 19\\u00b0 to align them ( Figure 7c ) from one perspective and from then rotated the synapse 10\\u00b0 , perpendicular to the first axis , as shown in Figure 7d . With these relatively minor adjustments , the two images of the synapse nearly perfectly overlapped ( right hand side of Figure 7c , d ) . In addition , Figure 7e shows that the shape of the trace of the AMPAR ( ~200 nm in size ) observed at 0 , 5 , 10 and 15 min , remained quite constant . This indicates that the nanodomain , defined by the constrained area of a single AMPAR , was extremely stable for the fifteen-minute measurement period . Occasionally , AMPAR nanodomains were observed to move within PSDs ( Figure 7\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Using the same protocol , the AMPAR nanodomain was first observed at the very edge of the PSD ( 0 min ) after which the nanodomain moves further within the PSD and does not move further . As shown in Figure 7\\u2014figure supplement 1 ( b\\u2013d , the shape and size of the AMPAR nanodomain changes little ( Figure 7f ) , and only the nanodomain position changed after the initial time-point . In one example we also imaged a highly mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR enter into a nanodomain in PSD ( Figure 7\\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . As shown , the AMPAR during the initial time point is widely diffusing near a spine but outside of the PSD . During the last time 15 min time-period , the same AMPAR enters a nanodomain at the edge of the PSD . These images suggest that AMPARs immediately enter nanodomains as they arrive at PSDs after which the nanodomain can reposition within the PSD to a more stable location . In summary , due to the photostability of sQDs we have been able to characterize new details of AMPAR nanodomains and find that they are stable for significant times . \\n With synaptic plasticity , the numbers of AMPARs in PSDs change . Even under basal conditions , the AMPARs are recycling and therefore constantly moving in and out of synaptic clefts and PSDs . AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis is very likely ongoing at synapses ( Greger and Esteban , 2007 ) and occurs at sites outside of spines ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012 ) or within spines away from PSDs ( Henley et al . , 2011 ) . Consequently , it is important to identify where highly mobile AMPA receptors are located . As we described above , currently the consensus viewpoint is that AMPARs enter PSDs from a highly mobile pool of AMPARs in the dendritic membrane , largely outside of the spine ( Figure 1a , beginning with route 1 ) . Other evidence indicates that the site of exocytosis is in the spine ( route 3 ) . In both cases , according to this data , a large mobile pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs originates from sites in the membrane and then diffuses into the PSD ( route 2 ) . In this study , we find very little evidence for a sizeable pool of mobile extrasynaptic receptors in or around the spines . Most of the previous evidence in support of this AMPAR pool was from studies using super-resolution bQD-tagged AMPARs ( Opazo et al . , 2012; Giannone et al . , 2010; Nair et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , we too observe this behavior with bQDs ( Figure 3 ) . However , when using when AMPARs that are tagged by significantly smaller fluorophores\\u2014sQDs or organic fluorophores ( Figures 4 and 5 ) \\u2014they are overwhelmingly in the synapse:~84\\u201397% of AMPA receptors were immobilized within PSDs and only 5\\u201316% were freely diffusing in the dendrite membrane . Consequently , we believe that bQDs are too large to enable AMPARs to enter the synaptic cleft . We therefore believe that the previous results with bQDs have been misleading . Our results are consistent with studies using a variety of techniques that have found that AMPA receptors are largely localized to synapses and a relatively small extrasynaptic pool exists . First , electrophysiology has estimated the population of receptors in the synapses as well as in the dendrites . Cottrell et al . observed the density of AMPARs by measuring the glutamate-evoked response current through glutamate stimulating in synaptic regions or in dendrites . They observed the high current signal after glutamate stimulation in synaptic regions , but very low current signal with stimulation in extra-synaptic regions . Through comparing signal strength , they concluded that less than 1% of AMPA receptors were populated in the extra-synaptic regions after synaptogenesis by 11 days ( or more ) in vitro ( DIV ) ( Cottrell et al . , 2000 ) . Second , studies using fluorescence microscopy showed that AMPARs ( MacGillavry et al . , 2013 ) were co-localized with PSD-95 in dissociated cultured neurons , indicating that they were heavily colocalized with the synaptic regions . In addition , it was reported that AMPA receptors were mostly localized at the synaptic region in hippocampal neurons ( Passafaro et al . , 2001 ) . They observed that more than 75% of AMPA receptors , both subunits GluA1 and GluA2 , were colocalized with Shank at the synaptic regions . Also , their spatial and temporal fluorescence images showed that the exocytosed receptors accumulated over time ( ~30 min ) at the synaptic regions . Third , electron microscopy ( EM ) was used to show that AMPA receptors were localized at synapses ( Kharazia et al . , 1996 ) , although they could also exist in extrasynaptic domains ( Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) , especially after synaptic excitation at exocytosis and/or endocytosis sites . All these observations indicate that most AMPARs are localized and clustered at synaptic PSDs in mature neurons . The question arises as to why we observed so few highly-mobile extrasynaptic AMPARs . One possible reason is that in our protocol we have approximately 6 min of dead time with the addition of fluorophores and their binding to cell-surface AMPARs . It is likely many of the labeled AMPARs are diffusing into PSDs during the dead time and we do not observe them . Another possibility is that once AMPARs enter PSDs their residence time there is lengthy and we do not observe AMPARs exiting from PSDs because the rate of exit is much slower compared to the time period ( usually 50 s ) we use to monitor AMPAR dynamics . We also performed experiments where we compared bQD-tagged AMPARs to sQD-tagged AMPARs with and without removing the ECM ( Figure 6 ) . In this case , only the extrasynaptic bQD-tagged AMPARs , which are largely sterically hindered from entering PSDs , were affected . Previous studies found that ECM was acting as a diffusion barrier for extrasynaptic AMPARs during their membrane diffusion from extrasynaptic sites to entry into PSDs ( Frischknecht and Gundelfinger , 2012 ) . Our data is consistent with this conclusion and also supportive of our findings that show the different localization of bQD-tagged AMPARs and sQD-tagged AMPARs . The diffusion of sQD-tagged AMPARs was not affected by enzymatic removal of the ECM because they are almost all within the PSDs away from the effects of ECM removal . Diffusion of bQD-tagged AMPARs was significantly affected because they are largely highly mobile and extrasynaptic . Our findings on the bQD-tagged AMPARs are almost identical to the previous findings of others looking at the effects of ECM removal on bQD-tagged AMPARs ( Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) . We conclude that the vast majority of AMPARs rapidly enter PSDs and are confined to sub-synaptic diffusion in nanodomains . The diffusion constant is about 10x slower than that of free extrasynaptic AMPARs . The AMPARs therefore do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously inferred in studies using AMPARs labeled with bQDs . In previous studies , the findings that AMPARs accumulate in a highly mobile pool of AMPARs in extra-synaptic dendritic membranes suggested that this AMPAR pool existed because of limits in the numbers of AMPARs that are stabilized within PSDs ( Opazo et al . , 2012 ) . According to Opazo et al . , AMPARs are not stabilized within PSDs until \\u2018slots\\u2019 , defined as PSD place-holders for AMPARs become free inside the PSD . Consequently , in this model , AMPARs build up outside of PSDs . We do not observe the highly mobile AMPAR pool when bQDs are replaced by a variety of smaller ( organic and sQDs ) fluorophores and linkers indicating that the highly mobile pool is an artifact of using bQDs attached to the AMPARs . Thus , the number of synaptic AMPARs does not appear to be limited by whether PSD slots are already occupied . The picture that emerges from our data is that after entry into PSDs , AMPARs are mobile but constrained within confined sub-synaptic nanodomains that are surprisingly stable , lasting for more than 15 min . It is likely that the AMPAR entry into PSDs is more rapid than the membrane diffusion rate to the PSDs . If this were not case , there would be accumulation of a mobile extra-synaptic pool , similar to what is observed when bQDs are attached to the AMPARs . The positioning of these nanodomains is likely critical for the AMPARs to receive glutamate from the presynaptic release sites ( Tang et al . , 2016; Jeyifous et al . , 2016 ) . Our conclusion that the number of synaptic AMPARs is not limited by whether PSD slots are occupied suggests that other factors regulate AMPAR numbers in PSDs . Potential candidates for what limits AMPAR numbers in PSDs are AMPAR exocytosis rate ( Figure 1a , route 1 ) , AMPAR endocytosis rate ( Figure 1a , route 3 ) and/or barriers such as extracellular matrix ( Figure 6 ) that regulate AMPAR membrane diffusion on the membrane ( Figure 1a , route 2 ) . \\n Experiments were performed with a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope with a Nikon APO 100 X objective ( N . A . 1 . 49 ) . The microscope stabilizes the sample in z-axis with the Perfect Focus System . An Agilent laser system MLC400B with four fiber-coupled lasers ( 405 nm , 488 nm , 561 nm and 640 nm ) was used for illumination . Elements software from Nikon was used for data acquisition . A back illuminated EMCCD ( Andor DU897 ) was used for recording . For 3-D imaging , a cylindrical lens ( CVI Melles Griot , SCX-25 . 4-5000 . 0- C-425-675 ) of 10 m focal length was inserted below the back aperture of the objective . A motorized stage from ASI with a Piezo top plate ( ASI PZ-2000FT ) was used for x-y-z position control . A quad-band dichroic ( Chroma , ZT405-488-561-640RPC ) was used and band-pass emission filter 525/50 , 600/50 , 710/40 , 641/75 was used for fluorescence imaging . Stage drift is a significant problem in taking super-resolution images . As we reported earlier ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) , making fiduciary-marked patterns on coverslips is a very efficient method to correct stage drift instead of using the previously favored fluorescent beads and gold nano-particles as fiduciary markers to correct stage drift . The perfectly stable fiduciary-marked patterns proved far superior to correct stage drift since it is impossible to perfectly immobilize beads or nano-particles on a coverslip surface , making it especially difficult to image live cells . More importantly , randomly spreading beads or nano-particles is a critical drawback for using them as fiduciary markers because it needs optimal number of fiduciary markers in the region of interest , whereas our fiduciary markers are a uniform pattern . Thus , the fluorescent beads and gold nanoparticles that have typically been used to correct stage drift are not effective , especially when imaging live cells . We have previously reported that mammalian cells can be stably cultured on fiduciary-marked coverslips without any other coating or treatment; however , although we had no problems taking super-resolution images of mammalian cells with this fiduciary pattern , we were not able to culture dissociated neurons on fiduciary-patterned coverslips . In general , poly- ( L/D ) -lysine coating is necessary to culture dissociated neurons on glass coverslips because the cell membranes of neurons are negatively charged . Poly-lysine coating is not sufficient for neurons to adhere the fiduciary marker coverslips . We then employed laminin to coat coverslips . As shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 3 ( a ) , we first coated poly-lysine after treating coverslips in oxygen plasma and then applied an additional coating of laminin on the fiduciary-patterned coverslips . We found that dissociated neurons could be stably cultured on fiduciary-patterned coverslips after coating them with both poly-lysine and laminin , sequentially , as in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 3 ( b ) . In terms of connection between neurons , we could obtain comparably good neurons on the fiduciary marked coverslip as we could culture them on the poly-lysine coated coverslip . More details to coat poly-lysine and laminin on the fiduciary marked coverslips were described in the method section . As shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 3 ( b\\u2013d ) , once neurons have been stably cultured on fiduciary-patterned coverslips , they can then be successfully transfected . Furthermore , IR illumination , as shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 3 ( b ) , is effective to allow clear observation of uniformly patterned fiduciary markers without affecting the visibility of fluorescence color channels . Hence , these coated fiduciary patterned coverslips are very useful to exclude stage drift , allowing for the culture , transfection , and super-resolution imaging and tracking of live neurons . Here , to demonstrate the method for taking super-resolution fluorescence images , neurons were transfected with two plasmids , one allowing expression of the post-synaptic protein homer1 with a photoactivable fluorescence protein , mGeos or mEOS3 . 2 , and the other allowing expression of glutamate receptors , AMPARs with AP tag to biotinylate . We then labeled the glutamate receptors using qdots conjugated with either streptavidin or anti-GFP nanobodies . As shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 3 ( c ) , at 530 nm\\u00a0~\\u00a0700 nm of emission in wavelength , we observed fluorescence from the proteins and receptors without any auto-fluorescence from the fiduciary pattern . We could clearly observe the fiduciary pattern in the IR channel and the live cells in the visible channels , as shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 3 ( d ) . Fiduciary markers in the IR image are tracked , fitting the fiduciary markers using either the Gaussian or the Airy function . The IR camera electronically synchronizes with the visible camera so that the traces of fiduciary markers as recorded by the IR camera accurately calculates the stage drift at the time the cells are imaged . We can then correct the super-resolution cell images for stage drift accordingly . The fiduciary marker trace corresponds to the stage drift . Thus , through this post-processing , we can correct for stage drift . Since fiduciary markers are stationary , stage drift can be much more accurately calculated using them than when using more conventional existing methods of calculating stage drift with fluorescent beads or gold nano-particles . As shown in Figure 6 , using fiduciary markers , stage drift can be controlled within an error of around 1 nm for x and y and 15 nm for z . Another technical difficulty is chromatic aberration . The three-dimensional multi-color super-resolution imaging technique allows us to observe the interaction between two different species/types of proteins or organelles in cells; however , the color shifts that occur in different color channels is a concern to take images can be even more pronounced and problematic in super resolution images different color channels . These color shifts will cause the images to be slightly different . Even though we observe exactly the same object at different color channels , the images will be a little mismatched in different color channels . Since the refractive index of light depends on its wavelength , this chromatic aberration causes focus on an object to be detected in a little different place in each color channel . This means that we have to correct this difference chromatic aberration for studying the interaction between different proteins or organelles when using multi-color super-resolution imaging . Most commercially available objective lenses are designed to optically minimize chromatic aberration . Based on our measurements , this optical design for objective lenses will corrects within the margin of error of about 100 nm; however , given that the spatial resolution of super-resolution microscopy is only about 20\\u00a0~\\u00a030 nm , a margin of the error of 100 nm is a significant error . This means that achromatic optical design is not sufficient to correct chromatic aberration , especially in super-resolution imaging . Using our method , chromatic aberration can be corrected within a margin of error of 2 nm . We accomplish this with as reported ( DeWitt et al . , 2012; Pertsinidis et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . In order to correct chromatic aberration , we made a nano-hole pattern on a silver- coated coverslip . Using a thermal evaporator , a glass coverslip is coated with silver at a thickness of about 100 nm using a thermal evaporator . The nanohole pattern is produced by fast ion beam ( FIB ) equipment , sputtering holes of about 100 nm in size every 1 . 5 \\u03bcm . Holes are about 100 nm in diameter and are located every 1 . 5 \\u03bcm . We took images for the nanoholes on three at the different color channels . As shown in supporting figure Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 7 ( a\\u2013d ) , the positions of the nanohole patterns are slightly different on each color channel . In Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 7 ( d ) , the red and green spots are the nanoholes in the green channel and in one of two red channels , shown by zooming in on the image of the the overlaid two color images . The significantly different position of the two sets of nanohole patterns is a result of shows the positions of red and green spots are significantly different , which is caused by chromatic aberration . We measured the chromatic aberration between the green ( GFP ) 530\\u00a0nm channel and red ( RFP ) 600\\u00a0nm\\u00a0channel and 705\\u00a0nm\\u00a0channels . As shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) , the\\u00a0average difference in the location of the nanoholes in between two the nanohole pattern on channels 530\\u00a0nm and 600\\u00a0nm is about 80 nanometers . We found a similar range for the difference between nanohole locations in any two of the three-color channels . This means that , when obtaining multi-color super-resolution images , the error of co-localizations of any two colors is expected possible to be at least approximately 80 nm . Furthermore , we also evaluated the validity of the mapping functions for 3D imaging . We obtained the mapping function at a focal point of z\\u00a0=\\u00a00 , focal point , with an error of 2 nm , and , as shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) , this mapping function can be applied is valid up to within z=\\u00a0\\u00b1400 nm with an error of only 4 nm . when the error is 2 nm at z\\u00a0=\\u00a00 . Actually , we obtained the mapping function at z=200 nm , 400 nm , 600 nm , and 800 nm and , as represented in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) , the error is a little smaller than when using the mapping function obtained at z\\u00a0=\\u00a00; however , since a 3 D super-resolution image using astigmatism is not discrete along the z axis , it is not easy to have mapping functions along the z axis . At focal points above 400 nm , the error dramatically increased . We obtained the mapping function at z\\u00a0=\\u00a0200 nm , 400 nm , 600 nm , and 800 nm , as represented in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) . At focal points above 400 nm , the error dramatically increased . Although the error is a little smaller at focal points higher on the z axis than when using the mapping function obtained at z=0 , we conclude that when getting 3D images using astigmatism , the mapping function at z=0 is accurate enough to correct chromatic aberration . This is because a 3 D super-resolution image using astigmatism is not discrete along the z axis . Hence , it would be too time consuming to try to obtain more accurate mapping functions all along the z axis . Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from E18 rats according to UIUC guidelines as previous described ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) with the following modifications . In brief , hippocampal tissues were dissociated in 3 mg/mL protease and plated on 25 mm coverslips coated with 1 mg/mL poly-l-lysine and laminin . Neurons were cultured at 37\\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in neurobasal media ( ThermoFisher , 21103049 ) with B-27 supplement ( GIBCO ) , 2 \\u03bcM glutmax and 50 unit/mL penicillin and 50 unit/ml streptomycin . On 12\\u201313 days in vitro ( DIV ) , neurons were co-transfected with Homer1c-mGeos ( 1 \\u03bcg/coverslip ) with GluA2-AP ( 1 \\u03bcg/coverslip ) and BirA-ER ( 1 \\u03bcg/coverslip ) , and Homer1c-mGeos ( 1 \\u03bcg/coverslip ) for AMPA receptors by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent . At 24\\u00a0~\\u00a072 hr after transfection , the coverslips were transferred to warm imaging buffer ( HBSS supplemented with 10 mM Hepes , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 . 2 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM D-glucose ) for 5 min incubation and mounted onto an imaging dish ( Warner RC-40LP ) . In the imaging dish , neurons were incubated in imaging buffer containing QDs and casein ( ~400 times dilution for bQDs , and\\u00a0~80 times dilution for sQDs; stock solution purchased from Vector labs , SP-5020 ) for 5 min at 30\\u00b0C and washed with 10 ml of imaging buffer . Finally , 3 mL of imaging buffer was added to the imaging dish that was subsequently mounted on the microscope . For ECM removal , we enzymatically removed the ECM using hyaluronidase ( HX0514 \\u2013 Calbiochem , 100 units/ml left overnight at 37\\u00b0 with 5% CO2 ) . For labeling endogenous AMPARs using antibody , we conjugated Alexa647 NHS ester ( Thermo-Fisher: A37573 , Waltham , MA ) with anti-GluR2 ( Anti-Glutamate Receptor 2 Antibody , extracellular , clone 6C4: Sigma-Aldrich: MAB397 , St . Louis , MO ) To express mSA , E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS was transformed with an appropriate expression vector and plated on Luria Bertani ( LB ) agar containing ampicillin . Several colonies were selected from the plate for overnight growth at 37\\u00b0C in an LB starter culture containing 200 \\u03bcg/ml ampicillin . The following morning , the starter culture was diluted 100 fold into Terrific Broth ( TB ) containing 0 . 05% glucose , 0 . 5% glycerol , 0 . 2% \\u03b1-lactose , 1 mM MgSO4 , 900 \\u03bcM biotin , and 200 \\u03bcg/ml ampicillin . The cells were grown at 37\\u00b0C and 300 rpm until OD600 reached 0 . 3 , at which point the shaker temperature was reduced to 20\\u00b0C . Once the culture has reached OD600=0 . 6 , IPTG was added to the final concentration of 75 \\u03bcM and the shaker speed was increased to 375 rpm . After 24 hr induction at 20\\u00b0C , cells were removed by centrifugation and the culture medium containing secreted mSA was collected for purification . The medium was sonicated with a 200 W sonicator ( 30 s on , 30 s off for 4 cycles at 50% amplitude capacity ) . The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 7 . 5 using NaOH and imidazole was added to 10 mM . The medium was then centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 20 min to remove any precipitates . The clarified medium was passed through a column packed with Ni-NTA Superflow Agarose pre-equilibrated in PBS and 10 mM imidazole . The column was then washed with PBS and 20 mM imidazole . Finally , the bound protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole in PBS . The eluted protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged to 100 mM glycine buffer pH 2 . 3 using a centrifugal filter to remove bound biotin . Finally , the sample was buffer exchanged to PBS . Yields were estimated based on A280 measurements and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining . All streptavidin homologs have a conserved three dimensional structure , but differences in the binding pocket residues lead to differences in biotin binding . For example , the main chain root mean squared deviation between mSA and streptavidin is 0 . 82 \\u00c5 but there is\\u00a0~105 fold difference in their binding affinities . Although extremely high affinity is not needed for labeling live cells , rapid dissociation of bound biotin interferes with detection and measurement because it results in loss of fluorescence intensity over time . As such , improving the dissociation kinetics ( i . e . slowing the off rate koff ) of mSA is important to develop a useful imaging reagent . We have previously demonstrated that replacing S25 with histidine reduces koff by 7 . 5 fold by blocking solvent entry into the binding pocket through steric hindrance ( Demonte et al . , 2013 ) . Keeping water molecules out of the binding pocket is important because they compete with mSA-biotin hydrogen bonds and lead to biotin dissociation . S25 is located in the loop between \\u03b2\\u2212strands 1 and 2 ( L1 , 2 ) , which is found at the subunit interface of streptavidin but is solvent exposed in mSA . Therefore , blocking solvent entry in mSA in part involves recreating the lost physical barrier near L1 , 2 . To improve the dissociation kinetics further , we modeled the binding pocket of mSA using high affinity dimer bradavidin II ( Brad2 ) , which binds biotin with Kd\\u00a0<10\\u221210 M ( Helppolainen et al . , 2008 ) . L1 , 2 and the binding loop L3 , 4 adopt nearly identical conformations in mSA and Brad2 , thus allowing key residues to be reliably modeled in mSA . The Brad2 residue corresponding to mSA S25 is R17 , which makes a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with G103 and D104 , respectively , to form a solvent barrier around L1 , 2 as shown in Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 1 ( a , b ) . Arginine is larger than serine and histidine and is therefore more effective in blocking solvent entry . To reconstruct the solvent barrier in mSA , we mutated S25 to R , and measured the dissociation rate of the mutant mSA using fluorescence polarization spectroscopy . The dissociation rate of mSA-S25R is slower than that of mSA or mSA-S25H . Brad2 also contains F42 in L3 , 4 to create a hydrophobic lid over bound biotin and trap the molecule in the binding pocket . Mutating F42 to alanine significantly reduces the affinity of interaction , indicating that the hydrophobic lid also plays an important role in biotin binding . We therefore introduced the corresponding mutation T48F in mSA-S25R to create a hydrophobic binding pocket and further reduce the dissociation rate . The measured koff of mSA-S25R/T48F ( mSA-RF ) is 37 fold lower compared to original mSA , that\\u00a0is . t\\u00bd=402 min , and\\u00a0~5 fold lower than the best mutant to date , thst\\u00a0is mSA-S25H ( Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 1c ) . The single point mutant mSA-T48F resulted in only limited improvement in biotin dissociation ( t\\u00bd=13 min ) , indicating that the two mutations function cooperatively . We also tested an alternative design of the hydrophobic lid with a tryptophan , mSA-S25R/T48W/D124T ( or mSA-RWT ) , which had similarly slow dissociation kinetics , t\\u00bd=330 min ( Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 1c ) . Therefore , construction of solvent barriers through cooperative mutations in L1 , 2 and L3 , 4 can modulate the dissociation kinetics and improve the mSA-biotin interaction . To demonstrate the use of new engineered mSA in cell labeling , we expressed a biotin acceptor peptide ( AP ) fused to CFP and a transmembrane helix ( TM ) on the surface of HEK293 . We then added purified E . coli biotin ligase , BirA , to the cell culture to induce site-specific biotinylation of AP . The cells were fixed and labeled with mSA-RF\\u2014EGFP for imaging by confocal microscopy . The CFP positive cells were selectively labeled , suggesting high specificity of interaction between mSA-RF and biotin ( Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 1d and e ) . Furthermore , the intensity of EGFP fluorescence remained high after 1 hr , indicating that the interaction is stable and mSA-RF remained stably bound during measurement . In order to verify whether SA-qdots were in fact cross-linking , we compared the diffusion coefficient of mSA-qdots and SA-qdots on the lipid bilayer at different concentrations ( 0 . 2% and 1 . 0% ) of biotinylated lipid molecules . If a qdot binds to one biotinylated lipid molecule , the resulting labeled lipid molecule will diffuse at the same rate as a free diffusion of a lipid molecule; whereas , if a qdot binds to multiple biotinylated lipid molecules , the diffusion rate will significantly slow down as shown in Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 2 . We first determined whether there is any difference in the diffusion rate of molecules labeled in three ways: ( 1 ) those labeled with normal SA-qdot conjugates formed with big qdots ( one conjugate has many streptavidin and numerous binding site on SA-big qdots ) ; ( 2 ) those labeled with normal SA-qdot conjugates formed with small qdots ( one conjugate has four binding sites from the streptavidin ) ; and ( 3 ) those labeled with mSA-qdot conjugates using monomeric streptavidin and small qdots ( one conjugate has only one binding site ) . We hypothesized that normal streptavidin conjugates with both small and big qdots would be much more likely to bind multiple biotins than would be the case with mSA conjugates . We found this to be the case , as represented in Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 3 . Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 3 shows that there was little difference in the diffusion rate of molecules labeled with normal SA-qdots , whether conjugated with small or big qdots: there were a large number of slow diffusive qdots for both normal streptavidin conjugates , indicating that they had cross-linked to multiple molecules , even at the 0 . 2% biotin concentration shown in Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 3 . At 1 . 0% biotin , there was even a larger population of slow diffusive qdots , that\\u00a0is , cross-linked qdots . By contrast , in the case of mSA qdot conjugates , we found that most qdot conjugates were freely diffusive at 0 . 2% as well as at 1 . 0% biotin concentration; that is , mSA-qdots do not show a slow diffusive population of labeled molecules at either 0 . 2% or 1 . 0% concentrations . These observations showed that normal streptavidin frequently cross-links to multiple molecules while monomeric streptavidin did not . In order to further examine cross-linking of normal and monomeric streptavidin , we compared the run length of kinesin ( K432 , biotin at C-terminus ) . It is well known that when the cargo ( in this case the streptavidin-qdot conjugate ) binds to multiple motor proteins , the cargo will be transported over a longer distance than when the cargo binds to a single motor protein . ( Beeg et al . , 2008; Furuta et al . , 2013 ) A single motor protein transports cargo approximately 1 um , while multiple motor proteins can walk farther than 1 um . Thus , if we compare the run length of kinesin using SA-qdots and mSA-qdots at different ratios of kinesin and qdots , then we can examine the possibility that one qdot is binding to multiple proteins versus binding to a single protein . For accuracy of labeling , we want to confirm that binding is to a single protein and a shorter kinesin run length will indicate this . In the case of mSA-qdots , we found the run length was the same as that of a single kinesin at a ratio of 2:1 ( two kinesin molecules to one qdot ) . As expected ( Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , the run length was not changed even when the ratio of kinesin to qdots was increased to 6:1 . This means that mSA-qdots do not bind to multiple motor proteins . By contrast , in the case of SA-qdots , the run length of kinesin was more than the typical run length of kinesin , as shown in Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 4 . Even at a ratio of 2:1 , the histogram of run lengths shows that some kinesin walked longer than the typical kinesin run length . At 6:1 , we found that the run length significantly increased , indicating cross-linking . These results mirror the results we obtained in our first experiment about diffusion rates of labeled molecules in the lipid bilayer . After focusing the sample in bright field , the Perfect Focus System was activated to minimize the sample drift in z direction . The samples were then scanned in the GFP channel ( 488 excitation , 525/50 emission ) to locate transfected cells . A fluorescent image of the cells was taken for reference . To track the QD labeled receptors , 488 nm or 561 nm lasers was used for excitation in the hi-low-fluorescence mode with an appropriate band-pass filter for collecting the fluorescence . In terms of localization precision of fluorophores , as shown in Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 8 , organic dyes were about 11\\u00a0~\\u00a021 nm for x and y ( Atto647N \\u2013 12 nm for both x and y ) and CF633- 21 nm for x and 12 nm for y ) and about 32 nm ( Atto 647N ) /42 nm ( CF633 ) for z . Qdots were 9 . 6 nm for x , 8 . 2 nm for y , and 18 nm for z . After the tracking experiment , the PALM ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ) experiment was carried out on the same neurons . PALM was used for super-resolution of post-synaptic density . Post-synaptic protein Homer1c was used as the PSD marker and its C- terminus was fused to photoactivatable protein mGeos . A 100 ms 405 nm laser pulse was used to activate mGeos proteins from dark to green fluorescent state . The sample was then excited with a 488 nm read out laser and emission was collected with a 535/50 band-pass filter . The cycle was repeated for 200\\u2013300 times , collecting 4000\\u20136000 frames . The z calibration was created following method described by Huang et al . ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) using fluorescent beads on a glass surface and applied to both tracking and PALM data . Cy3B-STORM was done following the procedure described on Joshua et al ( Vaughan et al . , 2012 ) . We labeled neurons with Cy3B-SA ( 2 \\u03bcM ) following the procedure of sQD labeling . We then fixed the cells with a solution of 4% PFA and 0 . 1% Glutaraldehyde in HBSS for 10 min . Wash with three tines PBS . Treat the sample with 10 mM of NaBH4 in PBS freshly prepared for 10 min . Wash with PBS . Before imaging , we add imaging buffer consisting of 5 \\u03bcL of PCD , 20 \\u03bcL of PCA , 4 \\u03bcL of Trolox in 471 \\u03bcL of T-100 ( 100 mM Tris at pH 8 . 0 ) . Images were acquired at 10 Hz using 405 nm laser at low power to do activation and 561 nm laser to excite fluorescence . In order to image native AMPARs , we labeled AMPARs using Anti-GluA2-Alexa647 after fixation . For STORM imaging , we added imaging buffer consisting of 5 mM MEA ( Sigma: 30070 , St . Louis , MO ) solution ( ~pH 8 . 0 ) and additionally added 40 mM Sodium D/L-lactate ( Sigma: 71720 , St . Louis , MO ) and EC-Oxyrase ( Sigma: SAE0010 , St . Louis , MO ) in PBS in order to improve the photo-stability . For the tracking data , centroids of the all the QDs were localized in all the frames and a map of all the places QDs visited were obtained . A Matlab code was used to recover the trajectories of the QDs . In brief , the code finds locations of QDs in time t , and searches for nearby QDs in time t+1 as the next point on the trajectory . In the 3-D single particle tracking experiment , the maximum displacement of a QD in one time step is set to be 1 \\u03bcm . The trajectory range was obtained by calculating the range of the trajectory in the x- , y- , and z- direction , and using the maximum of the three parameters . The diffusion coefficients from the trajectories were calculated in Matlab by fitting the first 4 points of mean-square-displacement curve . For the PALM data , positions of proteins detected in each frame are localized , cluster analysis was used for identify synapses . To determine if a trajectory was synaptic , the centers of synapses were determined , and trajectories within 2 \\u03bcm radius of each synapse were identified . For each of these trajectories , the average distance was calculated between the center of the nearest synapse and all points on the trajectory . Any trajectories with an average distance smaller than 0 . 55 \\u03bcm were considered synaptic . The visualizations of post-synaptic densities and sQD labeled AMPA/NMDA receptor tracking trajectories were created using VMD 1 . 9 . 2 ( Humphrey et al . , 1996 ) , a widely-used program for visualizing and analyzing macromolecular structures and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation trajectories . VMD is optimized for dealing with large data sets containing millions of particles and thousands of trajectory frames , as encountered in the current study .\",\n          \"Mature neural networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal activity patterns to support cognition . Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated , but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown . We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice . We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development . The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence , after which spatially distributed , temporally precise , and internally organized activity occurs . We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans , suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation . We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks . \\n Multiple cognitive functions emerge rapidly during early development . Neural networks enable precise spatiotemporal coordination of synaptic and cellular activity in mature brain functions ( Fries et al . , 1997; Maingret et al . , 2016; Peyrache et al . , 2009; Khodagholy et al . , 2017 ) . How immature neural networks develop into their mature form needed for the complex computations underlying cognition remains poorly understood . The first organized and predominant pattern of neural activity that appears in cortical circuits across species is a spindle-like oscillation ( 10\\u201320 Hz ) that occurs intermittently on a background of relative neural inactivity . Known as spindle bursts in rodents and delta brushes in humans , this immature network activity is commonly triggered by peripheral stimuli ( An et al . , 2014; Hanganu et al . , 2006; Khazipov et al . , 2004 ) . They demarcate cortical columns or pre-columns and have been linked to neuronal survival ( Golbs et al . , 2011 ) , establishing sensory ensembles , and critical period plasticity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Colonnese et al . , 2010; Khazipov et al . , 2013; Winnubst et al . , 2015 ) . Spindle bursts are characteristic of the first postnatal week of rodent development , and delta brushes disappear shortly after term in human neonates ( Torres and Anderson , 1985 ) , emphasizing their transient role in network maturation . In contrast , mature cortex exhibits perpetual , complex patterns of neural activity that appear and interact across a wide range of frequencies ( Tort et al . , 2009; Fujisawa and Buzs\\u00e1ki , 2011; Bosman et al . , 2012 ) . The organization of this activity creates precise spatiotemporal windows for neural synchronization , enabling plasticity processes and generation of neural sequences ( Masquelier et al . , 2009; Geisler et al . , 2010; Foster and Wilson , 2006 ) . Such network properties facilitate information processing , and resultant activity patterns have been causally linked to cognitive processes from stimulus perception to learning and memory ( Fries et al . , 1997; Maingret et al . , 2016; Peyrache et al . , 2009; Khodagholy et al . , 2017 ) . Understanding when and how these properties develop in the immature brain is critical given that delay or failure to express mature brain activity is a strong risk factor for subsequent impaired cognition ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Anderson et al . , 1985; Seelke and Blumberg , 2008; Holmes and Lombroso , 1993 ) . We hypothesized that emergence of these advanced neural network properties could be heralded by the disappearance of immature activity patterns . During this developmental epoch , cortical microcircuits are still undergoing dramatic changes in anatomical connectivity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004 ) and functional connectivity between and within cortical layers is initiated ( Bureau et al . , 2004 ) in part through an abrupt increase in synaptogenesis in superficial layers ( Naskar et al . , 2019 ) . Robust GABA-mediated fast inhibition also appears ( Daw et al . , 2007; Goldberg et al . , 2011 ) as inhibitory network influences of interneurons increase ( Modol et al . , 2020; Tuncdemir et al . , 2016; Favuzzi et al . , 2019 ) . These local circuit changes are paralleled with the gradual ingrowth of subcortical neurotransmitters that assist in setting brain state changes . Together , such modifications could prime a shift in network operating mode , setting the stage for re-emergence of a different oscillation that occupies a similar frequency band , thalamocortical sleep spindles . In contrast to spindle bursts , these oscillations are characteristic of the offline state of non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep only , and they facilitate memory consolidation ( Maingret et al . , 2016; Latchoumane et al . , 2017 ) . To investigate this hypothesis , we examined neural network dynamics across early rodent and human development . We targeted epochs spanning disappearance of immature activity and emergence of mature sleep patterns in each species . For rodents , we developed conformable , minimally invasive , high-resolution electrocorticography arrays coupled with high-density implantable probes and recorded spontaneous in vivo electrophysiological patterns from unanesthetized mice across the first two postnatal weeks . This approach enabled simultaneous recording of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity without damaging fragile cortical circuits . We found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was characterized by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week . After this timepoint , precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged . Analysis of continuous electroencephalography ( EEG ) recordings from human subjects , 36\\u201369 weeks post-gestation , revealed a similar developmental trajectory characterized by a transient decrease in neural activity prior to onset of spatiotemporal oscillatory coupling . Therefore , a shift from local , loosely correlated , prominently sensory-driven patterns to internally organized , spatially distributed , and temporally precise activity is preceded by a transient quiescent period . These findings suggest that mechanisms to developmentally regulate functional network capacity may be evolutionarily conserved and manifest on the systems level as similar , discrete states . \\n To identify and characterize emergence of advanced neural network properties in the developing brain , we acquired high spatiotemporal resolution electrophysiological recordings from somatosensory cortex of unanesthetized mouse pups aged postnatal day ( P ) 5 to 14 ( n = 108 pups ) , an epoch that spans the transition from immature to mature activity patterns during sleep . We used minimally invasive surface electrocorticography arrays ( NeuroGrids , n = 70 pups ) to permit a spatially extensive survey of cortex . These customized NeuroGrids ( Khodagholy et al . , 2015 ) consisted of 119 electrodes regularly spaced on a diagonal square-centered lattice embedded in 4-\\u00b5m-thick parylene C to conform to the cortical surface ( Figure 1A ) . Recordings were made following recovery from surgery to eliminate any influence of anesthesia ( Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1 and Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Mice at these ages enter into a cyclical pattern of sleep and wakefulness as assayed by peripheral indicators , such as muscular tone , movements , and heart rate ( Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We ensured electrodes used for analysis were located in somatosensory cortex by postmortem histology . Following NeuroGrid recordings , the location of the array was marked on the surface of the brain using a biocompatible fluorescent material ( Rauhala et al . , 2020 ) and tissue was harvested for immunohistochemistry . vGlut2 staining identified the location of primary somatosensory and visual cortices relative to NeuroGrid placement on flattened axial slices ( Figure 1B , upper ) , and the spatially extensive nature of the array compared to the size of the pups\\u2019 brains further facilitated anatomical targeting . This histology-based electrode grouping corresponded to spatial localization of electrophysiological activity patterns , identifying electrodes recording from somatosensory cortex ( Figure 1B , lower; Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . To additionally capture neural spiking patterns across cortical layers , we stereotactically implanted silicon probes ( linear electrode arrangement ) in somatosensory cortex of a separate cohort ( n = 38 pups ) . Immunohistochemistry of coronal slices from these brains verified probe placement within somatosensory cortex , permitted allocation of recording electrodes to cortical layers ( Figure 1C , upper ) , and demonstrated transcortical neural spiking patterns ( Figure 1C , lower; Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . We expected that physiologically significant features of neural network maturation would be conserved across species . Thus , in parallel , we obtained continuous EEG recordings from normal human subjects 36\\u201369 weeks post-gestation ( 1 day\\u00a0to\\u00a07 months after birth ) , an epoch that similarly spans the transition from immature to mature activity patterns of human sleep and can be mapped to corresponding timepoints of rodent brain development ( Jouvet-Mounier et al . , 1969; Clancy et al . , 2001; Milh et al . , 2007 ) . We first identified epochs of artifact-free behavioral immobility consistent with sleep in the pups ( Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 5 ) and compared the activity present with human sleep EEG . Sleep in the youngest mouse pups ( P5\\u20137 ) was characterized by irregular , discontinuous bursts of neural activity ( Figure 1D , E , upper traces ) . The predominant activity was organized into spindle bursts , oscillations characteristic of developing rodent sensory cortex ( Figure 1D , left spectrogram ) . Sleep in the youngest human subjects recorded was also discontinuous , and contained delta brushes , an oscillatory pattern that develops by 26 weeks post-gestation and disappears around 40\\u201344 weeks ( Khazipov and Luhmann , 2006;\\u00a0Figure 1E , left spectrogram ) . Delta brushes share morphological and frequency characteristics with spindle bursts . Sleep patterns changed profoundly with maturation in both species . More mature mouse pups exhibited nearly continuous patterns during sleep , an absence of spindle bursts , and the appearance of sleep spindles , which are well-characterized oscillations of NREM sleep ( Figure 1D , lower trace , right spectrogram ) . Human sleep was similarly continuous , and sleep spindles appear during NREM between 1\\u00a0and\\u00a02 months after term in infants ( Figure 1E , lower trace , right spectrogram ) . This mature sleep in rodents and humans is predominantly governed by internally generated dynamics ( Levenstein et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast , self-generated or evoked movements during sleep are closely associated with local field potential ( LFP ) activity in somatosensory cortex of immature rodents and humans ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Dooley et al . , 2020 ) . We confirmed that the association between muscular twitches and changes in LFP power ( Figure 1F; n = 6716 twitches from n = 52 pups , sampled randomly to ensure uniform group size; Kruskal\\u2013Wallis ANOVA , chi-square = 12 . 93 , p=0 . 0048 ) or detectable spindle band oscillations ( Figure 1G; cross-correlation of twitches and spindle band oscillations exceeded 95% confidence interval , black dashed lines , only in pups aged P5\\u20137 ) decreased as the pups matured . These marked similarities in the electrophysiological features of neural activity during sleep across development suggest the possibility of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of neural network maturation . To investigate how this maturation occurs , we examined the macrostructure of sleep LFP with fine temporal precision over early pup development ( P5\\u201314 ) . Mature sleep can be classified into distinct stages ( NREM and REM ) based on electrophysiological criteria , but these indicators do not reliably differentiate the immature analogues of these states ( quiet and active sleep , respectively ) until after P11 ( Seelke and Blumberg , 2008 ) . Therefore , we focused on periods of behavioral and EMG quiescence that lasted for longer than 10 s ( Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 5 ) , with the goal of preferentially analyzing the transition of quiet sleep ( which contains spindle bursts ) into NREM sleep ( which contains sleep spindles ) . Unexpectedly , recordings across development revealed an epoch of relative neural quiescence at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 2A ) that corresponded to decreased spectral power and absence of prominent activity at physiological frequencies ( Figure 2B , Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We hypothesized that this quiescence could be related to a transient decrease in the continuity of the neural signal or the power of the activity that was present . Continuity of neural activity was quantified by determining the duration of neural activity above the wideband noise floor . Although continuity increased markedly from the youngest to most mature animals , we found a decrease in the duration of continuous neural activity that corresponded to the identified period of spectral quiescence ( Figure 2C ) . When we extracted the average wideband power of the continuous activity that was present at each developmental day , there was also a transient nadir at this timepoint ( Figure 2D ) . Because we aimed to characterize the trajectory of the electrophysiological features over time without making a priori assumptions about the nature of the temporal relationship or the rate of change , we employed a modeling approach that considered age as a continuous variable . This approach avoided arbitrary grouping of data from different aged pups without sacrificing statistical power and enabled characterization of the developmental profile beyond testing at individual timepoints . Data were fit with linear and polynomial regression models , and model performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation ( LOOCV ) to avoid overfitting ( Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Polynomial regression provided the best fit for continuity and power data as quantified by the mean squared error ( MSE; Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . In addition , linear regression was insufficient to model these parameters because linear fit residuals systematically deviated from zero and consistently overestimated observed values at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . The best fit models exhibited local minima , and to estimate the age at which these nadirs occurred , we employed a bootstrapping method . Bootstrapping data within each developmental day localized probability of nadir in continuity and power at the beginning of the second postnatal week with likelihood far exceeding the distribution obtained by bootstrapping across days ( Figure 2C , D inset , Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 2D\\u2013F , Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . We tested the possibility that the quiescence could be related to a shift in proportion of time spent in each sleep state , a decrease in self-generated sleep movements , or differential recovery from anesthesia across ages . In keeping with previous observations , the proportion of active relative to quiet sleep decreased gradually with maturation ( Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 4A ) and we also found a trend toward fewer self-generated sleep movements in the more mature animals , though this shift was not statistically significant ( Figure 2\\u2014figure supplement 4B ) . Recovery from anesthesia was determined individually for each pup , and there was no difference in post-anesthesia stability of oscillation occurrence rate or neural spiking across pups ( Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The absence of a marked shift in any of these features during the observed quiescent period makes them unlikely drivers of the phenomenon . Therefore , sleep LFP macrostructure expresses a nonlinear pattern of development that is characterized by a discrete period of relative neural quiescence occurring at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Rate and synchrony of neural spiking strongly contribute to expression of LFP patterns . We hypothesized that changes in neural spiking patterns could accompany the transient quiescent period . Spiking activity was detected in recordings obtained using implantable silicon probes from two non-contiguous sites ( >200 \\u00b5m vertical separation ) within the deep layers of cortex ( IV\\u2013VI ) and one site within the superficial layers of cortex ( I\\u2013III ) per pup recording ( n = 38 pups ) . We first calculated rates of neural spiking only during epochs of above-threshold LFP activity to eliminate effects related to LFP discontinuity . We found that neural spiking increased nonlinearly over the course of development , again with a significant nadir at the beginning of the second postnatal week as quantified using a bootstrapping method ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These data suggest that lowered intracortical synaptic drive could contribute to the nadir in LFP patterns at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Consistent spiking within neuronal integration time is critical for plasticity processes ( Mainen and Sejnowski , 1995 ) . To estimate this property , we calculated the inter-spike\\u00a0interval ( ISI ) between each unique action potential . ISI duration decreased nonlinearly across development , with the longest ISI duration occurring in pups at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Population neural spiking at fine time scales is thus both transiently decreased and desynchronized at this time in both superficial and deep cortical layers , resulting in a brief period of relative quiescence prior to the progressive increase in spiking rate and synchrony that accompany subsequent maturation . During mature NREM sleep , there is alternation between periods of neural spiking and hyperpolarization that serves to synchronize neural populations and is implicated in memory consolidation ( Ji and Wilson , 2007; Steriade et al . , 1993 ) . We examined population spiking dynamics in the developing cortex by computing the autocorrelation of spiking activity , which permits quantification of neural synchrony over durations relevant to this slow oscillation ( Figure 3C ) . Significant short time scale ( <50 ms ) interactions ( above the 95% confidence interval ) robustly emerged only after P9 and were prominent in the most mature pups ( Figure 3D , left; n = 38 pups , rank-sum z = \\u22124 . 2 , p=2 . 5\\u00d710\\u22125 ) . All age groups demonstrated significant suppression of spiking activity within the first 500 ms , becoming more marked as development progressed ( Figure 3D , right; n = 38 pups , rank-sum z = 3 . 0 , p=0 . 002 ) . These data implicate that the transient quiescent period demarcates a transition in population spiking that initiates development of a cycle of longer scale network synchronization characteristic of the dynamics observed during mature sleep ( Steriade et al . , 1993 ) . We then sought to understand the functional relevance of this quiescent transition period to network operations . Key LFP properties ( spatial extent , waveform , and power ) can provide an index of the underlying neural population activity and its computational purpose \\u2013 the distance over which neurons can be concurrently recruited , as well as the strength and temporal patterning of this activity ( Lowet et al . , 2015; Str\\u00fcber et al . , 2017; Cole and Voytek , 2017; Stark et al . , 2014 ) . We detected spindle band oscillations , which were present in pups of all ages , to facilitate comparisons . We quantified spatial extent using the two-dimensional organization of the NeuroGrid to determine the proportion of electrodes expressing co-occurring spindle band oscillations with a reference electrode located in primary somatosensory cortex ( Figure 4A;\\u00a0Dahal et al . , 2019 ) . Waveform was characterized using an asymmetry index ( Figure 4B ) and power was extracted from the filtered Hilbert envelope ( Figure 4C ) . Spindle band oscillations in the most immature pups were high power and had a substantially asymmetric waveform , but were expressed over a restricted cortical area ( ~480 \\u00b5m diameter ) . In contrast , spindle band oscillations in the most mature pups were lower power and more symmetric , but could variably be detected over a larger spatial extent ( ~1 . 4 mm diameter ) . Given these observed differences in oscillatory parameters , we asked to what extent they could be used to classify the developmental stage at which the oscillations occurred . A coarse tree model based on spatial extent and waveform asymmetry of manually identified oscillations was effectively trained to classify individual spindle band oscillations as originating from immature ( P5\\u20137 ) or mature ( P10\\u201314 ) pups with 92 . 4% accuracy ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that these parameters capture defining features of the oscillations at the ends of the developmental spectrum . Spindle band oscillations that occurred during the transient quiescent period at the beginning of the second postnatal week were not consistently classified into either group , instead displaying a unique combination of oscillatory parameters: large spatial extent , low power , and intermediate waveform asymmetry ( Figure 4A\\u2013C , yellow bars ) . When examined in a combinatorial fashion , a significant inflection point in oscillation properties emerged between P8\\u00a0and\\u00a09 ( Figure 4E ) . Polynomial regression provided the best fit for these data ( Figure 4\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Bootstrapping data within each developmental day confirmed localization of a nadir at the beginning of the second postnatal week with likelihood far exceeding the distribution obtained by bootstrapping across days ( Figure 4F ) . These data indicate that oscillations are transformed at the beginning of the second postnatal week , potentially reflecting a transition in neural network function from consistently highly localized cortical processing to capacity for broader , tuned recruitment of neural activity . Oscillations in the adult brain precisely organize neural activity across spatial and temporal scales . A key marker for this organization is cross-frequency coupling , which is important for regulating strength of inputs from different afferent pathways ( Schomburg et al . , 2014 ) and directing flow of information processing ( Buschman and Miller , 2007 ) . The marked shift in oscillatory properties that we observed at the beginning of the second postnatal week suggested that this organizational capacity may also be developmentally regulated . We first investigated the relationship of spindle band activity with other frequencies by detecting epochs of sustained increase in spindle band power and calculating measures of amplitude cross-frequency coupling . Spindle band epochs in the most immature animals ( P5\\u20137 ) demonstrated high comodulation across a broad , non-specific range of frequencies , in contrast to frequency-specific comodulation expressed in mature animals ( P13\\u201314; Figure 5A ) . Specific , discrete frequency bands that demonstrated significant temporal coupling with spindle band oscillations emerged only after P8\\u20139 . Discrete coupling with the gamma band ( 45\\u201360 Hz ) first occurred at P10\\u201312 , with an additional high gamma band ( 60\\u201390 Hz ) arising at P13\\u201314 ( Figure 5B; n = 1020 spindle band oscillations from 51 pups; area under the\\u00a0curve [AUC] for 45\\u201360 Hz chi-square = 10 . 13 , p=0 . 02; AUC for 60\\u201390 Hz chi-square = 24 . 29 , p<0 . 001 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that immature networks lack the capacity to couple discrete frequency bands , whereas after the beginning of the second postnatal week such capacity emerges , potentially signaling a developmental shift in the function of oscillations . Furthermore , oscillations facilitate neural communication by biasing spike occurrence to particular phases of the oscillatory waveform . Spindle band oscillations recruited neural spiking above baseline rates to a variable extent across development , with the lowest amount of recruitment occurring at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This trajectory significantly deviated from linearity with a discrete nadir confirmed by bootstrapping during this epoch ( Figure 5\\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . P8 and P9 also exhibited the lowest proportion of recording sessions with significant phase-locking ( kappa > 0 . 1 and alpha < 0 . 05 ) , and consistency of phase-locking abruptly increased at P10 ( Figure 5D , E; n = 38 pups implanted with silicon probes ) . These results reinforce the notion of enhanced information processing capacity in cortical networks after a rapid transitional period at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Thus , multiple LFP and neural spiking measures followed a similar highly nonlinear developmental trajectory marked by a key transition at the beginning of the second postnatal week in mouse pups . We next aimed to investigate whether this pattern of neural maturation was conserved across species . To accomplish this goal , we analyzed clinically acquired continuous EEG data from 54 human subjects ranging from 36 to 69 weeks post-gestation . EEG recordings were included for analysis only if they were reported as normal by the reading epileptologists and the subject had no known underlying neurological or genetic condition . The majority of subjects received a discharge diagnosis of normal movements/behaviors ( e . g . , sleep myoclonus ) or brief resolved unexplained events ( BRUE;\\u00a0Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We analyzed epochs of clinically determined quiet/NREM sleep from each subject using data derived from electrodes overlying human somatosensory cortex ( parietal or central electrodes; no differences were found between these localizations; Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Raw traces and normalized spectral analysis suggested an epoch of transient neural quiescence between 42 and 47 weeks ( Figure 6A , B ) , akin to what we observed at the beginning of the second postnatal week in mice . To quantify these observations , we again used regression fitting to determine whether a nonlinear trajectory was present and bootstrapping of data within and between ages to identify any significant nadirs in neural activity patterns . Wideband power of oscillatory activity followed a highly nonlinear trajectory , with a significant nadir between 42\\u00a0and\\u00a047 weeks ( Figure 6C , Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Power spectra revealed a lack of prominent frequency peaks during this epoch , as well as an overall steeper decay in power with increasing frequency ( corresponding to a larger exponent for the modeled power law; Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 3A\\u2013C ) . Quantification of this aperiodic component of the power spectrum across ages similarly revealed a transient increase around the time of nadir in wideband power ( Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 3D , E ) . As expected from previous work ( Torres and Anderson , 1985 ) , duration of oscillatory epochs generally increased over development , but we did observe a period of relative stationarity coinciding with the decrease in wideband power ( Figure 6D , Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . To assess properties of oscillatory activity in these subjects , we detected spindle band oscillations . Such oscillations were present in all ages , consistent with delta brushes in the youngest subjects and sleep spindles in the older subjects ( Figure 6E ) . We calculated spatial extent of these oscillations as the co-occurrence of spindle band activity across EEG electrodes and found that this activity shifted from highly localized to broader cortical expression around an inflection point between 42\\u00a0and\\u00a047 weeks ( Figure 6F , Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . We also found evidence for significant cross-frequency coupling of higher frequencies with the spindle band emerging after 47 weeks post-gestation ( Figure 6G , H; n = 702 spindle band oscillations from 13 subjects; Kruskal\\u2013Wallis chi-square for AUC = 138 . 4; p<0 . 001 ) . Taken together , these data support the existence of a conserved transient quiescent period in development that bridges a dramatic shift in functional properties of neural networks . \\n We demonstrate that maturation of cortical network dynamics is preceded by a discrete , relatively quiescent , evolutionarily conserved transition period during early postnatal development . During this period , oscillations and neural spiking display a nadir that signals the shift from local , loosely correlated , putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized , spatially distributed , and temporally precise activity . Such a developmental inflection point may reflect a rapid and confluent engagement of mechanisms that enable mature computational processes within cortical networks . Self-organization in complex systems is often mediated by processes that can facilitate sudden transitions in system behavior . Our results provide evidence for such a transition in developing cortex of rodents and humans . Because rodent neurodevelopment is temporally compressed relative to humans , an inflection epoch that lasts 1\\u20132 days in mouse pups could conceivably extend over weeks in humans ( Clancy et al . , 2001 ) . Prior to this inflection point , oscillatory activity was intermittent with non-uniform cycle-to-cycle waveforms and high broadband frequency coherence . Oscillatory activities after the transition became nearly uninterrupted , exhibiting coupling at discrete frequency bands and increased waveform symmetry . Based on these similarities in oscillatory patterns , we infer that the neural spiking features we observe through invasive recordings in mouse pups could also extend to normally developing human infants , where such recordings are not possible . Neural spiking was more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent , strong phase-locking , and higher temporal precision . These features are characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing ( Masquelier et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations . Our results suggest that the cortical network dynamics shift to permit temporally precise neural spiking after the transition period . Significantly synchronized firing within 10\\u201350 ms intervals was absent prior to this period and robustly emerged afterward . This result is consistent with observed increase in pair-wise correlations of spike activity in visual cortex over development ( Colonnese et al . , 2017 ) . Although recruitment of neural spiking during epochs of spindle burst oscillations in immature rodents likely co-activates neurons that share similar afferent inputs ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Colonnese et al . , 2010; Khazipov et al . , 2013; Winnubst et al . , 2015 ) , more precise coordination is required for establishment of flexible , defined neural assemblies ( Dragoi and Buzs\\u00e1ki , 2006 ) , and the capacity of circuits to express sequential activation of these assemblies is developmentally regulated ( Farooq and Dragoi , 2019 ) . We found that the neural population activity demonstrated correlated suppression over a progressively shorter duration ( from approximately 500 to 200 ms ) with maturation . This process is in keeping with the progressively decorrelated activity patterns observed when analysis is performed on the time\\u00a0scale of calcium indicators ( Golshani et al . , 2009; Rochefort et al . , 2009 ) . When oscillations occur in discrete frequency bands , the possibility for complex comodulation arises . This cross-frequency coupling has been linked to information processing in the mature brain , though the precise anatomical substrates and physiological mechanisms that enable its expression are often unknown ( Tort et al . , 2009; Fujisawa and Buzs\\u00e1ki , 2011; Bosman et al . , 2012 ) . We demonstrated that prior to the transient quiescent period the dominant cortical oscillations ( centered on spindle band ) exhibit high comodulation extending from 1 to 100 Hz . During this period , broadband comodulation abruptly decreased and was subsequently replaced by discrete gamma oscillations . Therefore , the oscillatory infrastructure to support cross-frequency coupling arises concomitantly with fine time-scale neural spiking synchronization and robust phase-locking of these spikes to LFP , suggesting an emergence of adult-like information processing capacity at this developmental timepoint . Despite sharing a peak frequency , immature and mature spindle band oscillations are highly differentiable on the joint basis of waveform , power , and spatial extent . Correspondingly , the cellular mechanisms that permit expression of these oscillations , as well as their functional purpose , are different . Comparison of oscillatory features can shed light on the functional capacity of the network . We found that although of high amplitude , spindle band frequency oscillations in the most immature mouse pups were highly and uniformly confined to localized regions of cortex ( 200\\u2013500 \\u00b5m ) roughly corresponding to cortical columns ( Yang et al . , 2013; Feldmeyer et al . , 2013 ) . Similarly , human delta brushes exhibited restricted localization even given the limited spatial resolution of clinical EEG . During the transition period , spindle band oscillations in mouse pups had higher spatial extent , but markedly reduced amplitude , perhaps facilitated by increased intracortical synaptogenesis and maturation of corticothalamic afferents ( Naskar et al . , 2019 ) . The transition period in humans was marked by transiently decreased spatial extent of spindle band oscillations , which we hypothesize is related to attenuation of low-power activity by the intervening tissue between cortical surface and scalp electrode . We observed that mature spindle band activity across species was characterized by increased and customizable spatial extent . Thus , the end of the transient quiescent period marks capacity for oscillatory frequencies that were previously confined to local processing units to extend into broader cortical areas with the potential to establish intercortical communication . Our study was limited to somatosensory cortex , and the existence of a transient quiescent epoch outside of this brain region is unknown . Similar to our results in the spindle band , early gamma oscillations disappear around the beginning to the second postnatal week , to be later replaced with gamma rhythms characteristic of adult animals ( Minlebaev et al . , 2011 ) . In visual cortex , a transient nadir in continuity was not identified , but continuity did rise sharply after P8 with a nonlinear trajectory ( Shen and Colonnese , 2016 ) . Furthermore , the least synchronous neural spiking activity in visual cortex occurred at the beginning of the second postnatal week , potentially in keeping with our decrease in temporal precision of spiking at this time ( Colonnese et al . , 2017 ) . Higher order cortices , which do not directly receive sensory thalamic inputs , may express a different developmental trajectory , in keeping with their distinctive role in information processing , though oscillatory expression during this same epoch has been identified as critical for intact adult function ( Bitzenhofer et al . , 2015; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2021; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , multiple lines of evidence support an abrupt change in cortical network function at the beginning of the second postnatal week . It is possible that our use of surface arrays , which sample summated LFP\\u00a0activity from the undisturbed superficial cortical layers ( I\\u2013III ) , highlights the transient quiescent state compared to penetrating probes that disrupt the cortical surface upon implantation . Furthermore , our conducting polymer-based electrodes have lower impedance than the silicon probes used in most neonatal rodent studies ( Khodagholy et al . , 2015 ) , potentially increasing the sensitivity to changes in oscillatory power and continuity . Given the multitude of anatomic and functional changes that occur during the early postnatal epoch , it is likely that the shift in network operating mode we observe is mechanistically multifactorial . A potential driver for this state is maturation of functional cortical inhibition . Functional inhibitory connections regulate physiological oscillations in mature neural networks enabling submillisecond precision of spike timing and facilitating inter-regional synchronization ( Buzs\\u00e1ki and Chrobak , 1995; Cobb et al . , 1995; Pouille and Scanziani , 2001 ) . In contrast , interneurons do not substantially pace immature oscillations during the first postnatal week , though they can be recruited to and contribute to spatial properties of this activity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Minlebaev et al . , 2011 ) . Functional feedforward inhibition rapidly matures around the beginning of the second postnatal week in mice , resulting in emergence of adult-like hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials and precisely timed action potentials in glutamatergic neurons within the microcircuit ( Daw et al . , 2007 ) . This timepoint , derived from in vitro data , temporally overlaps with the onset of adult-like neural network activity we observe in vivo . In the human brain , when mature functional inhibition arises is not known , but ongoing migration of cells that differentiate into interneurons in the months after birth ( Paredes et al . , 2016 ) suggests the possibility of a postnatal transition to such network activity . The aperiodic component of the power spectrum has been linked to excitatory-inhibitory balance ( Gao et al . , 2017 ) , and our finding that this value transiently increases during the quiescent period could support a temporary increase in inhibition in the human brain . Such a mechanism could underlie the known postnatal disappearance of the EEG bursts characteristics of trace alternant ( Ellingson and Peters , 1980 ) , resulting in the observed low-voltage state with lack of organized oscillatory activity prior to emergence of mature NREM sleep patterns . Whether a period of quiescence is required for physiological transition to mature cortical processing remains unclear . Manipulations that could modulate its expression , such as alteration of the neuromodulatory milieu , activation/suppression of specific cell-type activity , or modulation of the sensory environment ( Smith et al . , 2018 ) , could address this question . Forging linkages to activity patterns observed using calcium imaging ( Wilson et al . , 2018 ) and enabling high spatiotemporal resolution chronic in vivo electrophysiology will also be critical . In humans , neuronal dynamics suggestive of mature information processing mechanisms are established by 6 months of age ( Jannesari et al . , 2020 ) , and changes in sleep patterns have been identified as markers for brain connectivity from toddlers to adolescents ( Kurth et al . , 2017 ) . Extending such measures to earlier timepoints could help to clarify functional ramifications of the quiescent period in humans . Furthermore , the manifestation of a developmental epoch of relative quiescence in electrophysiological activity suggests the possibility for use as a network-level biomarker that could be altered in disorders of neurodevelopment , from mouse models to human subjects . Neural processes in the adult brain are characterized by a specific constellation of network dynamics that are necessary for execution of complex behaviors and cognition ( Tolner et al . , 2012 ) . Our results suggest that the capacity for these processes simultaneously emerges abruptly after a distinct transition period characterized by relative neural quiescence . This transient quiescent period may be a critical stage that indicates a shift in the neural network operating mode from a predominantly external stimulus-driven state to one that facilitates the internal representations associated with planning and executive function . \\n PEDOT:PSS ( Clevios PH1000 ) was purchased from Heraeus . Ethylene glycol , ( 3-glycidyloxypropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( GOPS ) , 4-dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid ( DBSA ) , and\\u00a03- ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( A-174 silane ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich . Micro-90 concentrated cleaning solution was purchased from Special Coating Services . AZnLOF2020 ( negative photoresist ) , AZ9260 ( positive photoresist ) , and\\u00a0AZ 400K and AZ 300MIF ( metal ion free ) developers were acquired from MicroChemicals , Merck . To create the PEDOT:PSS films , a mixture of aqueous dispersion ( Clevios PH1000 ) and ethylene glycol was prepared and mixed with GOPS ( 1\\u00a0wt% ) and DBSA ( 0 . 1 wt% ) . The fabrication process involved deposition and patterning of parylene C , evaporation of Au for electrodes and interconnects , and PEDOT:PSS films coating . Parylene C ( 1 . 2-\\u03bcm-thick ) was deposited on quartz wafers ( 100 mm outer diameter [O . D . ] , thickness of 1 mm ) using an SCS Labcoater 2 . For the metal lift-off , AZnLOF2020-negative photoresist was spin-coated at 3000 r . p . m . on the substrate , baked at 105\\u00b0C for 90 s , exposed to ultraviolet light using a Suss MA6 Mask Aligner , and developed with AZ 300MIF developer . Metallic layers ( 10 nm Ti , 150 nm Au ) were deposited using an e-beam metal evaporator ( Angstrom EvoVac Multi-Process ) and patterned by soaking the substrate in a bath of resist remover . A second layer of parylene C ( insulation layer ) was deposited to a thickness of 1 . 2 \\u03bcm and its adhesion to the bottom layer was enhanced by the addition of 3- ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( A-174 silane ) during chemical vapor deposition . An anti-adhesion agent ( 5 wt% Micro-90 diluted in deionized water ) was deposited on the substrate followed by an additional sacrificial layer of parylene C that was subsequently used for the peel-off process . The stacked layers were patterned with a layer of AZ9260-positive photoresist and dry etched with a plasma-reactive ion-etching process ( Oxford Plasmalab 80; 180 W , 50 sccm O2 , and 2 sccm SF6 ) to shape electrode area and electrical contact pads . Specifically , AZ9260 was spin-coated at 5000 r . p . m . , baked at 115\\u00b0C for 90 s , exposed using a Suss MA6 Mask Aligner , and developed with AZ400K developer ( 1:4 with deionized water ) . To obtain clean etching of large areas , the electrical contact pads were guarded by an extra layer of AZnLOF2020 ( 3000 r . p . m . ) between the metal layer and the silane-treated parylene . Each pad was etched along its perimeter , and the parylene deposited on top of the photoresist was removed once immersed in acetone bath . Finally , PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of the electrodes and patterned by peeling off the last parylene layer . The probes had 119 electrodes regularly spaced on a diagonal square centered lattice with pitch of 77\\u2013177 \\u00b5m and regularly interspersed perforations were created . Total device thickness was 4 \\u00b5m . All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University Irving Medical Center . Data from 108 Swiss-Webster mouse pups ( 3\\u20139 g , 5\\u201314 days of age ) that underwent intracranial implantation was used for neurophysiological analysis . Pups were kept on a regular 12 hr\\u201312 hr light-dark cycle and housed with the mother before surgery . No prior experimentation had been performed on these mice . Anesthesia was induced by hypothermia in ice for P5\\u20136 pups and with 3% isoflurane for pups aged P7\\u201314 . Pups were then comfortably placed on a customized platform for head fixation , surgery , and recording . Acclimatization to head fixation was not performed as it has been found to be unnecessary for neonatal rodents; careful positioning and \\u2018swaddling\\u2019 was performed to maximize pup comfort ( Blumberg et al . , 2015; Corner and Kwee , 1976 ) . All animals were maintained under anesthesia with 0 . 75\\u20131 . 5% isoflurane during surgery . Time under anesthesia was minimized to facilitate postoperative recovery . Pre- and postoperative systemic and local analgesics were employed , including subcutaneous bupivacaine , systemic ketoprofen , and topical lidocaine . These analgesics were selected to attain appropriate pain control while minimizing effects on neurophysiological activity in the postoperative period ( Blumberg et al . , 2015; Foley et al . , 2019 ) . Electrodes fabricated from fine gauge wire were inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of the neck and abdomen . These electrodes continuously registered electrocardiography ( ECG ) and electromyography ( EMG ) signals throughout the surgical and recording period , and were used to monitor recovery from anesthesia . A custom metal plate was attached to the skull to provide head fixation . For NeuroGrid implantations , a craniotomy was centered over primary somatosensory cortex and the array was placed over the dura . For silicon probe implantations , H32 NeuroNexus 32-site single-shank probes were used . A small cranial window over primary somatosensory cortex ( approximately AP \\u22121 . 5 mm , ML 2 mm; adjusted proportionally based on pup age ) was opened , and the probe was stereotactically advanced until all electrodes were inserted below the pial surface ( 900 \\u00b5m ) . Postoperatively , the pup was comfortably positioned , provided with familiar olfactory cues , and placed in a custom recording box with temperature and humidity control . Temperature was regulated by a heater equipped with feedback control to ensure stable , physiological body temperature of the pups throughout the recording period . Neurophysiological signal acquisition was performed in the custom recording box , which was grounded to shield ambient electrical noise . Concurrent video monitoring was performed using a camera mounted inside the box . Pups recovered from anesthesia , as determined by recovery criteria including increase of heart rate to plateau and onset of sleep-wake cycling , for a minimum of 30 min before neurophysiological recordings were used for analysis . The recovery period was prolonged until recovery criteria were met , and all pups used for experimentation recovered within 60 min postoperatively . Neurophysiological signals were amplified , digitized continuously at 20 kHz using a local preamplifier ( RHD2000 Intan Technology ) , and stored for offline analysis with 16-bit format . Spontaneous activity was acquired for 1\\u20132 hr prior to euthanasia and perfusion . At the end of experimentation , pups were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital ( 100 mg/kg ) . For the NeuroGrid experiments , the position of the array was visualized using light microscopy and the brain tissue underlying the corners of the array was stereotactically marked using a 30 gauge needle coated with chitosan compound ( Rauhala et al . , 2020 ) . Pups were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , followed by 4% paraformaldehyde . Brains were stored for 24\\u201348 hr in 4% PFA at 4\\u00b0C prior to transfer to PBS solution . Cortices were \\ufb02attened at room temperature ( RT ) after removal of the underlying midline structures and kept in 4% PFA for 24 hr ( 4\\u00b0C ) . Flattened cortices were sliced using a Leica vibratome vt1000S at 50 \\u00b5m . The slices were then incubated for 1 hr at RT in a blocking solution composed of PBS ( 0 . 01 M ) , 3% Normal Donkey Serum , and 0 . 3% Triton X-100 . Slices were transferred to a solution containing anti-Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 ( VGlut2 ) polyclonal guinea-pig antibody ( AB2251-I Sigma Millipore ) in a 1:2000 dilution and kept overnight at 4\\u00b0C . Subsequently , the tissue was washed and incubated with secondary antibody , Alexa Fluor 594 Af\\ufb01niPure Donkey Anti-guinea pig IgG ( H+L ) ( 706-585-148 ) from Jackson Immunoresearch at 1:1000 dilution . Lastly , the tissue was incubated with DAPI ( D9542-5MG; Sigma-Aldrich ) at 0 . 2 \\u00b5g/mL and after washing , the brain slices were mounted with Fluoromount-G ( 00-4958-02 , ThermoFisher ) . Fluorescent images were captured and tiled using a computer-assisted camera connected to an ECHO Revolve microscope . The images were adjusted for brightness and contrast and assembled into panels using ImageJ and Adobe Illustrator . The regularly spaced , hexagonal lattice of electrode spacing across the NeuroGrid enabled localization of each electrode relative to the marked corners of the array and primary sensory cortices . The spatially extensive nature of the NeuroGrid relative to pup brain size facilitated consistent anatomical targeting . Localization of silicon probe electrodes to cortical region and layers was performed using a combination of intraoperative visualization and histological reconstruction . Probes were inserted under visual guidance , with the most superficial electrode placed just below the pia . Regular , precise spacing of electrodes along the shank enabled determination of each electrode\\u2019s depth from the cortical surface . Coronal brain slices stained with DAPI and vGlut2 permitted localization of probe implantation site relative to barrel cortex . All recordings were visually inspected for quality , and channels that exhibited ongoing electrical or mechanical artifact were removed from analysis . Data was analyzed using MATLAB ( MathWorks ) and visualized using Neuroscope . Raw recordings were downsampled to 1250 Hz to obtain LFPs , and band-pass filtered between 250 Hz and 2500 Hz for analysis of neural spiking . Signals from EMG wires inserted into nuchal and ventral subcutaneous tissue were high-pass filtered at 300 Hz , rectified , and smoothed to obtain a power envelope . The mean of this high-pass filtered power was determined . Epochs consistent with high tone were identified when the signal surpassed a threshold defined by 1 . 5\\u20133 . 5 standard deviations above this mean . Wakefulness was defined as a period of sustained high tone for at least 1 . 5 s . Myoclonic twitches involving contractions of the muscles of the head , forelimbs , hindlimbs , or trunk as observed on video recording were correlated with an increase in EMG signal that surpassed the threshold for < 1 . 5 s . Muscle atonia ( consistent with sleep ) was identified when the EMG signal remained below the threshold for at least 2 s . Sleep epochs were further classified as putative active or quiet sleep . Quiet sleep was identified when muscle atonia was paired with quiescence of behavior for at least 10 consecutive seconds . Active sleep was identified by myoclonic twitches that occurred on a background of muscle atonia . Similar approaches have been shown to correlate with electrophysiological markers of active and quiet sleep , and have been used for state-dependent developmental analyses ( Seelke and Blumberg , 2008; Turek , 1999 ) . We retrospectively analyzed EEG recordings from 54 patients who underwent continuous monitoring with surface EEG as part of clinical diagnostic assessment . Analysis of these data was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Irving Medical Center , and all data collection occurred at this institution . All data reviewed was initially obtained for clinical management purposes and informed consent was waived as per 45 CFR 46 . 116 . Each patient had EEG electrodes placed based on the internationally recognized 10\\u201320 configuration . Electrode impedance was monitored and maintained within appropriate ranges as per American Clinical Neurophysiology Society Guidelines by certified clinical EEG technologists . Patients ranging in age from birth to 8 months who had at least 4 hr of high-quality continuous EEG monitoring were identified through the clinical electrophysiology database ( Natus ) . Using the hospital admission record , patients were excluded if ( 1 ) the EEG was reported as abnormal by the reading electrophysiologist; ( 2 ) the patient had a known underlying neurological or genetic condition; ( 3 ) the patient was diagnosed with a new neurological condition during the course of the hospital admission; and ( 4 ) corrected gestational age could not be determined from information contained in the medical record . Indication for EEG in eligible patients was most commonly paroxysmal movements concerning to parents for abnormal activity , with discharge diagnosis identifying normal movements/behaviors ( e . g . , sleep myoclonus , roving eye movements during REM sleep ) or BRUE ( Figure 6\\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Corrected gestational age , rounded to the nearest week , was used to classify patient age . If the phrase \\u2018full term\\u2019 was employed in the medical record , corrected gestational age was calculated based on birth at 40 weeks . This approach allowed a precision of 2 weeks in corrected gestational age . Recordings always included both waking and sleep epochs . Three to five representative epochs of artifact-free quiet/NREM sleep were identified for subsequent analysis by a certified clinical electrophysiologist . Data was sampled at 256\\u2013512 Hz by clinical amplifiers . Raw data ( referential ) exported from Natus was used for all analyses . If electrical noise contaminated the recording , a 60 Hz notch filter was used . P3 or P4 electrodes , overlying the parietal lobe , were selected for spectral analysis . If these electrodes were non-functional , C3 or C4 electrodes , overlying the central sulcus , were used . No differences were found when using data derived from parietal and central electrodes in subjects where all channels were functional . To visualize spectrograms , a parametric autoregressive ( order of 1 ) whitening method was first applied to the data . For rodent data ( sampled at 1250 Hz ) and human data ( sampled at 256\\u2013512 Hz ) , time-frequency decomposition was performed using analytic Gabor wavelet transform to enhance temporal resolution . Wavelet spectrograms centered at twitch times were normalized by z-scoring and averaged to obtain trigger-averaged spectrograms . Power was extracted for quantification from the magnitude of the analytic Gabor wavelet transform . Epochs of oscillatory activity were defined by presence of rectified signal amplitude above the 99th percentile of the wideband noise floor . To measure periodic and aperiodic properties of human neural data , power spectra were extracted using multi-taper method ( http:/chronux . org ) and modeled using \\u2018fitting oscillations and one over f\\u2019 ( Corner and Kwee , 1976 ) . In order to quantify the changing tendency of each feature over time , we modeled the trends with linear and polynomial regression models . To find the optimal fit that most accurately represented the overall trend without overfitting , we used LOOCV to evaluate the models . The model with the minimum MSE was considered to have the best fit . When model fit predicted existence of local extrema , we used bootstrapping to estimate the location of these extrema for the trajectory of each property we investigated . For animal data , we resampled with replacement within each day from P5 to P14 . For human data , we resampled within each 1\\u20132 weeks . Age was jittered with a window of 0 . 5 days and 0 . 5 weeks for animal and human data , respectively , to aid with fitting . We found the age corresponding to the first peak or trough of the regression line across development . This process was repeated 10 , 000 times to generate a probability distribution of location of local extrema across the developmental trajectory . The same process was repeated using resampling with replacement across all timepoints of the trajectory ( 10 , 000 iterations ) to generate a null distribution for comparison . Spindle band oscillations were detected based on wavelet-derived power and duration parameters . Intervals of oscillatory activity containing spindle band power were first detected and a ratio of normalized autoregressive wavelet ( Gabor ) -based\\u00a0PAR was then calculated to identify discrete spindle band oscillations . Oscillatory intervals were detected by comparing the spindle band power ( Pspi ) of 8\\u201325 Hz with threshold . Thresholds were determined relative to median absolute deviation ( median ( |Pspi| ) 0 . 6745 ) in the sleep intervals . Because this value varied markedly across development , thresholds were derived empirically but kept consistent across each age group . The value was decreased for silicon probe recordings in P5\\u20137 pups compared to NeuroGrid recordings to maintain consistent detection despite quantifiably different signal to noise ratio . PAR\\u00a0was then calculated based on the following equation:PAR=Pspi- ( Plow+Phigh ) Pspi+Plow+Phighwhere spindle band power ( Pspi ) was based on 8\\u201325 Hz , low band power was based on 1\\u20135 Hz ( Plow ) , and high band power was based on 30\\u201380 Hz ( Phigh ) . Spindle band events were identified when the ratio crossed \\u20130 . 1 for a minimum of 300 ms and a maximum of 5 s and had a peak greater than 0 . All detections were visually inspected for accuracy for each recording session and independently verified by an analyst blinded to detection parameters . In human EEG data , spindle band oscillations were detected across all channels as in mice , using a constant threshold relative to median absolute deviation ( median ( |Pspi| ) 0 . 6745 ) in the intervals of quiet/NREM sleep and PAR was calculated as above . For subjects aged less than 40 weeks , the low band power was based on 2\\u20136 Hz to aid with accurate detection of delta brushes . The channel with maximal oscillation power in the spindle band was selected for further analysis . Spindle band oscillations were characterized by their power , spatial extent , and spindle asymmetry ( Cole and Voytek , 2017 ) . Power was calculated by bandpass filtering each spindle band oscillation between 8\\u00a0and\\u00a025 Hz . We then calculated the rectified value of Hilbert transformed filtered signals to derive the power envelopes . The median value of each spindle band oscillation was defined as its power . Spatial extent was calculated by determining the number of channels simultaneous expressing spindle band oscillations with a manually selected channel located in primary somatosensory cortex for mice and the channel with the highest spindle band power for humans ( intersection of spindle start and end points > 300 ms and separation of spindle midpoints \\u2264 50 ms on channels being compared ) . The spatial extent was expressed as a ratio of the number of channels with simultaneous occurrence and the total number of functional channels on the NeuroGrid . Data used for these calculations had a similar proportion and placement of channels located within primary somatosensory cortex . To quantify the sharpness of each spindle band oscillation\\u2019s peak and trough , they were first broadly bandpass filtered at 5\\u201330 Hz . Rising and falling zero-crossing points were identified . Peaks were recognized as the maximum timepoint in raw data between a rising zero-crossing point and a falling zero-crossing point; troughs were recognized as the minimum timepoint in raw data between a rising zero-crossing point and a falling zero-crossing point . Sharpness of a peak was defined as the mean difference between the voltage at the oscillatory peak Vpeak and the voltage at timepoints before ( Vbefore ) and after the peak ( Vafter ) , where the timepoint corresponded to a phase shift of approximately \\u03c0 ( 8 ms ) . Trough sharpness was defined similarly:Sharppeak=Vpeak-Vbefore+ ( Vpeak-Vafter ) 2Sharptrough=Vbefore-Vtrough+ ( Vafter-Vtrough ) 2 As the absolute difference between the extrema and the surrounding timepoints increases , the extrema sharpness increases . Extrema mean sharpness ratios ( ESR ) were calculated as a metric to quantify the sharpness asymmetry of each spindle . The ESR was defined in the following manner:ESR=1Npeaks\\u2211peakssharppeak1Ntroughs\\u2211troughssharptrough Larger deviation from 1 indicated greater sharpness asymmetry of the spindle . Spectral analysis of the data was performed , and any data contaminated with electrical noise ( 60 Hz ) was eliminated from analysis to prevent spurious correlations . Comodulograms of cross-frequency coupling were computed based on a Gabor wavelet of raw data around the time of spindle band oscillation ( 4 s ) , followed by a Gaussian window convolution with duration matched to the frequency . The correlation matrix was calculated based on the magnitude of the wavelet components . Comparisons with p<0 . 05 after Bonferroni\\u2013Holm correction for multiple comparisons were considered statistically significant . Columns of the correlation matrix corresponding to spindle band ( 10\\u201320 Hz ) were extracted and summated to obtain a curve representing the magnitude of frequency coupling to this band . Each local maximum coupling value was detected along with its peak prominence ( how significant a peak is on account of its intrinsic value and location relative to other peaks ) and peak width ( frequency range with between half-prominence points ) . Peaks were thresholded based on prominence and width ( \\u0394f < 1/fc , peak prominence > 0 . 75 ) . Wide-band coupling index was calculated by ( peak value \\u00d7 peak prominence ) /peak width . AUC was calculated by integrated the summated coupling curves . Neural spiking was detected on each channel by thresholding negative peaks greater than four times the high-pass filtered noise floor during epochs of sleep . Coincident spike times across a greater distance than expected for physiological spike waveforms ( ~300 \\u00b5m ) were presumed to be non-physiological and eliminated from all channels . Electrodes were allocated based on histology and electrophysiological characteristics into zones roughly corresponding to superficial ( I\\u2013III ) and deep ( IV\\u2013VI ) cortical layers . Electrodes from two non-contiguous sites ( >200 \\u00b5m vertical separation ) within the deep cortical layers and one site from superficial cortical layers were used for subsequent analysis . Because individual neuron action potentials could potentially be detected on more than one channel , spikes occurring on different channels within the same histological zone < 2 ms apart were presumed to be duplicate detections and only the first spike was used for analysis . ISIs for the neural population were calculated as the absolute time between sorted spike times within the zone . A modified convolution method was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for population spike time autocorrelograms with a bin size of 10 ms . Peristimulus time histograms were calculated using a bin size of 50 ms with 95% confidence intervals determined from a shuffled distribution of spike times . To derive spike phase-locking to spindle band oscillations , the oscillatory epochs were first downsampled to 125 Hz and narrowly bandpass filtered at 9\\u201316 Hz . Phase was extracted using Hilbert transform . Phase bins \\u03c0/24 were used for quantification of spike phase preference . Statistical analysis was performed using a combination of open-source MATLAB toolboxes and custom MATLAB code . A modified convolution method was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for correlograms . Significance of phase-locking to spindle band oscillations was determined using alpha < 0 . 05 with a corresponding kappa value of > 0 . 1 Kuiper test ( Circular Statistics Toolbox for MATLAB ) . Null distributions were generated based on 500 instances of data shuffling and used to calculate 95% confidence intervals . Probability distributions were compared using two-sample Kolmogorov\\u2013Smirnov tests with correction for multiple comparisons . Differences between groups were calculated using non-parametric rank-sum ( Wilcoxon ) or ANOVA ( Kruskal\\u2013Wallis with Bonferroni correction ) depending on the nature of the data analyzed . When event size varied between groups , a random sample of events was selected from groups with larger event sizes to ensure group differences were not driven by degrees of freedom . Error bars represent standard error of mean . Testing was two-tailed and significance level was p<0 . 05 .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"headings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"elife-01133-v1\",\n          \"elife-27744-v3\",\n          \"elife-69011-v2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Lay summary =  Over 90% of adults around the world are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus . Like other closely related viruses , such as those that cause chicken pox and cold sores , an infection lasts for the rest of the person’s life , although the virus generally remains in a latent or dormant state . However , under certain conditions the latent viruses can cause cancers to develop; in fact , it is estimated that such infections are responsible for nearly 2% of all cancer deaths worldwide . One way that healthy human cells prevent cancer is by triggering their own death in a process called apoptosis . The Epstein-Barr virus can block apoptosis , therefore making the cells more likely to become cancerous . Previous research identified one protein in the Epstein-Barr virus that promotes cancer by preventing infected cells from dying as normal . However , even in the absence of this protein , Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells remain resistant to apoptosis . This suggests that the virus has another way of blocking cell death . Price et al . have now used a technique that stresses living cells in a way that reveals which proteins prevent apoptosis to study human cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus . This revealed that soon after infection , the virus could force the human cell to produce MCL-1 , a protein that prevents cell death . Later , the Epstein-Barr virus enlisted a second human protein called BFL-1 , which makes the infected cell further resistant to apoptosis . Price et al . discovered that a protein in the Epstein-Barr virus called EBNA3A controls the production of the MCL-1 and BFL-1 proteins . In the future , developing therapies that target these proteins may lead to new treatments for cancers caused by the Epstein-Barr virus . Such treatments would be likely to have fewer side effects for patients than traditional chemotherapies .\n",
            "Full text article = Latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is causally linked to several human cancers . EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation . The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells . However , during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis . Therefore , we sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection . We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells ( BCL-2 ) to early-infected ( MCL-1/BCL-2 ) and immortalized cells ( BFL-1 ) . This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein . This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis . \n",
            " An estimated 15% of cancers worldwide are caused by infectious agents like viruses . Of these , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) was the first human tumor virus discovered and is associated with malignancies of both B lymphocyte and epithelial cell origin . Normally , T cells prevent the development of EBV-associated malignancies and the virus persists quiescently in latently-infected memory B cells . As a result , nearly all adults in the world are latently infected ( Longnecker et al . , 2013 ) , making EBV a particularly widespread and successful pathogen . However , in the absence of a healthy immune system , such as following organ transplant or HIV infection , EBV can transform B cells leading to markedly increased rates of lymphoma in these populations . Primary human B cell infection in vitro by EBV leads to their growth transformation and serves as a model for oncogenesis in EBV-associated lymphomas . This process requires the expression of six viral latent genes: Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 ( EBNA1 ) , EBNA2 , EBNA-LP , EBNA3A , EBNA3C and Latent Membrane Protein 1 ( LMP1 ) ( Longnecker et al . , 2013 ) . EBNA2 , the major viral transcriptional activator and the first to be expressed upon infection , upregulates expression of the other viral EBNA genes as well as host genes ( Wang et al . , 2000; Zimber-Strobl and Strobl , 2001 ) . EBNA2 also activates the expression of the viral oncoprotein LMP1 , which drives the immortalization of the infected B cell into a lymphoblastoid cell line , or LCL , that proliferates indefinitely in culture . Together , the EBV latent oncoproteins mimic key aspects of normal B cell biology , promote proliferation , and inhibit the host innate tumor suppressor response to uncontrolled proliferation ( Allday , 2013; Price and Luftig , 2014 ) . It is well-established that the LMP1 oncoprotein is necessary for continued LCL growth and survival ( Kaye et al . , 1993; Zimber-Strobl et al . , 1996 ) . LMP1 mimics a pro-survival TNF receptor that signals constitutively through the NFκB pathway to promote proliferation and suppress apoptosis in transformed cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al . , 2000; Okan et al . , 1995; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . In fact , inhibition of the NFκB pathway activated downstream of LMP1 leads to apoptosis in LCLs . However , recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that , early after infection , B cells rapidly proliferate despite low levels of LMP1 expression and NFκB activation ( Nikitin et al . , 2010; Price et al . , 2012 ) . Surprisingly , these early-infected cells also show no overt signs of apoptosis despite strong activation of the cellular DNA damage response ( Nikitin et al . , 2014 ) . This suggests that in early-infected cells , there is a viral-mediated mechanism independent of LMP1 signaling that promotes survival . Several LMP1-independent mechanisms to subvert apoptosis have been described . For example , the viral BCL-2 homologue BHRF1 confers chemoresistance in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) ( Kvansakul et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , the viral BHRF1 and BALF1 proteins exert non-redundant roles in protecting initially infected cells from apoptosis ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt , 2005 ) . In addition , expression of the EBNA3 proteins induces resistance to apoptosis in BL cells and primary B cells by downregulating Bim expression ( Paschos et al . , 2009; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) , thereby making infected cells less ‘primed’ for apoptosis . The EBNA3 family is also known to epigenetically downregulate additional human genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis ( Allday , 2013; Harth-Hertle et al . , 2013; Hertle et al . , 2009; Paschos et al . , 2012; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . It has been shown that the EBNA3 proteins mediate these epigenetic effects , in part , via interacting with additional proteins in such a way that chromatin architecture can be dramatically altered ( Bazot et al . , 2015; McClellan et al . , 2013 ) . While thought to be generally repressive in nature , recent work has shown that in some instances EBNA3 proteins can activate gene transcription ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . In sum , viral proteins confer several survival advantages to infected cells , which often results in EBV-positive lymphomas that are more difficult to treat than their EBV-negative counterparts ( Kelly et al . , 2006 ) . The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is controlled by complex protein—protein interactions at the surface of mitochondria that regulate the release of cytochrome c ( Youle and Strasser , 2008 ) . These functional interactions can be interrogated with an established approach called ‘BH3 profiling’ , which uses peptides derived from BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins to identify the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members important for preventing apoptosis in a particular cell ( Del Gaizo Moore and Letai , 2013; Deng et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , molecular characterization of the interface between BH3 domains of these proteins has allowed for the creation of a new class of small molecule inhibitors that promote apoptosis directly in sensitive cell types ( Billard , 2013; Oltersdorf et al . , 2005 ) . These so-called ‘BH3 mimetics’ are highly specific and show great promise in clinical trials ( Letai , 2008 ) . In this study , we characterized the BH3 profile of uninfected and EBV-infected primary human B cells from early proliferation through long-term outgrowth . We validated these profiles using BH3 mimetics and , importantly , identified a novel virus-specific transition in survival mechanisms between early and late stages of latent infection with implications for therapy of EBV-associated malignancies . \n",
            " Previously , our laboratory has identified an early period after EBV infection of primary human B cells where , despite robust virus-mediated proliferation and activation of the pro-apoptotic DNA damage response , there is little expression of the key viral survival factor LMP1 ( Price et al . , 2012 ) . In order to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1 and NFκB activity early after infection , as well as through long-term outgrowth , we performed BH3 profiling to query apoptotic priming at the mitochondria of infected cells . Briefly , this technique works by permeabilizing cells , staining with a mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye , and then treating cells with peptides derived from the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins , including the activator BH3-only protein BIM and the sensitizer BH3-only proteins BAD , PUMA , NOXA , BMF , and HRK ( Figure 1A ) . By measuring mitochondrial depolarization induced by the activator BH3 peptide , BIM , and the pan-apoptotic sensitizer , PUMA , BH3 profiling can measure the overall ‘priming’ of the cells for apoptosis ( that is , the cell's distance from the apoptotic threshold ) . Further , by measuring depolarization induced by the sensitizer BH3 peptides BAD , NOXA , BMF , and HRK , BH3 profiling can also determine the cell’s specific dependence on particular anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins , including BCL-2 , BCL-XL , MCL-1 , and BFL-1 ( Del Gaizo Moore and Letai , 2013 ) . We BH3 profiled three cell states: ( i ) uninfected B cells purified from the peripheral blood of normal human donors ( B Cell ) , ( ii ) FACS-purified proliferating EBV-infected B cells seven days post-infection ( Prolif ) , and ( iii ) the resulting EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) derived five weeks post-infection from the same donors ( Figure 1B , C ) . Both latently infected cell populations are 100% EBV-positive as shown previously by immuno-fluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 006 BH3 profiling revealed that EBV infection of primary B cells only modestly reduces overall mitochondrial priming ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 compare 10 µM Puma from B to Prolif and 1 µM Bim from B/Prolif to LCL ) . However , the BH3 profiles revealed marked changes in the BCL-2 family dependencies between the groups suggesting specific , testable hypotheses ( Figure 1D ) . For instance , a cell dependent on BCL-2 or BCL-w for survival would exhibit mitochondrial depolarization upon exposure to Bad , Puma , or Bmf peptides , while a cell dependent upon MCL-1 would depolarize upon exposure to Noxa , Puma , or Bmf peptides . Uninfected B cells depolarized their mitochondria upon treatment with Bad , Puma , or Bmf peptides , but not Noxa or Hrk peptides , indicating reliance on BCL-2 or BCL-w as a pro-survival BCL2 family member ( Figure 1E ) . EBV-infected proliferating B cells ( Prolif ) lost sensitivity to the Bad peptide but remained sensitive to Puma and Bmf , supporting a survival mechanism reliant on both MCL-1 , to block Bad-induced depolarization , and BCL-2/BCL-w , to block Noxa-induced depolarization ( Figure 1E ) . Finally , LCLs lost sensitivity to Bmf , but sensitivity to Puma did not change between Prolif and LCLs , suggesting additional BFL-1 mediated pro-survival effects in LCLs ( Figure 1E ) . We hypothesized that EBV infection reduces the dependence of B cells on BCL-2 , BCL-xL , or BCL-w for survival given the loss of Bad sensitivity between uninfected and early-infected B cells ( Figure 1E ) . To test this , we treated PBMCs with small molecule BH3 mimetics either concurrent with EBV infection or at the onset of proliferation ( 3 . 5 days post-infection ( dpi ) ) and measured the number of proliferating EBV-infected B cells at 7 dpi using flow cytometry and the proliferation tracking dye CellTrace Violet ( Figure 2A ) . We also assayed the sensitivity of monoclonal LCLs to BH3 mimetic treatment for an equivalent period of time ( Figure 2A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 007Figure 2 .

Source data for cell counts and apoptosis assays performed with BH3 mimetics targeting BCL-2 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 008 We first tested the sensitivity of EBV-infected cells to ABT-737 , a potent small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2 , BCL-xL , and BCL-w ( Oltersdorf et al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with dependence of uninfected B cells on these BCL-2 family members predicted by BH3 profiling , treatment with ABT-737 concurrent with EBV infection resulted in an IC50 in proliferating B cells of ~10 nM ( Figure 2B–C ) . However , when ABT-737 was added to EBV-infected cells after the onset of virus-induced proliferation or to immortalized LCLs we observed high-level ABT-737 resistance with an IC50of ~2–4 µM ( Figure 2B–C ) . ABT-737 promoted apoptosis as measured by caspase 3/7 activity and Annexin V positivity in uninfected B cells , while proliferating cells at 7 dpi and EBV transformed LCLs were resistant to apoptosis induction ( Figure 2D–E ) . We next sought to confirm BCL-2 as the specific anti-apoptotic protein important for uninfected B cell survival and to further validate our BH3 profiling results . To do this , we used ABT-199 , a specific inhibitor of BCL-2 with minimal off-target effects on BCL-xL or BCL-w ( Souers et al . , 2013 ) . Similar to ABT-737 , EBV induced potent resistance to ABT-199 ( Figure 2F–G ) . Therefore , uninfected human peripheral blood CD19+ B cells depend on BCL-2 for survival and EBV upregulates additional survival proteins to potently suppress apoptosis induced by BCL-2 antagonism . Our BH3 profiling experiments predicted that EBV-infected B cells are less primed for apoptosis due to the combined protective effects of MCL-1 and BCL-2 during early proliferation with additional protection afforded by BFL-1 in immortalized B cells ( Figure 1E ) . To functionally characterize EBV-regulated survival , we first analyzed BCL-2 family member mRNA expression through B cell outgrowth . We observed that MCL-1 mRNA increased from uninfected B to EBV-infected and proliferating B cells and was further increased in LCLs ( Figure 3A ) . Over the same infection time course , both BCL-2 and BFL-1 were initially downregulated in early proliferating B cells relative to uninfected B cells , then upregulated during LCL outgrowth . These data are consistent with prior transcriptomic analyses from our group ( Price et al . , 2012 ) and others indicating that BCL-2 and BFL-1 are both ultimately upregulated by EBV ( D'Souza et al . , 2004; Henderson et al . , 1991 ) . BCL-2 and MCL-1 protein levels mirror their respective mRNA expression levels during B cell outgrowth ( Figure 3B , quantified in Figure 3C; note there is no viable BFL-1 antibody ) . MCL-1 has been known to be expressed as different isoforms , a long ( MCL-1 ( L ) ) and a short ( MCL-1 ( S ) ) ( Perciavalle et al . , 2012 ) . While the MCL-1 ( L ) isoform is associated with anti-apoptotic activity , MCL1 ( S ) appears to be more important for mitochondrial maintenance; thus , for the scope of this study , we focused primarily on MCL-1 ( L ) , referred to as MCL-1 . The aforementioned data indicate that ABT-737 resistance coincides with MCL-1 induction . We therefore sought to test the importance of MCL-1 in promoting EBV-induced ABT-737 resistance . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 009Figure 3 . MCL-1 collaborates with BCL-2 to protect EBV-infected proliferating B cells early after infection while BFL-1 additionally protects LCLs late after infection .

Data shown is the average and SEM from four human donors . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 012 We hypothesized that selective inhibition of MCL-1 should render early proliferating cells , but not LCLs , sensitive to drugs that target BCL-2 , namely ABT-737 and the BCL-2 specific inhibitor ABT-199 . Treatment of EBV-infected proliferating B cells at 7dpi or LCLs with either ABT-737 , ABT-199 , or a specific MCL-1 inhibitor A1210477 ( A-1210 ) induced minimal apoptosis ( Figure 3D–E ) . However , when cells were treated with both A-1210 and either ABT-737 or ABT-199 , early proliferating cells , but not LCLs , displayed elevated markers of apoptosis ( Figure 3D–E ) . The combined action of ABT-199 and A-1210 supports the hypothesis generated by BH3 profiling that early-infected cells are more dependent upon MCL-1 and BCL-2 for survival than are LCLs . Further corroborating these findings , we found that indirect inhibition of MCL-1 with flavopiridol led to sensitivity of early-infected cells to BCL-2 antagonists . MCL-1 is a highly labile transcript and protein , and its expression is known to be sensitive to RNA polymerase II stalling induced by CDK9 inhibition ( Gojo et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , the CDK9 inhibitor , flavopiridol , induced rapid decreases in MCL-1 mRNA and protein , while leaving BCL-2 and BFL-1 levels largely unaffected ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B ) . Supporting our A-1210 data , we found that early proliferating cells were more sensitive to apoptosis induced by a combination of flavopirodol and ABT-737 than LCLs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ) ( Leverson et al . , 2015 ) . To determine if BFL-1 was important for survival in LCLs , we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the BFL1 ( Bcl2a1 ) coding sequence . We successfully generated a clonal LCL with deletions in both BFL1 alleles as assessed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 3F ) . In one allele there is a 24 base pair ( bp ) in-frame deletion removing a critical loop prior to the BH3 binding cleft and the other a 29 bp deletion in the BFL1 gene resulting in a frameshift mutation and a subsequent premature stop codon at amino acid 50 of the BFL-1 protein . These deletions were clearly evident by RT-PCR ( Figure 3F ) , and , consequently , the mutant ΔBFL-1 LCL expressed significantly reduced levels of BFL-1 mRNA as compared to WT LCL , LCL expressing Cas9 alone or Cas9-expressing LCLs targeting AAVS1 as a negative control ( Figure 3G ) . ΔBFL-1 LCLs were significantly more sensitive to treatment with a combination of ABT-737 and A-1210 relative to WT , Cas9 , or AAVS1 sgRNA control LCLs ( Figure 3H ) . These data support the hypothesis defined by our BH3 profiling data that LCLs depend on BFL-1 , MCL-1 , and BCL-2 to protect from apoptosis induced by viral oncoprotein-driven proliferation . A hallmark of B cell biology is rapid proliferation in response to antigen and cytokines leading to maturation via germinal center reactions into the memory and plasma cell lineages ( Goodnow et al . , 2010 ) . In cell culture , mitogens such as the TLR9 ligand CpG DNA as well as T cell derived CD40 ligand and IL-4 ( CD40L/IL-4 ) promote B cell proliferation similar to EBV infection ( Elgueta et al . , 2009; Krieg et al . , 1995; Nikitin et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4A–C ) . To assess whether EBV-mediated ABT-737 resistance was linked to B cell proliferation per se or was specific to EBV infection , we stimulated primary B cells with CpG or CD40L/IL-4 and queried survival . We found that , while EBV induced marked ABT-737 resistance ( IC50 ~3–4 µM ) , both CpG and CD40L/IL-4 stimulated B cells were significantly more sensitive to ABT-737 ( IC50 ~200 nM ) ( Figure 4D–E ) . Consistently , mitogen-stimulated proliferating B cells had increased caspase 3/7 activity and Annexin V positivity following ABT-737 treatment ( Figure 4F–G ) while EBV-infected cells displayed only marginally increased activity above basal levels ( Figure 2D–E ) . These data strongly support the hypothesis that resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is specific to EBV-induced proliferation . We next sought to characterize the EBV factors necessary for ABT-737 resistance . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 013Figure 4 . Resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is virus specific .

Of key importance is EBNA2 , a protein encoded initially by transcripts from the B cell-specific viral W promoter ( Wp ) . EBNA2 subsequently activates the viral C promoter ( Cp ) just upstream of Wp which drives increased expression of EBNA2 as well as the other EBNAs ( Price and Luftig , 2014; Woisetschlaeger et al . , 1991 ) ( Figure 5A ) . To assess the role of EBNA2 in ABT-737 resistance of early-infected cells , we used an EBNA2-deleted strain of EBV called P3HR1 ( Hinuma et al . , 1967 ) . Since the EBNA2 deletion in P3HR1 renders the virus incapable of inducing proliferation and transforming primary B cells ( Miller et al . , 1974 ) , we compared the ABT-737 sensitivity of P3HR1-infected cells induced to proliferate using the TLR9 ligand CpG ( P3HR1+CpG ) to uninfected B cells treated with CpG . P3HR1 infection did not alter the sensitivity of CpG-treated proliferating B cells to ABT-737 ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , the prototypical transforming strain , B95-8 , induced marked ABT-737 resistance in the presence or absence of CpG ( Figure 5B ) . These data implicate EBNA2 as a key determinant of the ABT-737 resistance phenotype . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 015Figure 5 . EBV-induced resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is mediated by EBNA3A .

Average IC50 is shown ( inset ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 018 Since EBNA2 controls the expression of other EBV latency genes , it was important to assess the expression of these genes during early P3HR1 and B95-8 infection . At 2 days post-infection , a time point at which ABT-737 resistance first emerges ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , P3HR1-infected cells express high levels of Wp-driven transcripts , but significantly less Cp-driven transcripts including EBNA2 , EBNA3A , and EBNA3C relative to B95-8 infected cells ( Figure 5C ) . As recent work indicates that the viral BCL-2 homologue , BHRF1 , is expressed from Wp during primary B cell infection ( Kelly et al . , 2009 ) and over-expression of BHRF1 can prevent apoptosis induced by ABT-737 in mouse cells ( Kvansakul et al . , 2010 ) , it was important to analyze BHRF1 expression . We found that P3HR1-infected cells expressed similar levels of BHRF1 as B95-8 infected cells ( Figure 5C ) . Therefore , BHRF1 was not associated with ABT-737 resistance in early-infected B cells . Resistance to ABT-737 could be conferred by EBNA2 or by a downstream target such as the EBNA3 proteins . While EBNA3A and EBNA3C are both important for B cell transformation , EBNA3A- and EBNA3C-deleted viruses can induce B cell proliferation for several weeks in culture before aborting long-term outgrowth ( Anderton et al . , 2008; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . To explore the potential role of the EBNA3 proteins in mediating ABT-737 resistance , we infected PBMCs with mutant strains of EBV deleted for EBNA3A or EBNA3C ( △3A , △3C ) , and treated them with ABT-737 at 3 . 5 dpi then assayed for survival at 7 dpi as before . While △3C-infected proliferating B cells were resistant to ABT-737 ( IC50 ~3 µM ) similar to WT B95-8-infected cells ( IC50 ~4 µM ) , the △3A-infected proliferating B cells remained highly sensitive to ABT-737 ( ~200 nM ) ( Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , from our initial infections we were able to derive a △3A LCL , similar to that reported by others ( Hertle et al . , 2009; Skalska et al . , 2010 ) , and we again observed enhanced sensitivity to ABT-737 and ABT-199 in the △3A LCL ( IC50 ~60 nM and ~180 nM , respectively ) relative to a donor-matched WT LCL ( IC50 ~4 µM ) ( Figure 5E , Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . This result was unexpected as LMP1-mediated NFκB activity in a △3A LCL should induce BFL-1 to rescue ABT-737 resistance ( D'Souza et al . , 2004; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 1E ) . To further characterize the nature of EBNA3A-mediated ABT-737 resistance , we subjected △3A and WT LCLs from the same donor to BH3 profiling . We found that the △3A LCL , in contrast to WT , was sensitive to both the Bad and Bmf peptides indicating BCL-2 dependence and an absence of BFL-1 and MCL-1 protection similar to the uninfected B cell state ( Figure 6A ) . Mechanistically , we found that △3A LCLs expressed significantly less BFL-1 at the mRNA level , while the BCL-2 and MCL-1 mRNA levels were similar to WT , if not slightly elevated ( Figure 6B and additional clones in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) . Loss of BFL-1 mRNA expression was not due to selective pressure applied during outgrowth of △3A LCL as EBNA3A-ERT2 fusion protein expressing LCLs lost or gained BFL-1 expression upon HT withdrawal or addition , respectively , in a stable LCL ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C ) . While BH3-profiling predicted a loss of MCL-1 activity , MCL-1 mRNA , protein , and protein stability were unchanged in the △3A LCL compared to WT ( Figure 6B–D ) . Instead , we discovered that MCL-1 localization to mitochondria was defective in the △3A LCL ( Figure 6E ) . These data strongly corroborate the BH3 profiling results , which indicated a lost of MCL-1 acitivity at the mitochondria . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 019Figure 6 . EBV EBNA3A is required for MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription . ( A ) BH3 profile shows increased sensitivity to Bad and Bmf peptides in EBNA3A-deleted LCLs compared to wildtype LCLs , indicative of a BCL-2 dependence .

Primer pairs for Myo were used as a negative control , CXCL10 as an EBNA3A-repressed control , and miR221/222 as an EBNA3A-activated control . Primer pairs surrounding the BFL-1 TSS are shown annotated in panel ( I ) in their proper locations .

( H ) Chromatin conformation capture ( CCC ) was performed on WT and △3A LCLs , and the BFL-1 loci were interrogated for interaction after digesting with HindIII .

( C ) Same as in ( B ) , but EBNA3A is now being induced and BFL-1 mRNA levels assayed as compared to cells that have never expressed EBNA3A ( Never HT ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 021 We further sought to determine how EBNA3A regulates BFL-1 and specifically to characterize whether the loss of BFL-1 mRNA in the △3A LCL was due to a transcriptional defect ( Figure 6B ) . Indeed , when we isolated nascent mRNAs using a thiolated-RNA pull down method we found that △3A LCLs were only transcribing ~15% as much BFL-1 mRNA as WT LCLs ( Figure 6F ) . Furthermore , we found that decreased BFL-1 transcription in △3A LCLs was correlated with decreased RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) , activated Pol II ( phospho Serine 5 ) , and activating histone marks ( H3K27ac , H3K9ac , and H3K4me3 ) accumulating at the BFL-1 transcription start site ( TSS ) ( Figure 6G ) . EBNA3 proteins often regulate gene expression through long-range enhancers ( Bazot et al . , 2015; McClellan et al . , 2013; Schmidt et al . , 2015 ) . To evaluate the role of EBNA3A in regulating chromatin structure to promote BFL-1 transcription , we used chromatin conformation capture to query the interactions between regions of open chromatin up- and downstream of the BFL-1 gene in WT and △3A LCLs . We discovered two genomic regions upstream of the BFL-1 gene that were strongly associated with the TSS in WT LCLs but less so in △3A LCLs ( Figure 6H ) . Using LCL ChIP-Seq data ( Schmidt et al . , 2015; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , we found that one locus is bound by EBNA3A within a known EBV Super Enhancer ( 39 kb upstream of the BFL-1 TSS ) and the other region contains a single RelA peak , an NFκB transcription factor subunit strongly activated by LMP1 ( Zhao et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 6I ) . These data support an important new role for EBNA3A in coordinating NFκB-mediated regulation of BFL-1 transcription in LCLs . Finally , to demonstrate that EBNA3A is responsible for ABT-737 resistance in EBV-infected B cells , we rescued EBNA3A expression in trans in △3A LCLs . We found that EBNA3A re-expression was sufficient to restore ABT-737 resistance similar to WT LCLs ( Figure 6J–K ) . Therefore , we conclude that EBNA3A plays an important role in EBV-mediated resistance to BCL-2 antagonists and survival in response to potent proliferative signals during both early and late stages of B cell growth transformation . \n",
            " Suppression of apoptosis by EBV is essential for establishment of latent infection in the immune-competent host and promotes tumorigenesis in the immune suppressed host . While EBV encodes two putative BCL-2 homologues , these proteins are not required for survival after the first 24 hr following B cell infection ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt , 2005 ) . Rather , constitutive NFκB signaling from the viral oncoprotein LMP1 , a TNFR homologue , is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected , proliferating cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al . , 2000; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . However , the initial burst of B cell proliferation induced by EBV is driven by expression of the viral EBNA transcription factors ( EBNA1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , and LP ) in the absence of appreciable LMP1 or NFκB activity ( Price et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , this early period of hyper-proliferation activates a growth-suppressive DNA damage response , which would be expected to promote apoptosis ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . We , therefore , sought to identify the mechanism of survival during early infection by using BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial control of apoptosis prior to and through latent EBV infection and outgrowth of primary human B cells into LCLs . While BH3 profiling has been previously performed on virus-infected cells ( Cojohari et al . , 2015 ) , this study focused on HCMV and was limited to a single EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line , Akata , which expresses only the viral EBNA1 protein . In our BH3 profiling study , we found that mature human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival while EBV latent infection further suppressed apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL-1 , followed by BFL-1 . Mechanistically , we identified a new and unique role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation . The importance of EBNA3A in B cell transformation and survival was previously recognized , but our studies now define the molecular basis for the inhibition of apoptosis . While both EBNA3A and EBNA3C suppress the pro-apoptotic protein Bim ( Paschos et al . , 2009 ) , only EBNA3A was required to mitigate resistance to a BCL2 antagonist through outgrowth . EBNA3A regulated the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription . Transcription of BFL-1 was previously shown to be regulated by the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 ( Pegman et al . , 2006 ) as well as LMP1-induced NFκB ( Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . Our work now indicates that EBNA3A coordinates a chromatin architecture through an EBV super enhancer that facilitates NFκB-mediated activation of BFL-1 transcription . Therefore , our studies highlight a new cooperative role among EBNA3A , EBNA2 , and LMP1 in transcriptional activation important for EBV-immortalized cell survival . The importance of MCL-1 in early EBV-infected human B cells coupled with the critical role of MCL-1 in germinal center ( GC ) formation and memory B cell survival in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al . , 2010 ) is consistent with the GC model of EBV infection . The GC model posits that EBV infection of naïve B cells promotes B cell maturation mimicking the GC reaction to access the long-lived memory B cell compartment and thus persisting for the lifetime of the host ( Burns et al . , 2015; Roughan and Thorley-Lawson , 2009 ) . Our data support this model in that early infection of B cells by EBV promotes MCL-1 as a critical apoptotic regulator similar that observed for GC B cells in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , MCL-1 copy number gains and mutations are often found in B cell lymphomas ( Wenzel et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , the mechanism by which EBNA3A enhances MCL-1 function at the mitochondria may provide broad insight into apoptotic regulation during B-cell maturation and lymphomagenesis . The early phase of EBV infection where EBNAs are expressed with little or no expression of LMPs is known as latency IIb ( Price and Luftig , 2015 ) . The latency IIb expression pattern has also been observed by immuno-histochemical analysis in EBV-positive HIV-associated lymphomas , post-transplant lymphomas , in acute infectious mononucleosis , and in tumors of humanized mouse models of EBV infection ( Price and Luftig , 2015 ) . Indeed , a recent study found that an EBV recombinant lacking LMP1 was capable of forming B cell tumors in a humanized mouse model ( Ma et al . , 2015 ) . The survival of these cells as well as those in other latency IIb expressing tissues likely depends on EBNA3A and MCL-1 , while latency III cells expressing LMP proteins and high level NFκB signaling are likely to be less primed and to rely on BFL-1 . As BH3 profiling has been a powerful predictive tool for chemotherapeutic responses in leukemias ( Montero et al . , 2015 ) , our new findings suggest that such an approach could allow for better treatment decisions for EBV-associated malignancies . \n",
            " Buffy coats were obtained from normal human donors through the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center ( Houston , TX ) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated by Ficoll Histopaque-1077 gradient ( Sigma , H8889 ) . CD19+ B cells were purified from PBMCs using the BD iMag Negative Isolation Kit ( BD , 558007 ) . Lymphoblastoid cell lines were generated as previously described ( Price et al . , 2012 ) and maintained in RPMI plus 10% FBS ( Corning ) , 2 mM L-Glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 μg/ml streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . B95-8 strain of Epstein-Barr virus was produced from the B95-8 Z-HT cell line as previously described ( Johannsen et al . , 2004 ) . P3HR1 was generated from P3HR1 Z-HT cells ( kind gift of Elliott Kieff , Harvard Medical School ) . Two independent sources of EBNA3A and EBNA3C deletion viruses were used in these studies for validation as well as an EBNA3A-ERT2 regulated recombinant ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . Detailed information on mutant viruses below . TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotide ( ODN 2006 ) was purchased from IDT and used at 2 . 5 µg/ml ( Krieg et al . , 1995 ) . Human recombinant interleukin-4 ( PeproTech , AF200-04 ) was used at 20 ng/mL . HA-tagged CD40 ligand was purchased from ( R&D Systems , 6420 CL ) and used at 5 ng/ml in combination with an anti-HA cross-linking peptide ( R&D Systems , MAB060; RRID:AB_10719128 ) at a concentration of 0 . 2 µg/µl . Initial BH3 profiling experiments were performed with cell populations and lines that were not mycoplasma tested . However , subsequently we instituted routine mycoplasmia testing using a PCR-detection kit ( Sigma-Aldrich , MP0035-1KT ) . While the majority of cell lines were negative for mycoplasma , we did detect mycoplasma in some lines . These lines were cured with ciprofloxacin treatment . We repeated several key experiments in those lines that were found to be positive and then cured , including ABT-737 and ABT-199 sensitivity assays , and found that mycoplasma contamination had no bearing on the results . Two independent sources of EBNA3A and EBNA3C deletion viruses were used in these studies for validation . One set was previously described ( Anderton et al . , 2008 ) . The other was generated by en passant mutagenesis of the EBV p2089 BACmid ( Delecluse et al . , 1998 ) using GS1783 E . coli ( Braman , 2010 ) . Primer sequences used to generate these mutants are listed in Supplementary file 1 . After screening , desired EBV BACmids were transferred to BM2710 E . coli which were then used to infect 293 cells as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2005 ) . Recombinant viruses were produced by co-transfecting BAC-containing , selected 293 cells with pCDNA3-2670-gp110 , pSG5-Zta , and pCDNA3-Rta into cells using polyethylenimine ( PEI ) and OptiMEM ( Invitrogen ) . 24 hr after transfection , media was changed to antibiotic-free 10% FBS containing RPMI 1640 and harvested 48 hr afterwards . After harvesting , transfected cells were replenished with fresh media for 24 hr , at which point virus was harvested again . Harvests were pooled and concentrated 100-fold in a 100 kDa Amicon spin-filter . In addition to the EBNA3A deletion and stop variants , a recombinant virus was used that encodes EBNA3A-ERT2 , which is a fusion of a modified estrogen receptor to EBNA3A . This virus was previously used to define EBNA3A regulated genes and its generation was described here ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . EBV infections were performed by adding 100 µL B95-8 virus ( from Z-HT supernatants ) or 200 µL P3HR1 virus to 1 × 106 PBMCs for 1 hr at 37°C in a CO2 incubator followed by washing the cells once with PBS and resuspending cells in RPMI with 15% FBS serum ( Corning ) , 2 mM L-Glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 μg/ml streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) , and 0 . 5 µg/mL Cyclosporine A ( Sigma ) . Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . For P3HR1 infections , viral stocks were normalized to B95-8 by immunofluorescence of EBNA-LP in primary B cells two days post infection . For WT , △3A , and △3C BAC viruses , 1 × 105 green Raji units ( GRU; Raji , RRID:CVCL_2699 ) were used to infect 1 × 106 PBMCs as previously described ( Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . The BFL-1 CRISPR/Cas9 mutant LCL was generated by the Duke Functional Genomics Shared Resource . Cas9-expressing LCLs ( lentiCas9-EGFP; Addgene #63592 ) were transduced with one of three short-guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) that were specific to BFL-1 exon 1 and grown out under puromycin selection ( lentiGuide-Puro; Addgene #52963 ) . Each sgRNA was screened for efficiency of Cas9 cleavage by Surveyor nuclease assay and for reduced BFL-1 mRNA expression . LCLs transduced with the sgRNA resulting in both Cas9 cleavage of the target site and the most reduced mRNA expression were then serially diluted to obtain a clonal population . Clonality was ascertained by TOPO TA cloning ( Invitrogen , Cat #45003 ) . To track proliferation , cells were stained with CellTrace Violet ( Invitrogen , C34557 ) . Cells were first washed in FACS buffer ( 5% FBS in PBS ) , stained with the appropriate antibody for 30 min-1hr at 4°C in the dark , and then washed again before being analyzed on a BD FACS Canto II . Proliferating infected B cells were sorted to a pure population of CD19+/CellTraceVioletlo on a MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter at the Duke Cancer Institute Flow Cytometry Shared Resource . Mouse anti-human CD19 antibody ( clone 33-6-6; gift from Tom Tedder , Duke University Medical School ) conjugated with either APC or PE was used as a surface B-cell marker in flow cytometry . Plate-based BH3 profiling was performed on primary B cells , early-infected hyperproliferating B cells , and LCLs at 5 × 104 cells/well . Cells were resuspended at 2x and incubated for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) in T-EB solution containing 4 μM JC-1 , 40 ug/mL oligomycin , 0 . 02% digitonin , and 20 mM 2-mercaptoethonal . Peptides were diluted in T-EB at 2x concentration and aliquoted per well in a black 384-well plate ( Corning 3575 ) , to which the cell/dye solution was added 1:1 . The fluorescence at 590 nM from each well was read on a plate reader every 5 min at RT . Depolarization of the mitochondria was calculated as a percentage loss normalized to the solvent-only control ( DMSO , 0% depolarization ) and the positive control ( FCCP , 100% depolarization ) . Analysis was performed using technical triplicates of five biological replicates , where outliers were eliminated if there was poor signal or if the Puma2A inert control showed high background depolarization . Cells were pelleted and washed in PBS , and then lysed in 0 . 1% Triton-containing buffer with Complete protease inhibitors . All protein lysates were run on NuPage 4–12% gradient gels ( LifeTechnology ) and transferred to PVDF membrane ( GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and stained with primary antibody overnight at +4°C , followed by a wash and staining with secondary HRP-conjugated antibody for 1 hr at room temperature . All antibodies used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . Total RNA was isolated from cells by using a Qiagen RNeasy kit and then reverse transcribed to generate cDNA with the High Capacity cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Quantitative PCR was performed by using SYBR green ( Quanta Biosciences ) in an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus instrument . Results were normalized to SETDB1 , a control mRNA found to not change expression from resting B cells through EBV-immortalization ( Price et al . , 2012 ) or GNB2LI ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . Cells were treated with various concentrations of ABT-199 ( ChemieTek , CT-A199 ) , ABT-737 ( Selleckchem , S1002 ) , flavopiridol ( Sigma , F3055 ) , or A1210477 ( Selleckchem , S7790 ) . All drugs were resuspended in DMSO . Cells were stained with fluorescent conjugates of Annexin-V ( eBioscience , 88-8007-72; RRID:AB_2575165 ) or incubated with CellEvent Caspase 3/7 Green Detection Reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific , C10423 ) . Cell death is reported as a percentage of Annexin-V positive or caspase 3/7-positive of total events . Survival is plotted as the percentage of CD19+ , proliferating B cells normalized by input volume using the FACS Canto II high-throughput 96-well sampler to DMSO-treated control cells . Protein stability was assayed by incubating LCLs in 15 µM cycloheximide ( Sigma , C1988 ) . Time points were taken immediately before addition ( 0 min ) , and then at 30 , 60 , and 120 min after addition of cycloheximide and analyzed by western blot loading 10 µg of protein per lane . Mitochondria isolation was performed using a mitochondria isolation kit ( Thermo Scientific ) on 50 million cells . Cells were lysed with Reagents A , B , and C as supplied by the manufacturer’s kit . Mitochondrial pellets were lysed in 0 . 1% Triton lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors . Total , cytoplasmic , and mitochondrial fractions were measured by Bradford assay and 5 μg protein was loaded per lane . The ability to capture nascently transcribed RNA was modified from previously described work ( Payne et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , cells were treated with 200 µM 4-thiouridine ( 4sU ) for one hour before total RNA was harvested in 1 mL of TRIzol ( Life Technologies ) . Nascently transcribed RNA over this time period incorporated 4sU , which was subsequently biotinylated and pulled down using streptavidin MyOne C1 Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) . RNA was reverse transcribed and qPCR was performed as described above . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) was performed as described previously ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) using a Millipore ChIP assay kit ( 17-295 ) and sonicated with a standard Diagenode Bioruptor sonicator . All antibodies used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . Chromatin Conformation Capture ( CCC ) was performed as described previously ( Hagège et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , chromatin was crosslinked with formaldehyde and isolated from LCLs , whereupon it was digested overnight with the restriction enzyme HindIII . Digested chromatin was then diluted and ligated overnight . Reversal of crosslinks , proteinase K digestion , and phenol-chloroform extraction yielded DNA circles that were assayed by TaqMan qPCR . All oligos and probes used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . pCEP-EBNA3A , an episomal expression vector , was introduced into LCLs using the MicroPorator MP-100 ( Digital Bio ) . Cells were incubated with DNA and shocked at 1300V for 1 pulse of 30 ms and then recovered in 15% FBS containing RPMI . Cells were co-transfected with an additional pCEP-TdTomato plasmid to mark transfected cells with red fluorescence . Student’s 2-way ANOVA and two-tailed t-test were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 software . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , and ***p<0 . 001 were considered significant . IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad and 95% confidence intervals were reported .\n"

            "## Abstract\n",
            "Latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is causally linked to several human cancers . EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation . The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells . However , during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis . Therefore , we sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection . We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells ( BCL-2 ) to early-infected ( MCL-1/BCL-2 ) and immortalized cells ( BFL-1 ) . This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein . This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis . \n",

            "## Introduction\n",
            " An estimated 15% of cancers worldwide are caused by infectious agents like viruses . Of these , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) was the first human tumor virus discovered and is associated with malignancies of both B lymphocyte and epithelial cell origin . Normally , T cells prevent the development of EBV-associated malignancies and the virus persists quiescently in latently-infected memory B cells . As a result , nearly all adults in the world are latently infected ( Longnecker et al . , 2013 ) , making EBV a particularly widespread and successful pathogen . However , in the absence of a healthy immune system , such as following organ transplant or HIV infection , EBV can transform B cells leading to markedly increased rates of lymphoma in these populations . Primary human B cell infection in vitro by EBV leads to their growth transformation and serves as a model for oncogenesis in EBV-associated lymphomas . This process requires the expression of six viral latent genes: Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 ( EBNA1 ) , EBNA2 , EBNA-LP , EBNA3A , EBNA3C and Latent Membrane Protein 1 ( LMP1 ) ( Longnecker et al . , 2013 ) . EBNA2 , the major viral transcriptional activator and the first to be expressed upon infection , upregulates expression of the other viral EBNA genes as well as host genes ( Wang et al . , 2000; Zimber-Strobl and Strobl , 2001 ) . EBNA2 also activates the expression of the viral oncoprotein LMP1 , which drives the immortalization of the infected B cell into a lymphoblastoid cell line , or LCL , that proliferates indefinitely in culture . Together , the EBV latent oncoproteins mimic key aspects of normal B cell biology , promote proliferation , and inhibit the host innate tumor suppressor response to uncontrolled proliferation ( Allday , 2013; Price and Luftig , 2014 ) . It is well-established that the LMP1 oncoprotein is necessary for continued LCL growth and survival ( Kaye et al . , 1993; Zimber-Strobl et al . , 1996 ) . LMP1 mimics a pro-survival TNF receptor that signals constitutively through the NFκB pathway to promote proliferation and suppress apoptosis in transformed cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al . , 2000; Okan et al . , 1995; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . In fact , inhibition of the NFκB pathway activated downstream of LMP1 leads to apoptosis in LCLs . However , recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that , early after infection , B cells rapidly proliferate despite low levels of LMP1 expression and NFκB activation ( Nikitin et al . , 2010; Price et al . , 2012 ) . Surprisingly , these early-infected cells also show no overt signs of apoptosis despite strong activation of the cellular DNA damage response ( Nikitin et al . , 2014 ) . This suggests that in early-infected cells , there is a viral-mediated mechanism independent of LMP1 signaling that promotes survival . Several LMP1-independent mechanisms to subvert apoptosis have been described . For example , the viral BCL-2 homologue BHRF1 confers chemoresistance in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) ( Kvansakul et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , the viral BHRF1 and BALF1 proteins exert non-redundant roles in protecting initially infected cells from apoptosis ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt , 2005 ) . In addition , expression of the EBNA3 proteins induces resistance to apoptosis in BL cells and primary B cells by downregulating Bim expression ( Paschos et al . , 2009; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) , thereby making infected cells less ‘primed’ for apoptosis . The EBNA3 family is also known to epigenetically downregulate additional human genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis ( Allday , 2013; Harth-Hertle et al . , 2013; Hertle et al . , 2009; Paschos et al . , 2012; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . It has been shown that the EBNA3 proteins mediate these epigenetic effects , in part , via interacting with additional proteins in such a way that chromatin architecture can be dramatically altered ( Bazot et al . , 2015; McClellan et al . , 2013 ) . While thought to be generally repressive in nature , recent work has shown that in some instances EBNA3 proteins can activate gene transcription ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . In sum , viral proteins confer several survival advantages to infected cells , which often results in EBV-positive lymphomas that are more difficult to treat than their EBV-negative counterparts ( Kelly et al . , 2006 ) . The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is controlled by complex protein—protein interactions at the surface of mitochondria that regulate the release of cytochrome c ( Youle and Strasser , 2008 ) . These functional interactions can be interrogated with an established approach called ‘BH3 profiling’ , which uses peptides derived from BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins to identify the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members important for preventing apoptosis in a particular cell ( Del Gaizo Moore and Letai , 2013; Deng et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , molecular characterization of the interface between BH3 domains of these proteins has allowed for the creation of a new class of small molecule inhibitors that promote apoptosis directly in sensitive cell types ( Billard , 2013; Oltersdorf et al . , 2005 ) . These so-called ‘BH3 mimetics’ are highly specific and show great promise in clinical trials ( Letai , 2008 ) . In this study , we characterized the BH3 profile of uninfected and EBV-infected primary human B cells from early proliferation through long-term outgrowth . We validated these profiles using BH3 mimetics and , importantly , identified a novel virus-specific transition in survival mechanisms between early and late stages of latent infection with implications for therapy of EBV-associated malignancies . \n",

            "## Results\n",
            " Previously , our laboratory has identified an early period after EBV infection of primary human B cells where , despite robust virus-mediated proliferation and activation of the pro-apoptotic DNA damage response , there is little expression of the key viral survival factor LMP1 ( Price et al . , 2012 ) . In order to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1 and NFκB activity early after infection , as well as through long-term outgrowth , we performed BH3 profiling to query apoptotic priming at the mitochondria of infected cells . Briefly , this technique works by permeabilizing cells , staining with a mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye , and then treating cells with peptides derived from the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins , including the activator BH3-only protein BIM and the sensitizer BH3-only proteins BAD , PUMA , NOXA , BMF , and HRK ( Figure 1A ) . By measuring mitochondrial depolarization induced by the activator BH3 peptide , BIM , and the pan-apoptotic sensitizer , PUMA , BH3 profiling can measure the overall ‘priming’ of the cells for apoptosis ( that is , the cell's distance from the apoptotic threshold ) . Further , by measuring depolarization induced by the sensitizer BH3 peptides BAD , NOXA , BMF , and HRK , BH3 profiling can also determine the cell’s specific dependence on particular anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins , including BCL-2 , BCL-XL , MCL-1 , and BFL-1 ( Del Gaizo Moore and Letai , 2013 ) . We BH3 profiled three cell states: ( i ) uninfected B cells purified from the peripheral blood of normal human donors ( B Cell ) , ( ii ) FACS-purified proliferating EBV-infected B cells seven days post-infection ( Prolif ) , and ( iii ) the resulting EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) derived five weeks post-infection from the same donors ( Figure 1B , C ) . Both latently infected cell populations are 100% EBV-positive as shown previously by immuno-fluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 006 BH3 profiling revealed that EBV infection of primary B cells only modestly reduces overall mitochondrial priming ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 compare 10 µM Puma from B to Prolif and 1 µM Bim from B/Prolif to LCL ) . However , the BH3 profiles revealed marked changes in the BCL-2 family dependencies between the groups suggesting specific , testable hypotheses ( Figure 1D ) . For instance , a cell dependent on BCL-2 or BCL-w for survival would exhibit mitochondrial depolarization upon exposure to Bad , Puma , or Bmf peptides , while a cell dependent upon MCL-1 would depolarize upon exposure to Noxa , Puma , or Bmf peptides . Uninfected B cells depolarized their mitochondria upon treatment with Bad , Puma , or Bmf peptides , but not Noxa or Hrk peptides , indicating reliance on BCL-2 or BCL-w as a pro-survival BCL2 family member ( Figure 1E ) . EBV-infected proliferating B cells ( Prolif ) lost sensitivity to the Bad peptide but remained sensitive to Puma and Bmf , supporting a survival mechanism reliant on both MCL-1 , to block Bad-induced depolarization , and BCL-2/BCL-w , to block Noxa-induced depolarization ( Figure 1E ) . Finally , LCLs lost sensitivity to Bmf , but sensitivity to Puma did not change between Prolif and LCLs , suggesting additional BFL-1 mediated pro-survival effects in LCLs ( Figure 1E ) . We hypothesized that EBV infection reduces the dependence of B cells on BCL-2 , BCL-xL , or BCL-w for survival given the loss of Bad sensitivity between uninfected and early-infected B cells ( Figure 1E ) . To test this , we treated PBMCs with small molecule BH3 mimetics either concurrent with EBV infection or at the onset of proliferation ( 3 . 5 days post-infection ( dpi ) ) and measured the number of proliferating EBV-infected B cells at 7 dpi using flow cytometry and the proliferation tracking dye CellTrace Violet ( Figure 2A ) . We also assayed the sensitivity of monoclonal LCLs to BH3 mimetic treatment for an equivalent period of time ( Figure 2A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 007Figure 2 .

Source data for cell counts and apoptosis assays performed with BH3 mimetics targeting BCL-2 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 008 We first tested the sensitivity of EBV-infected cells to ABT-737 , a potent small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2 , BCL-xL , and BCL-w ( Oltersdorf et al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with dependence of uninfected B cells on these BCL-2 family members predicted by BH3 profiling , treatment with ABT-737 concurrent with EBV infection resulted in an IC50 in proliferating B cells of ~10 nM ( Figure 2B–C ) . However , when ABT-737 was added to EBV-infected cells after the onset of virus-induced proliferation or to immortalized LCLs we observed high-level ABT-737 resistance with an IC50of ~2–4 µM ( Figure 2B–C ) . ABT-737 promoted apoptosis as measured by caspase 3/7 activity and Annexin V positivity in uninfected B cells , while proliferating cells at 7 dpi and EBV transformed LCLs were resistant to apoptosis induction ( Figure 2D–E ) . We next sought to confirm BCL-2 as the specific anti-apoptotic protein important for uninfected B cell survival and to further validate our BH3 profiling results . To do this , we used ABT-199 , a specific inhibitor of BCL-2 with minimal off-target effects on BCL-xL or BCL-w ( Souers et al . , 2013 ) . Similar to ABT-737 , EBV induced potent resistance to ABT-199 ( Figure 2F–G ) . Therefore , uninfected human peripheral blood CD19+ B cells depend on BCL-2 for survival and EBV upregulates additional survival proteins to potently suppress apoptosis induced by BCL-2 antagonism . Our BH3 profiling experiments predicted that EBV-infected B cells are less primed for apoptosis due to the combined protective effects of MCL-1 and BCL-2 during early proliferation with additional protection afforded by BFL-1 in immortalized B cells ( Figure 1E ) . To functionally characterize EBV-regulated survival , we first analyzed BCL-2 family member mRNA expression through B cell outgrowth . We observed that MCL-1 mRNA increased from uninfected B to EBV-infected and proliferating B cells and was further increased in LCLs ( Figure 3A ) . Over the same infection time course , both BCL-2 and BFL-1 were initially downregulated in early proliferating B cells relative to uninfected B cells , then upregulated during LCL outgrowth . These data are consistent with prior transcriptomic analyses from our group ( Price et al . , 2012 ) and others indicating that BCL-2 and BFL-1 are both ultimately upregulated by EBV ( D'Souza et al . , 2004; Henderson et al . , 1991 ) . BCL-2 and MCL-1 protein levels mirror their respective mRNA expression levels during B cell outgrowth ( Figure 3B , quantified in Figure 3C; note there is no viable BFL-1 antibody ) . MCL-1 has been known to be expressed as different isoforms , a long ( MCL-1 ( L ) ) and a short ( MCL-1 ( S ) ) ( Perciavalle et al . , 2012 ) . While the MCL-1 ( L ) isoform is associated with anti-apoptotic activity , MCL1 ( S ) appears to be more important for mitochondrial maintenance; thus , for the scope of this study , we focused primarily on MCL-1 ( L ) , referred to as MCL-1 . The aforementioned data indicate that ABT-737 resistance coincides with MCL-1 induction . We therefore sought to test the importance of MCL-1 in promoting EBV-induced ABT-737 resistance . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 009Figure 3 .

Treatment of EBV-infected proliferating B cells at 7dpi or LCLs with either ABT-737 , ABT-199 , or a specific MCL-1 inhibitor A1210477 ( A-1210 ) induced minimal apoptosis ( Figure 3D–E ) . However , when cells were treated with both A-1210 and either ABT-737 or ABT-199 , early proliferating cells , but not LCLs , displayed elevated markers of apoptosis ( Figure 3D–E ) . The combined action of ABT-199 and A-1210 supports the hypothesis generated by BH3 profiling that early-infected cells are more dependent upon MCL-1 and BCL-2 for survival than are LCLs . Further corroborating these findings , we found that indirect inhibition of MCL-1 with flavopiridol led to sensitivity of early-infected cells to BCL-2 antagonists . MCL-1 is a highly labile transcript and protein , and its expression is known to be sensitive to RNA polymerase II stalling induced by CDK9 inhibition ( Gojo et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , the CDK9 inhibitor , flavopiridol , induced rapid decreases in MCL-1 mRNA and protein , while leaving BCL-2 and BFL-1 levels largely unaffected ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B ) . Supporting our A-1210 data , we found that early proliferating cells were more sensitive to apoptosis induced by a combination of flavopirodol and ABT-737 than LCLs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ) ( Leverson et al . , 2015 ) . To determine if BFL-1 was important for survival in LCLs , we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the BFL1 ( Bcl2a1 ) coding sequence . We successfully generated a clonal LCL with deletions in both BFL1 alleles as assessed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 3F ) . In one allele there is a 24 base pair ( bp ) in-frame deletion removing a critical loop prior to the BH3 binding cleft and the other a 29 bp deletion in the BFL1 gene resulting in a frameshift mutation and a subsequent premature stop codon at amino acid 50 of the BFL-1 protein . These deletions were clearly evident by RT-PCR ( Figure 3F ) , and , consequently , the mutant ΔBFL-1 LCL expressed significantly reduced levels of BFL-1 mRNA as compared to WT LCL , LCL expressing Cas9 alone or Cas9-expressing LCLs targeting AAVS1 as a negative control ( Figure 3G ) . ΔBFL-1 LCLs were significantly more sensitive to treatment with a combination of ABT-737 and A-1210 relative to WT , Cas9 , or AAVS1 sgRNA control LCLs ( Figure 3H ) . These data support the hypothesis defined by our BH3 profiling data that LCLs depend on BFL-1 , MCL-1 , and BCL-2 to protect from apoptosis induced by viral oncoprotein-driven proliferation . A hallmark of B cell biology is rapid proliferation in response to antigen and cytokines leading to maturation via germinal center reactions into the memory and plasma cell lineages ( Goodnow et al . , 2010 ) . In cell culture , mitogens such as the TLR9 ligand CpG DNA as well as T cell derived CD40 ligand and IL-4 ( CD40L/IL-4 ) promote B cell proliferation similar to EBV infection ( Elgueta et al . , 2009; Krieg et al . , 1995; Nikitin et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4A–C ) . To assess whether EBV-mediated ABT-737 resistance was linked to B cell proliferation per se or was specific to EBV infection , we stimulated primary B cells with CpG or CD40L/IL-4 and queried survival . We found that , while EBV induced marked ABT-737 resistance ( IC50 ~3–4 µM ) , both CpG and CD40L/IL-4 stimulated B cells were significantly more sensitive to ABT-737 ( IC50 ~200 nM ) ( Figure 4D–E ) . Consistently , mitogen-stimulated proliferating B cells had increased caspase 3/7 activity and Annexin V positivity following ABT-737 treatment ( Figure 4F–G ) while EBV-infected cells displayed only marginally increased activity above basal levels ( Figure 2D–E ) . These data strongly support the hypothesis that resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is specific to EBV-induced proliferation . We next sought to characterize the EBV factors necessary for ABT-737 resistance . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 013Figure 4 . Resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is virus specific .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 014 EBV requires expression of protein products from the heavily spliced Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen ( EBNA ) transcriptional unit to promote B cell proliferation and survival ( Price and Luftig , 2014 ) . Of key importance is EBNA2 , a protein encoded initially by transcripts from the B cell-specific viral W promoter ( Wp ) . EBNA2 subsequently activates the viral C promoter ( Cp ) just upstream of Wp which drives increased expression of EBNA2 as well as the other EBNAs ( Price and Luftig , 2014; Woisetschlaeger et al . , 1991 ) ( Figure 5A ) . To assess the role of EBNA2 in ABT-737 resistance of early-infected cells , we used an EBNA2-deleted strain of EBV called P3HR1 ( Hinuma et al . , 1967 ) . Since the EBNA2 deletion in P3HR1 renders the virus incapable of inducing proliferation and transforming primary B cells ( Miller et al . , 1974 ) , we compared the ABT-737 sensitivity of P3HR1-infected cells induced to proliferate using the TLR9 ligand CpG ( P3HR1+CpG ) to uninfected B cells treated with CpG . P3HR1 infection did not alter the sensitivity of CpG-treated proliferating B cells to ABT-737 ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , the prototypical transforming strain , B95-8 , induced marked ABT-737 resistance in the presence or absence of CpG ( Figure 5B ) . These data implicate EBNA2 as a key determinant of the ABT-737 resistance phenotype . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 015Figure 5 . EBV-induced resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is mediated by EBNA3A .

Average IC50 is shown ( inset ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 018 Since EBNA2 controls the expression of other EBV latency genes , it was important to assess the expression of these genes during early P3HR1 and B95-8 infection . At 2 days post-infection , a time point at which ABT-737 resistance first emerges ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , P3HR1-infected cells express high levels of Wp-driven transcripts , but significantly less Cp-driven transcripts including EBNA2 , EBNA3A , and EBNA3C relative to B95-8 infected cells ( Figure 5C ) . As recent work indicates that the viral BCL-2 homologue , BHRF1 , is expressed from Wp during primary B cell infection ( Kelly et al . , 2009 ) and over-expression of BHRF1 can prevent apoptosis induced by ABT-737 in mouse cells ( Kvansakul et al . , 2010 ) , it was important to analyze BHRF1 expression . We found that P3HR1-infected cells expressed similar levels of BHRF1 as B95-8 infected cells ( Figure 5C ) . Therefore , BHRF1 was not associated with ABT-737 resistance in early-infected B cells . Resistance to ABT-737 could be conferred by EBNA2 or by a downstream target such as the EBNA3 proteins . While EBNA3A and EBNA3C are both important for B cell transformation , EBNA3A- and EBNA3C-deleted viruses can induce B cell proliferation for several weeks in culture before aborting long-term outgrowth ( Anderton et al . , 2008; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . To explore the potential role of the EBNA3 proteins in mediating ABT-737 resistance , we infected PBMCs with mutant strains of EBV deleted for EBNA3A or EBNA3C ( △3A , △3C ) , and treated them with ABT-737 at 3 . 5 dpi then assayed for survival at 7 dpi as before . While △3C-infected proliferating B cells were resistant to ABT-737 ( IC50 ~3 µM ) similar to WT B95-8-infected cells ( IC50 ~4 µM ) , the △3A-infected proliferating B cells remained highly sensitive to ABT-737 ( ~200 nM ) ( Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , from our initial infections we were able to derive a △3A LCL , similar to that reported by others ( Hertle et al . , 2009; Skalska et al . , 2010 ) , and we again observed enhanced sensitivity to ABT-737 and ABT-199 in the △3A LCL ( IC50 ~60 nM and ~180 nM , respectively ) relative to a donor-matched WT LCL ( IC50 ~4 µM ) ( Figure 5E , Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . This result was unexpected as LMP1-mediated NFκB activity in a △3A LCL should induce BFL-1 to rescue ABT-737 resistance ( D'Souza et al . , 2004; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 1E ) . To further characterize the nature of EBNA3A-mediated ABT-737 resistance , we subjected △3A and WT LCLs from the same donor to BH3 profiling . We found that the △3A LCL , in contrast to WT , was sensitive to both the Bad and Bmf peptides indicating BCL-2 dependence and an absence of BFL-1 and MCL-1 protection similar to the uninfected B cell state ( Figure 6A ) . Mechanistically , we found that △3A LCLs expressed significantly less BFL-1 at the mRNA level , while the BCL-2 and MCL-1 mRNA levels were similar to WT , if not slightly elevated ( Figure 6B and additional clones in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) . Loss of BFL-1 mRNA expression was not due to selective pressure applied during outgrowth of △3A LCL as EBNA3A-ERT2 fusion protein expressing LCLs lost or gained BFL-1 expression upon HT withdrawal or addition , respectively , in a stable LCL ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C ) . While BH3-profiling predicted a loss of MCL-1 activity , MCL-1 mRNA , protein , and protein stability were unchanged in the △3A LCL compared to WT ( Figure 6B–D ) . Instead , we discovered that MCL-1 localization to mitochondria was defective in the △3A LCL ( Figure 6E ) . These data strongly corroborate the BH3 profiling results , which indicated a lost of MCL-1 acitivity at the mitochondria . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 019Figure 6 .

( C ) Same as in ( B ) , but EBNA3A is now being induced and BFL-1 mRNA levels assayed as compared to cells that have never expressed EBNA3A ( Never HT ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22509 . 021 We further sought to determine how EBNA3A regulates BFL-1 and specifically to characterize whether the loss of BFL-1 mRNA in the △3A LCL was due to a transcriptional defect ( Figure 6B ) . Indeed , when we isolated nascent mRNAs using a thiolated-RNA pull down method we found that △3A LCLs were only transcribing ~15% as much BFL-1 mRNA as WT LCLs ( Figure 6F ) . Furthermore , we found that decreased BFL-1 transcription in △3A LCLs was correlated with decreased RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) , activated Pol II ( phospho Serine 5 ) , and activating histone marks ( H3K27ac , H3K9ac , and H3K4me3 ) accumulating at the BFL-1 transcription start site ( TSS ) ( Figure 6G ) . EBNA3 proteins often regulate gene expression through long-range enhancers ( Bazot et al . , 2015; McClellan et al . , 2013; Schmidt et al . , 2015 ) . To evaluate the role of EBNA3A in regulating chromatin structure to promote BFL-1 transcription , we used chromatin conformation capture to query the interactions between regions of open chromatin up- and downstream of the BFL-1 gene in WT and △3A LCLs . We discovered two genomic regions upstream of the BFL-1 gene that were strongly associated with the TSS in WT LCLs but less so in △3A LCLs ( Figure 6H ) . Using LCL ChIP-Seq data ( Schmidt et al . , 2015; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , we found that one locus is bound by EBNA3A within a known EBV Super Enhancer ( 39 kb upstream of the BFL-1 TSS ) and the other region contains a single RelA peak , an NFκB transcription factor subunit strongly activated by LMP1 ( Zhao et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 6I ) . These data support an important new role for EBNA3A in coordinating NFκB-mediated regulation of BFL-1 transcription in LCLs . Finally , to demonstrate that EBNA3A is responsible for ABT-737 resistance in EBV-infected B cells , we rescued EBNA3A expression in trans in △3A LCLs . We found that EBNA3A re-expression was sufficient to restore ABT-737 resistance similar to WT LCLs ( Figure 6J–K ) . Therefore , we conclude that EBNA3A plays an important role in EBV-mediated resistance to BCL-2 antagonists and survival in response to potent proliferative signals during both early and late stages of B cell growth transformation . \n",

            " Suppression of apoptosis by EBV is essential for establishment of latent infection in the immune-competent host and promotes tumorigenesis in the immune suppressed host . While EBV encodes two putative BCL-2 homologues , these proteins are not required for survival after the first 24 hr following B cell infection ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt , 2005 ) . Rather , constitutive NFκB signaling from the viral oncoprotein LMP1 , a TNFR homologue , is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected , proliferating cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al . , 2000; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . However , the initial burst of B cell proliferation induced by EBV is driven by expression of the viral EBNA transcription factors ( EBNA1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , and LP ) in the absence of appreciable LMP1 or NFκB activity ( Price et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , this early period of hyper-proliferation activates a growth-suppressive DNA damage response , which would be expected to promote apoptosis ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . We , therefore , sought to identify the mechanism of survival during early infection by using BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial control of apoptosis prior to and through latent EBV infection and outgrowth of primary human B cells into LCLs . While BH3 profiling has been previously performed on virus-infected cells ( Cojohari et al . , 2015 ) , this study focused on HCMV and was limited to a single EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line , Akata , which expresses only the viral EBNA1 protein . In our BH3 profiling study , we found that mature human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival while EBV latent infection further suppressed apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL-1 , followed by BFL-1 . Mechanistically , we identified a new and unique role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation . The importance of EBNA3A in B cell transformation and survival was previously recognized , but our studies now define the molecular basis for the inhibition of apoptosis . While both EBNA3A and EBNA3C suppress the pro-apoptotic protein Bim ( Paschos et al . , 2009 ) , only EBNA3A was required to mitigate resistance to a BCL2 antagonist through outgrowth . EBNA3A regulated the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription . Transcription of BFL-1 was previously shown to be regulated by the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 ( Pegman et al . , 2006 ) as well as LMP1-induced NFκB ( Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . Our work now indicates that EBNA3A coordinates a chromatin architecture through an EBV super enhancer that facilitates NFκB-mediated activation of BFL-1 transcription . Therefore , our studies highlight a new cooperative role among EBNA3A , EBNA2 , and LMP1 in transcriptional activation important for EBV-immortalized cell survival . The importance of MCL-1 in early EBV-infected human B cells coupled with the critical role of MCL-1 in germinal center ( GC ) formation and memory B cell survival in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al . , 2010 ) is consistent with the GC model of EBV infection . The GC model posits that EBV infection of naïve B cells promotes B cell maturation mimicking the GC reaction to access the long-lived memory B cell compartment and thus persisting for the lifetime of the host ( Burns et al . , 2015; Roughan and Thorley-Lawson , 2009 ) . Our data support this model in that early infection of B cells by EBV promotes MCL-1 as a critical apoptotic regulator similar that observed for GC B cells in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , MCL-1 copy number gains and mutations are often found in B cell lymphomas ( Wenzel et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , the mechanism by which EBNA3A enhances MCL-1 function at the mitochondria may provide broad insight into apoptotic regulation during B-cell maturation and lymphomagenesis . The early phase of EBV infection where EBNAs are expressed with little or no expression of LMPs is known as latency IIb ( Price and Luftig , 2015 ) . The latency IIb expression pattern has also been observed by immuno-histochemical analysis in EBV-positive HIV-associated lymphomas , post-transplant lymphomas , in acute infectious mononucleosis , and in tumors of humanized mouse models of EBV infection ( Price and Luftig , 2015 ) . Indeed , a recent study found that an EBV recombinant lacking LMP1 was capable of forming B cell tumors in a humanized mouse model ( Ma et al . , 2015 ) . The survival of these cells as well as those in other latency IIb expressing tissues likely depends on EBNA3A and MCL-1 , while latency III cells expressing LMP proteins and high level NFκB signaling are likely to be less primed and to rely on BFL-1 . As BH3 profiling has been a powerful predictive tool for chemotherapeutic responses in leukemias ( Montero et al . , 2015 ) , our new findings suggest that such an approach could allow for better treatment decisions for EBV-associated malignancies . \n",

            " Buffy coats were obtained from normal human donors through the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center ( Houston , TX ) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated by Ficoll Histopaque-1077 gradient ( Sigma , H8889 ) . CD19+ B cells were purified from PBMCs using the BD iMag Negative Isolation Kit ( BD , 558007 ) . Lymphoblastoid cell lines were generated as previously described ( Price et al . , 2012 ) and maintained in RPMI plus 10% FBS ( Corning ) , 2 mM L-Glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 μg/ml streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . B95-8 strain of Epstein-Barr virus was produced from the B95-8 Z-HT cell line as previously described ( Johannsen et al . , 2004 ) . P3HR1 was generated from P3HR1 Z-HT cells ( kind gift of Elliott Kieff , Harvard Medical School ) . Two independent sources of EBNA3A and EBNA3C deletion viruses were used in these studies for validation as well as an EBNA3A-ERT2 regulated recombinant ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . Detailed information on mutant viruses below . TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotide ( ODN 2006 ) was purchased from IDT and used at 2 . 5 µg/ml ( Krieg et al . , 1995 ) . Human recombinant interleukin-4 ( PeproTech , AF200-04 ) was used at 20 ng/mL . HA-tagged CD40 ligand was purchased from ( R&D Systems , 6420 CL ) and used at 5 ng/ml in combination with an anti-HA cross-linking peptide ( R&D Systems , MAB060; RRID:AB_10719128 ) at a concentration of 0 . 2 µg/µl . Initial BH3 profiling experiments were performed with cell populations and lines that were not mycoplasma tested . However , subsequently we instituted routine mycoplasmia testing using a PCR-detection kit ( Sigma-Aldrich , MP0035-1KT ) . While the majority of cell lines were negative for mycoplasma , we did detect mycoplasma in some lines . These lines were cured with ciprofloxacin treatment . We repeated several key experiments in those lines that were found to be positive and then cured , including ABT-737 and ABT-199 sensitivity assays , and found that mycoplasma contamination had no bearing on the results . Two independent sources of EBNA3A and EBNA3C deletion viruses were used in these studies for validation . One set was previously described ( Anderton et al . , 2008 ) . The other was generated by en passant mutagenesis of the EBV p2089 BACmid ( Delecluse et al . , 1998 ) using GS1783 E . coli ( Braman , 2010 ) . Primer sequences used to generate these mutants are listed in Supplementary file 1 . After screening , desired EBV BACmids were transferred to BM2710 E . coli which were then used to infect 293 cells as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2005 ) . Recombinant viruses were produced by co-transfecting BAC-containing , selected 293 cells with pCDNA3-2670-gp110 , pSG5-Zta , and pCDNA3-Rta into cells using polyethylenimine ( PEI ) and OptiMEM ( Invitrogen ) . 24 hr after transfection , media was changed to antibiotic-free 10% FBS containing RPMI 1640 and harvested 48 hr afterwards . After harvesting , transfected cells were replenished with fresh media for 24 hr , at which point virus was harvested again . Harvests were pooled and concentrated 100-fold in a 100 kDa Amicon spin-filter . In addition to the EBNA3A deletion and stop variants , a recombinant virus was used that encodes EBNA3A-ERT2 , which is a fusion of a modified estrogen receptor to EBNA3A . This virus was previously used to define EBNA3A regulated genes and its generation was described here ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . EBV infections were performed by adding 100 µL B95-8 virus ( from Z-HT supernatants ) or 200 µL P3HR1 virus to 1 × 106 PBMCs for 1 hr at 37°C in a CO2 incubator followed by washing the cells once with PBS and resuspending cells in RPMI with 15% FBS serum ( Corning ) , 2 mM L-Glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 μg/ml streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) , and 0 . 5 µg/mL Cyclosporine A ( Sigma ) . Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . For P3HR1 infections , viral stocks were normalized to B95-8 by immunofluorescence of EBNA-LP in primary B cells two days post infection . For WT , △3A , and △3C BAC viruses , 1 × 105 green Raji units ( GRU; Raji , RRID:CVCL_2699 ) were used to infect 1 × 106 PBMCs as previously described ( Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . The BFL-1 CRISPR/Cas9 mutant LCL was generated by the Duke Functional Genomics Shared Resource . Cas9-expressing LCLs ( lentiCas9-EGFP; Addgene #63592 ) were transduced with one of three short-guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) that were specific to BFL-1 exon 1 and grown out under puromycin selection ( lentiGuide-Puro; Addgene #52963 ) . Each sgRNA was screened for efficiency of Cas9 cleavage by Surveyor nuclease assay and for reduced BFL-1 mRNA expression . LCLs transduced with the sgRNA resulting in both Cas9 cleavage of the target site and the most reduced mRNA expression were then serially diluted to obtain a clonal population . Clonality was ascertained by TOPO TA cloning ( Invitrogen , Cat #45003 ) . To track proliferation , cells were stained with CellTrace Violet ( Invitrogen , C34557 ) . Cells were first washed in FACS buffer ( 5% FBS in PBS ) , stained with the appropriate antibody for 30 min-1hr at 4°C in the dark , and then washed again before being analyzed on a BD FACS Canto II . Proliferating infected B cells were sorted to a pure population of CD19+/CellTraceVioletlo on a MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter at the Duke Cancer Institute Flow Cytometry Shared Resource . Mouse anti-human CD19 antibody ( clone 33-6-6; gift from Tom Tedder , Duke University Medical School ) conjugated with either APC or PE was used as a surface B-cell marker in flow cytometry . Plate-based BH3 profiling was performed on primary B cells , early-infected hyperproliferating B cells , and LCLs at 5 × 104 cells/well . Cells were resuspended at 2x and incubated for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) in T-EB solution containing 4 μM JC-1 , 40 ug/mL oligomycin , 0 . 02% digitonin , and 20 mM 2-mercaptoethonal . Peptides were diluted in T-EB at 2x concentration and aliquoted per well in a black 384-well plate ( Corning 3575 ) , to which the cell/dye solution was added 1:1 . The fluorescence at 590 nM from each well was read on a plate reader every 5 min at RT . Depolarization of the mitochondria was calculated as a percentage loss normalized to the solvent-only control ( DMSO , 0% depolarization ) and the positive control ( FCCP , 100% depolarization ) . Analysis was performed using technical triplicates of five biological replicates , where outliers were eliminated if there was poor signal or if the Puma2A inert control showed high background depolarization . Cells were pelleted and washed in PBS , and then lysed in 0 . 1% Triton-containing buffer with Complete protease inhibitors . All protein lysates were run on NuPage 4–12% gradient gels ( LifeTechnology ) and transferred to PVDF membrane ( GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and stained with primary antibody overnight at +4°C , followed by a wash and staining with secondary HRP-conjugated antibody for 1 hr at room temperature . All antibodies used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . Total RNA was isolated from cells by using a Qiagen RNeasy kit and then reverse transcribed to generate cDNA with the High Capacity cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Quantitative PCR was performed by using SYBR green ( Quanta Biosciences ) in an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus instrument . Results were normalized to SETDB1 , a control mRNA found to not change expression from resting B cells through EBV-immortalization ( Price et al . , 2012 ) or GNB2LI ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . Cells were treated with various concentrations of ABT-199 ( ChemieTek , CT-A199 ) , ABT-737 ( Selleckchem , S1002 ) , flavopiridol ( Sigma , F3055 ) , or A1210477 ( Selleckchem , S7790 ) . All drugs were resuspended in DMSO . Cells were stained with fluorescent conjugates of Annexin-V ( eBioscience , 88-8007-72; RRID:AB_2575165 ) or incubated with CellEvent Caspase 3/7 Green Detection Reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific , C10423 ) . Cell death is reported as a percentage of Annexin-V positive or caspase 3/7-positive of total events . Survival is plotted as the percentage of CD19+ , proliferating B cells normalized by input volume using the FACS Canto II high-throughput 96-well sampler to DMSO-treated control cells . Protein stability was assayed by incubating LCLs in 15 µM cycloheximide ( Sigma , C1988 ) . Time points were taken immediately before addition ( 0 min ) , and then at 30 , 60 , and 120 min after addition of cycloheximide and analyzed by western blot loading 10 µg of protein per lane . Mitochondria isolation was performed using a mitochondria isolation kit ( Thermo Scientific ) on 50 million cells . Cells were lysed with Reagents A , B , and C as supplied by the manufacturer’s kit . Mitochondrial pellets were lysed in 0 . 1% Triton lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors . Total , cytoplasmic , and mitochondrial fractions were measured by Bradford assay and 5 μg protein was loaded per lane . The ability to capture nascently transcribed RNA was modified from previously described work ( Payne et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , cells were treated with 200 µM 4-thiouridine ( 4sU ) for one hour before total RNA was harvested in 1 mL of TRIzol ( Life Technologies ) . Nascently transcribed RNA over this time period incorporated 4sU , which was subsequently biotinylated and pulled down using streptavidin MyOne C1 Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) . RNA was reverse transcribed and qPCR was performed as described above . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) was performed as described previously ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) using a Millipore ChIP assay kit ( 17-295 ) and sonicated with a standard Diagenode Bioruptor sonicator . All antibodies used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . Chromatin Conformation Capture ( CCC ) was performed as described previously ( Hagège et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , chromatin was crosslinked with formaldehyde and isolated from LCLs , whereupon it was digested overnight with the restriction enzyme HindIII . Digested chromatin was then diluted and ligated overnight . Reversal of crosslinks , proteinase K digestion , and phenol-chloroform extraction yielded DNA circles that were assayed by TaqMan qPCR . All oligos and probes used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . pCEP-EBNA3A , an episomal expression vector , was introduced into LCLs using the MicroPorator MP-100 ( Digital Bio ) . Cells were incubated with DNA and shocked at 1300V for 1 pulse of 30 ms and then recovered in 15% FBS containing RPMI . Cells were co-transfected with an additional pCEP-TdTomato plasmid to mark transfected cells with red fluorescence . Student’s 2-way ANOVA and two-tailed t-test were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 software . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , and ***p<0 . 001 were considered significant . IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad and 95% confidence intervals were reported .\n",

Like other closely related viruses , such as those that cause chicken pox and cold sores , an infection lasts for the rest of the person’s life , although the virus generally remains in a latent or dormant state . However , under certain conditions the latent viruses can cause cancers to develop; in fact , it is estimated that such infections are responsible for nearly 2% of all cancer deaths worldwide . One way that healthy human cells prevent cancer is by triggering their own death in a process called apoptosis . The Epstein-Barr virus can block apoptosis , therefore making the cells more likely to become cancerous . Previous research identified one protein in the Epstein-Barr virus that promotes cancer by preventing infected cells from dying as normal . However , even in the absence of this protein , Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells remain resistant to apoptosis . This suggests that the virus has another way of blocking cell death . Price et al . have now used a technique that stresses living cells in a way that reveals which proteins prevent apoptosis to study human cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus . This revealed that soon after infection , the virus could force the human cell to produce MCL-1 , a protein that prevents cell death . Later , the Epstein-Barr virus enlisted a second human protein called BFL-1 , which makes the infected cell further resistant to apoptosis . Price et al . discovered that a protein in the Epstein-Barr virus called EBNA3A controls the production of the MCL-1 and BFL-1 proteins . In the future , developing therapies that target these proteins may lead to new treatments for cancers caused by the Epstein-Barr virus . Such treatments would be likely to have fewer side effects for patients than traditional chemotherapies .\"\n",

            "Summary =\n",
            "  The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widespread human tumor virus that causes various cancers, including lymphomas and carcinomas. EBV expresses viral oncoproteins that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis, a programmed cell death process. One such oncoprotein, LMP1, constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for the survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection, EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. Researchers have sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection. They used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and found that EBV infection modestly reduces overall mitochondrial priming but changes BCL-2 family dependencies between uninfected and infected cells. Specifically, uninfected B cells rely on BCL-2 or BCL-w for survival, while EBV-infected proliferating B cells rely on both MCL-1, to block Bad-induced depolarization, and BCL-2/BCL-w, to block Noxa-induced depolarization. LCLs lose sensitivity to Bmf but remain sensitive to Puma, suggesting additional BFL-1 mediated pro-survival effects. The researchers also found that EBV infection reduces the dependence of B cells on BCL-2, BCL-xL, or BCL-w for survival, and that EBV-infected B cells are less primed for apoptosis due to the combined protective effects of MCL-1 and BCL-2 during early proliferation with additional protection afforded by BFL-1 in immortalized B cells. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay between EBV infection and BCL-2 family dependencies, which has implications for EBV lymphomagenesis and potential therapeutic strategies.\n"
