Lung-resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs) play a crucial role in maintaining lung health and regenerating lung tissue after injury. They are found in the alveolar niche and can interact with other cells to promote growth, differentiation, and self-renewal. When the body is infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common and burdensome virus, these LR-MSCs become activated and play a role in the immune response.Researchers studied the function of LR-MSCs during RSV infection using primary pediatric LR-MSCs and a model of human RSV infection in lambs. They found that RSV infection of LR-MSCs leads to a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory response, including the release of cytokines that can modulate T cell function. This response is similar to the response of airway epithelial cells (AECs), another target of RSV, to the virus.In addition to their role in the immune response, LR-MSCs may also be a target of RSV infection in vivo. In a study of neonatal lambs infected with RSV, RSV antigen was found in pneumocytes and viral RNA was detected in both the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) tissues. The virus was also detected in lung-derived MSC cultures and BAL-derived MSCs from infected animals.In summary, LR-MSCs play a role in the immune response to RSV infection and may also be a target of the virus. Further research is needed to understand the full extent of their involvement in RSV infection and their potential as a target for treatment.
Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), a parasitic disease, is endemic in South Sudan and can cause severe complications for pregnant women. A study was conducted to describe the characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with VL in South Sudan. The study included 113 pregnant women with VL and 223 non-pregnant women with VL for comparison. The results showed that pregnant women with VL had more severe anemia, were more likely to need blood transfusions, and were more often prescribed antibiotics compared to non-pregnant women with VL. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage and premature delivery, were also more common in pregnant women with VL. The study suggests that good maternal survival rates are possible in resource-limited settings, despite the high incidence of complications. This is the largest cohort of VL in pregnancy described in the literature.
"Salmonella Typhi, a bacterium that causes typhoid fever, is a significant public health concern worldwide. A study was conducted in Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, to understand the evolutionary history of Salmonella Typhi strains causing invasive disease in the region over a 12-year period. Blood samples were collected from individuals presenting with severe acute respiratory illness or acute febrile illness, and the bacteria were identified using standard microbiology procedures. The bacteria were then preserved in ultra-low freezers. Genomic DNA of the 412 Salmonella isolates was used to create genomic libraries, which were paired-end sequenced using Illumina platforms.The study found that of the 412 Salmonella isolates, 327 were identified as Salmonella Typhi. Of these, 17 were dropped due to the presence of secondary genera or serotype or did not meet the required quality indicator threshold. The remaining 310 isolates were determined to have adequate sequence quality for further analyses. By whole genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST), 4 different genetic clades were identified. The predominant clade captured most isolates detected from 2007 to 2019 (n = 290; 93.4%). Isolates in the predominant clade differed from each other by a median of 14 alleles (range: 0--52). All MDR isolates belonged to this clade and were genotype 4.3.1 which could be further segregated into 4.3.1.1 (n = 254, 81.9%) and 4.3.1.2 (n = 36, 11.6%). All 4.3.1.1 genomes belonged to the East Africa 1 sub-lineage, while 4.3.1.2 could be further sub-divided into EA2 (n = 24) and EA3 (n = 12). Isolates in the remaining 3 clades comprised of antimicrobial-susceptible isolates detected from 2007--2014 belonging to genotypes 2.2.2 (n = 2, 0.6%); 2.5 (n = 6, 1.9%); and 3.3.1 (n = 12, 3.9%). The other non-4.3.1 genotypes did not contain resistance markers or plasmids. Resistance determinants such as aph (3"")-Ib and aph (6) -Id (confer aminoglycoside resistance), blaTEM-1 (confer β-lactam resistance), catA1 (confer chloramphenicol resistance), dfrA7 (confer trimethoprim resistance), sul1 and sul2 (confer sulphonamide resistance), and tet (B) (tetracycline resistance) were identified in the isolates. The prevalence of MDR genes was similar in earlier years where the number of S. Typhi identified was high (2007--2012: 203 isolates, 76.3%) and later years where S. Typhi levels were low (2013--2019: 32 isolates, 72.7%; Fishers Exact Test: P = 0.5478). Additionally, point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of gyrA or gyrB were detected in 62 (20.0%) isolates. These mutations can lead to resistance to quinolone-based antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.Overall, the study provides important insights into the evolutionary history and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella Typhi in Kibera. Understanding the genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella Typhi in different geographical locations can inform public health interventions and guide the selection of effective antibiotics for patient management."
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the vulnerability of humanity to novel coronaviruses. While vaccines are available, they have not been administered widely enough to prevent the virus from mutating and evading the immune response. Researchers have been looking for antibodies that can neutralize not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other coronaviruses that may cause disease in the future.In this study, the researchers identified a group of human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that target the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This domain is highly conserved among coronaviruses, meaning that hmAbs that bind to it are more likely to be effective against a range of coronaviruses. The hmAb 1249A8 emerged as the most potent and broad, able to recognize all human β-coronaviruses and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It was also effective at protecting mice and hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection.These results suggest that hmAbs that target the S2 domain of the spike protein have the potential to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 through both neutralization and Fc-dependent effector functions. The hmAb 1249A8 in particular has potent neutralizing activity and can bind to a range of coronaviruses, making it a promising candidate for a universal coronavirus vaccine. Additionally, the hmAb 1213H7, which targets the S1 domain of the spike protein, had the greatest ADCP activity and can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2. When the two hmAbs were combined and delivered directly to the respiratory tract, they significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in mice.In summary, this study has identified a group of hmAbs that can neutralize a range of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and have the potential to be developed into a universal coronavirus vaccine. The hmAb 1249A8, in particular, is a promising candidate for further study and development.
Lay Summary:Candida parapsilosis is a type of yeast that can break down certain compounds derived from benzene and benzoic acid, using the 3-oxoadipate (3-OAP) and gentisate pathways. These pathways are controlled by gene clusters that include enzymes, transporters, and transcription factors. The researchers determined the complete genome sequence of a particular strain of C. parapsilosis and used it to study the activation of the 3-OAP and gentisate pathways. They found that when the yeast assimilates different hydroxyaromatic compounds, specific genes and proteins related to these pathways are activated. The researchers also identified two new proteins that may be involved in the metabolism of hydroxyaromatic substrates. Additionally, they found that the activation of these pathways is associated with the upregulation of genes involved in other metabolic processes, such as fatty acid metabolism, glyoxylate cycle, and amino acid metabolism. The study provides new insights into the regulation and coordination of these pathways with central metabolism and organelle biogenesis in C. parapsilosis.
"The text discusses a method called ""oracle-supervised Neural Engineering Framework"" (osNEF) used to train biologically-detailed spiking neural networks to perform cognitive tasks. The networks are trained using an ""oracle"", a parallel network that supervises the learning process. The osNEF method can be used with different types of neuron models and synaptic models, and it is shown that the performance is comparable across all systems and neuron models, with variance proportional to task and neuron model complexity. The osNEF method is then applied to build a model of working memory that performs a delayed response task using a combination of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons connected with NMDA and GABA synapses. The model's baseline performance and forgetting rate are consistent with animal data from delayed match-to-sample tasks. The authors suggest that osNEF can train functional brain models using biologically-detailed components and open new avenues for investigating the relationship between biophysical mechanisms and functional capabilities."
Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), resulting in a genome-wide transcriptomic deregulation that impacts different tissues and cell types. A meta-analysis of all publicly available transcriptomic datasets, both human and mouse, was conducted to better understand the genome-wide deregulation caused by trisomy 21. The analysis revealed that the deregulation is not random but involves specific molecular cascades where both HSA21 genes and HSA21 interactors are more consistently deregulated. These deregulations occur in clusters, with groups of 2 to 13 genes found consistently deregulated. The most consistent changes are enriched in interferon-related categories and neutrophil activation, supporting the concept that DS is an inflammatory disease. The impact of the trisomy may differ in each tissue due to the different gene set deregulation, despite the triplicated genes being the same. The analysis confirmed the importance of known genes, such as SOD1, and detected new ones that could be useful for generating or confirming hypotheses and supporting new putative therapeutic candidates. A user-friendly web application was created to query Ensembl gene IDs and retrieve all the information of their differential expression across the datasets. The study highlights the importance of transcriptomic data integration in understanding complex disorders like DS, and the potential of this approach for other disorders such as cancer.
Brain activity can be recorded and analyzed through various imaging techniques such as EEG, MEG, and iEEG. These techniques capture the electrical activity of the brain. Neural oscillations, a type of brain activity, can be understood as waves. These waves have three basic properties: amplitude, frequency, and phase. Amplitude describes the height of a wave's peaks and the depth of its troughs, frequency defines how many waves occur per second, and the phase of a wave changes from 0° to 360° between two consecutive peaks of that wave and then repeats, similar to the phases of the moon. Previous studies have shown that brain activity at different frequencies can interact. For instance, neural firing (when nerve impulses are sent from one neuron to the next) is related to ‘high frequency activity’; and the amplitude of high frequency activity can be altered by the phase of other, lower frequency brain activity. This phenomenon is called ‘phase-amplitude coupling’ and it has been demonstrated in rodents but is largely untested in humans.A study by Watrous et al. explored this hypothesis in epilepsy patients who had ECoG electrodes implanted in their brains for a diagnostic procedure before surgery. These electrodes were used to record brain activity while the patients viewed images from four different categories (houses, scenes, tools, and faces). Watrous et al. found that phase-amplitude coupling occurred in over 40% of the recordings of brain activity. The analysis also revealed that the phase of the lower frequency activity at which the high frequency activity occurred was different for each of the four image categories. This provides support for the phase-coding hypothesis in humans, suggesting that not only how much neural firing occurs but also when (or specifically at what phase) it occurs is important for how the brain represents information. Future studies could now build on this analysis to see if phase-amplitude coupling also supports phase coding and neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.Neural oscillations, or brain waves, can also be understood as ongoing oscillations and evoked responses. Although typically studied separately, they might in fact be closely related. One possibility is that neuronal oscillations have non-zero mean which predicts that stimulus- or task-triggered amplitude modulation of oscillations can contribute to the generation of evoked responses. A study used computational modelling and analysis of a large EEG data set to validate this mechanism. With a biophysical model, they demonstrated that intracellular currents in the neuron are asymmetric and, consequently, the mean of alpha oscillations is non-zero. To understand the effect that neuronal currents exert on oscillatory mean, they varied several biophysical and morphological properties of neurons in the network. For a very large range of model parameters, they observed evidence for non-zero mean of oscillations. Complimentary, they analyzed empirical rest EEG recordings of 90 participants and, with spatio-spectral decomposition, detected at least one spatially-filtered oscillatory component of non-zero mean alpha oscillations in 93% of participants. This provides further support for the idea that amplitude modulation of neural oscillations should at least partially explain the generation of evoked responses. Therefore, inference about changes in evoked responses with respect to cognitive conditions, age, or neuropathologies should be constructed while taking into account oscillatory neuronal dynamics.In conclusion, neural oscillations are a main form of neuronal activity in the human brain and they have been implicated in diverse sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. Another prominent form of neuronal activity is evoked responses (evoked potentials, evoked fields) which are transient phase-locked events produced by stimuli, movement, and cognitive operations. These two phenomena are usually studied separately but there are two general ways through which they can be interrelated. On the one hand, ongoing neuronal oscillations can modulate evoked responses. These modulations are probably due to the fact that neuronal oscillations, such as alpha and beta rhythms, are associated with changes in cortical excitability which in turn affect the recruitment of neurons responding to stimuli. On the other hand, evoked responses may, in fact, reflect changes in certain aspects of neuronal oscillations from which it would follow that both phenomena may be closely linked and share a neurophysiological origin.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus that can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with a high fatality rate. Although discovered over 70 years ago, our understanding of its pathogenesis remains limited. A recent study used RNA-Seq to examine kinetic changes in host expression and viral replication in two human liver cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) infected with CCHFV. The study identified numerous host pathways modulated by the virus, including the antiviral response and endothelial cell leakage. The genes encoding DDX60, a cytosolic component of the RIG-I signalling pathway, and OAS2 were both shown to be dysregulated. PTPRR was induced in Huh7 cells but not HepG2 cells, which has been associated with the TLR9 signalling cascade and poor outcomes in patients. Whole-genome sequencing of CCHFV revealed its diversity over time and its relationship to the host response, demonstrating a proof-of-principle that CCHFV specimens can be analyzed to identify both the virus and host biomarkers that may have implications for prognosis. This study highlights the potential of using next-generation mRNA deep-sequencing to examine mRNA gene expression and viral evolution, and the importance of understanding the host response in liver cells to provide insight into CCHFV pathogenesis.
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects perception and cognitive behavior, including working memory (WM) deficits. WM is a crucial function that temporally stores and manipulates information to guide appropriate behavior. It has been linked with various cognitive domains, including perception, attention, problem-solving, and executive control. WM deficits in schizophrenia have been widely documented and attributed to decreased capacity. However, recent research suggests that other components, such as precision, also mediate behavioral performance.A study measured the performance of 60 schizophrenia patients and 61 healthy control subjects in a classical delay-estimation visual working memory task. They evaluated several computational models to disentangle the effect of various memory components. The results showed that the variable precision (VP) model was the best model to explain the performance of both groups. Schizophrenia patients exhibited abnormally larger variability of allocating memory resources rather than resources or capacity per se. Individual differences in the resource allocation variability predicted variation of symptom severity in schizophrenia patients, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenic pathology.These findings provide an alternative view instead of the widely accepted decreased-capacity theory and highlight the key role of elevated resource allocation variability in generating atypical VWM behavior in schizophrenia. The study also sheds new light on the utility of Bayesian observer models to characterize mechanisms of mental deficits in clinical neuroscience.In summary, a lay summary of the text is that schizophrenia patients have working memory deficits, which have been widely attributed to decreased capacity. However, recent research suggests that other components, such as precision, also mediate behavioral performance. A study found that schizophrenia patients exhibited abnormally larger variability of allocating memory resources rather than resources or capacity per se. Individual differences in the resource allocation variability predicted variation of symptom severity in schizophrenia patients, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenic pathology. The findings provide an alternative view instead of the widely accepted decreased-capacity theory and highlight the key role of elevated resource allocation variability in generating atypical VWM behavior in schizophrenia.
This text is about a study on the HIV-1 virus and its envelope glycoprotein (Env), which plays a crucial role in the virus' entry into host cells by binding to specific receptors and undergoing conformational changes. The focus of the study is on the gp41 subunit of Env, which is less well-understood than the gp120 subunit. The researchers identified an HIV-1 Env variant with a specific change (Q563R) in the gp41 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region that significantly increases viral infectivity when exposed to autologous or heterologous HIV-positive plasma, but reduces infectivity in their absence. This phenotype was found to be disrupting the formation of the gp41 six-helix bundle required for virus-cell membrane fusion. Antibodies that bind cluster I epitopes on gp41 can restore the infectivity of this variant. The Q563R change also increases HIV-1 sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER). Overall, the study sheds light on the role of gp41 residues and host antibodies in membrane fusion and viral infectivity, and informs about a potential mechanism to alleviate a viral defect through host factors.
The COnsensus Molecular SUbtype of Cancer (COMSUC) web server is a new tool that allows users to explore consensus molecular subtypes of over 30 cancers using eight clustering methods and five types of omics data. Users can use public reference datasets or upload their own private data. The web server provides interactive and modifiable visualization, and publishable output of analysis results. It is publicly and freely available with no login requirement. The server integrates discrepant clustering results from multi-methods and multi-omics data to identify consensus molecular subtypes of cancers. This can help researchers in identifying cancer subtypes and understanding the relationships between different subtypes. Future studies can build on this analysis to see if consensus clustering also supports neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.
Ticks are blood-feeding organisms that are widely distributed and can adapt to various environments and host animals. They can carry many types of viruses, some of which can cause diseases in humans and animals. The seabird tick, Ixodes uriae, is one such tick that is found in both northern and southern circumpolar regions. In this study, researchers analyzed the viruses found in Ix. uriae ticks from Antarctica and Sweden. They identified 16 RNA viruses, seven of which were new. Some of the viruses they found had been identified before in Ix. uriae ticks and some can cause illness in birds and/or humans.The researchers found that most of the viruses were specific to either the northern or southern hemisphere and were not found in ticks from the other region. However, they did find two variants of Ronne virus and one novel bunyavirus, Bonden virus, in both the northern and southern hemispheres. This suggests that there have been relatively recent and historical dispersal events of viruses between the two polar regions. The researchers also found that there has been widespread geographical dispersal of viruses within each hemisphere.The researchers analyzed the mitochondrial genome of Ix. uriae and found that the southern circumpolar population of ticks had greater genetic diversity than the northern population. This suggests that the southern population may represent the ancestral population. The phylogenetic analysis of a subset of closely related bunyaviruses revealed several patterns of geographic dispersal and suggested that Ix. uriae-associated viruses are being transported by migratory birds within and between the circumpolar regions.Overall, this study provides new insights into the viruses carried by Ix. uriae ticks and their dispersal within and between the circumpolar regions. Further research is needed to better understand virus-tick co-evolution and the potential public health implications of these findings.
RecombineX is a new computational tool designed for automated, high-throughput analysis of tetrads, which are groups of four cells produced by meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms. It is a Linux-based framework that can be installed and configured automatically, and includes a series of modules for different stages of the data analysis workflow. These modules include genome and read preparation, parental marker identification, gamete read mapping and genotyping, and tetrad-based recombination event profiling. RecombineX can be used in two modes: reference-based mode, which requires a reference genome assembly and the short reads of the two crossing parents, and parent-based mode, which requires the native genome assemblies of both crossing parents. Both modes require short reads of individual gametes, ideally labeled based on their original tetrad contexts. RecombineX identifies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between the two parental backgrounds and uses high-confident SNVs as polymorphic markers segregated between the two parental backgrounds. It then computes the best supported genotype at each marker position for each gamete and identifies and classifies recombination events into different categories. RecombineX can also identify post-meiotic segregation (PMS) of unrepaired heteroduplex DNA formed during recombination. It can generate detailed reports on genomic coordinates, marker supports, genotype segregation patterns, and the associated linkage blocks for downstream analysis. RecombineX can be used to analyze recombination events in their native parental genome contexts, and can identify accurate and robust parental markers, which is a prerequisite for high-quality tetrad analysis. It includes multiple filters to effectively cull out markers falling in repetitive and CNV regions. RecombineX has been tested using simulated and real data, and has been shown to be accurate and powerful in multiple application scenarios. It is an all-around one stop solution for future tetrad analyses.
White blood cells, specifically T cells, have proteins called APOBEC3 (A3) that can block certain viruses, like HIV-1, by introducing mutations into their genetic material. There are seven types of A3 proteins in humans, each with different levels of antiviral activity. The most potent one is A3G, but other combinations of A3 domains may also be effective. Researchers created synthetic combinations of A3C and A3H domains and found that they had enhanced antiviral activity similar to or even better than A3G. This increased activity was due to both cytidine-deaminase dependent and independent mechanisms, with a stronger affinity for binding RNA. These findings suggest that novel combinations of A3 domains can be created to have potent antiviral activity against HIV-1, which could potentially be used to develop new treatments for HIV.
This text is about a new method for studying the evolution of tumors using genetic data. Tumors are made up of many different cells, and these cells can change and evolve over time. This can make it hard to study the evolution of tumors, because it is difficult to get genetic data from many different cells at different times. This new method, called TumE, uses a type of artificial intelligence called a Bayesian neural network to analyze genetic data from tumor biopsies. TumE can help researchers understand how tumors evolve and adapt, which could lead to better ways to diagnose and treat cancer. The method was tested on synthetic data, or data that was created using computer simulations, and on data from real tumors. TumE was able to accurately classify and quantify the evolutionary and subclonal dynamics in the tumors, which means it can provide useful information about the number and type of cells in a tumor, as well as how they are changing and evolving. This could help doctors make more informed treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.
Trypanosomes are parasites that cause significant diseases in both humans and animals in Africa. These parasites are transmitted mainly by tsetse flies, and they are responsible for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT). HAT, also known as sleeping sickness, can lead to severe neurological symptoms and death if left untreated. AAT, also known as Nagana, causes significant production losses and reduces the wealth of livestock farmers.A study was conducted in two active HAT foci in Southern Chad, Mandoul and Maro, to investigate the circulating trypanosomes, including the occurrence of potentially zoonotic species in humans and livestock, and in their biological vector, the tsetse fly. The study aimed to contribute to the monitoring strategies by providing the genetic diversity of circulating trypanosomes, which is essential in achieving the goal of diseases elimination.The study found that in Mandoul, an area with ongoing HAT surveillance and tsetse control operations, the trypanosome species identified in humans and cattle were T. b. gambiense, T. congolense, T. vivax, and T. theileri. In contrast, in Maro, an area without similar activities, the trypanosome species identified in humans and cattle were T. b. gambiense, T. congolense, T. vivax, T. theileri, T. godfreyi, T. simiae, and T. grayi. Additionally, evidence for additional unknown trypanosomes was obtained in tsetse flies in Maro. The study also found that T. theileri, T. vivax, and T. simiae were frequent in cattle in Mandoul, suggesting transmission by other insect vectors.The study highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling HAT and AAT, as active HAT infections stress the need to enforce monitoring and control campaigns. The diverse trypanosome species in humans and cattle indicate the necessity to investigate the infectivity of the unknown trypanosomes regarding their zoonotic potential. The study suggests that the study should be widened to other trypanosome hosts to capture the whole diversity of circulating trypanosomes.In summary, the study found that there is a high diversity and frequency of trypanosomes in Mandoul and Maro, including HAT/AAT pathogenic species. The study emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring and control campaigns to achieve the goal of diseases elimination and the importance of investigating the infectivity of unknown trypanosomes regarding their zoonotic potential.
Schistosoma is a type of parasitic flatworm that can infect humans and animals, and it can cause diseases like schistosomiasis. There are different species of Schistosoma, including S. haematobium and S. bovis, which can infect different types of animals and can sometimes interbreed. A team of researchers conducted a study to examine the genetic relationships between these Schistosoma species and their hybrids.The researchers analyzed the genomes of 19 Schistosoma isolates, including 11 that were classified as S. haematobium, 6 as S. bovis, and 2 as hybrids of the two species. They used a whole genome sequencing approach to develop single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that allowed them to differentiate between the two species and their hybrids.The results showed that all the isolates from the S. haematobium cluster, except for one from Madagascar, had signatures of genomic introgression from S. bovis. This means that some DNA from S. bovis had been incorporated into the genomes of these S. haematobium isolates. The isolates from Corsica, Mali, and Egypt had a specific introgressed tract from S. bovis, which has been previously detected in some introgressed S. haematobium populations from Niger.These findings suggest that introgression from S. bovis is widespread across S. haematobium and that the observed introgression is unidirectional, meaning that DNA is flowing from S. bovis into S. haematobium but not the other way around. This has implications for the genetic integrity of S. haematobium and the potential for hybridization and introgression to affect the evolution and adaptation of these parasitic worms. Further studies are needed to fully understand the extent and impact of this genetic exchange between Schistosoma species.
The study explores the potential of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines, focusing on dimeric IgA (dIgA) in the form of secretory IgA. The researchers used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging and fluorescent microscopy to determine how dIgA antibodies influence virus interaction with mucosal barriers and viral penetration in colorectal tissue. The results showed that HIV virions rapidly disseminate throughout the colon two hours after exposure. The presence of dIgA resulted in an increase in virions and penetration depth in the transverse colon. Additionally, virions were found in the mesenteric lymph nodes two hours after viral exposure, and the presence of dIgA led to an increase in virions in mesenteric lymph nodes. These findings suggest that dIgA antibodies affect viral dissemination and penetration throughout the gut mucosa, potentially through the formation of immune complexes. The combined PET imaging and fluorescent microscopy methodology proved to be efficient for non-invasively tracking HIV and antibodies.

It is maintained on GitLab, where users can report bugs and request new features. Overall, Iliski is a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners who need to calculate TFs in order to understand the relationships between different signals.
The text is a qualitative evidence synthesis examining the values and preferences of pregnant women, mothers, families, and healthcare workers concerning infant feeding options when there are feeding difficulties due to Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) or similar conditions. CZS is a condition in infants caused by infection with the Zika virus during pregnancy, resulting in various physical and developmental consequences, including microcephaly, dysphagia, and an increased likelihood of choking. The synthesis includes six studies specific to CZS, all from Brazil, and eight additional studies reporting feeding difficulties in infants with severe disability and nonprogressive, chronic encephalopathies. The findings consistently reported that breast-feeding was the preference for all mothers in the studies, and the inability to do so affected bonding between parents and child and generated fear and anxiety relating to feeding choices, especially around the risks of choking and swallowing. Additionally, the perception was that health professionals were often unable to offer appropriate advice, suggesting the potential value of training. Furthermore, mothers strongly desired to achieve individual maternal autonomy in infant feeding decisions. Confidence in most findings ranged from low to moderate. Overall, the evidence base has limitations, but consistently reported that parents of children with feeding difficulties due to CZS or similar conditions need information, advice, and counselling, and substantial emotional support. These needs are often not recognized or satisfied, and optimal feeding and support strategies for this population have not yet been identified.
"White blood cells, specifically B cells, are crucial to our immune system as they produce antibodies to fight off pathogens. A research team has been studying the use of nanoparticles to present viral antigens, such as HIV, in a way that can improve the body's immune response. They used a technique called ""protein engineering"" to design nanoparticles with different sizes and shapes, and then attached HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) antigens to them. The Env antigens were based on two types of HIV strains and had stabilizing mutations to help induce a stronger immune response. The nanoparticles were then tested in rabbits, and it was found that they elicited similar antibody binding titers as compared to soluble proteins. However, the nanoparticle immunogen resulted in slightly elevated neutralizing antibody titers that were more focused on the trimer apex. The researchers concluded that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully used for presenting HIV Env trimer immunogens, but further research is needed to determine the optimal implementation in different immunization strategies. This research is important because recombinant protein immunogens have the potential to be effective vaccines against difficult viral and microbial targets, such as HIV and malaria."
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a harmful virus that can infect a variety of animals, including swine and humans. It has several ways to evade the immune system, one of which involves a protein called UL13. This protein inhibits the STING-mediated antiviral signaling pathway, which is crucial for the body's defense against viral infections. UL13 does this by interacting with the STING protein and promoting its degradation through the ubiquitination pathway. Specifically, UL13 recruits the E3 ligase RING-finger protein 5 (RNF5) to promote K27-/K29-linked ubiquitination and degradation of STING. This results in a decrease in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other antiviral factors. A study found that mice infected with a mutant PRV lacking UL13 had an enhanced antiviral immune response and reduced pathogenicity. This suggests that UL13 plays a role in PRV's ability to evade the host's immune response by targeting the STING-mediated signaling pathway.
Mosquitoes are carriers for various diseases, including Zika virus, which is transmitted to humans through their bites. The text discusses research on how different environmental factors, such as temperature, can affect the ability of mosquitoes to transmit Zika virus. The study found that mosquitoes exposed to fluctuating temperatures had a lower ability to transmit the virus than those exposed to constant temperatures. Additionally, the study found that the virus mutated more in mosquitoes exposed to fluctuating temperatures, which could have implications for the development of vaccines and other control measures. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between temperature fluctuations and mosquito-borne diseases.In simpler terms,Mosquitoes can carry and transmit diseases, such as Zika virus, to humans. The text discusses research on how different environmental factors, like temperature, can affect the ability of mosquitoes to transmit the virus. The study found that mosquitoes exposed to changing temperatures had a harder time transmitting the virus than those exposed to constant temperatures. The virus also mutated more in mosquitoes exposed to changing temperatures, which could make it harder to develop vaccines and other ways to control the spread of the disease. More research is needed to understand the relationship between temperature and mosquito-borne diseases.
Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is important for survival in many animals as it helps them detect food, mates, or predators. In the case of the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, it is attracted to certain odors and repelled by others. This study aimed to understand how the worm integrates conflicting olfactory signals to make behavioral decisions. The researchers found that when attractive and repulsive odors were presented together, the worms were repelled, and this effect was dependent on the concentration of the repellent. The researchers also identified genes and neural circuits involved in this process. Specifically, they found that the absence of genes osm-5, osm-1, and dyf-7 led to defects in olfactory integration. These genes are known to regulate the structure and function of sensory neurons. Additionally, the researchers found that the impaired cilia, which are sensory organelles, in the mutant animals may account for the reduced olfactory integration behavior. Overall, this study has identified genes and neural circuits involved in olfactory integration in C. elegans, which could help us understand how other animals, including humans, integrate conflicting olfactory signals.
Schistosomiasis, caused by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, affects millions of people worldwide and has a significant impact on public health. The current treatment relies solely on the drug praziquantel, which is facing the emergence of resistant strains. Vaccination could be a promising strategy for long-term control of the disease. A potential vaccine candidate is the extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from S. mansoni eggs. These EVs carry proteins that can stimulate an immune response and have shown protective effects against schistosomiasis in mice.In this study, S. mansoni egg-derived EVs were isolated and characterized. The EVs were rounded in shape and ranged in size from 50.5 to 172.2 nm. Immunization of mice with the EVs resulted in a significant reduction in adult worm load, hepatic and intestinal egg counts, and granuloma size compared to the control group. These results suggest that S. mansoni egg-derived EVs have the potential to be used as a vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis.Furthermore, the study identified the molecular weight of EVs’ protein components targeted by the antibody produced in vaccinated mice, which were found to be ~14 KDa and ~21 KDa. This indicates that EVs are able to stimulate specific antibodies response.In conclusion, the study highlights the potential of S. mansoni egg-derived EVs as a vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in different stages of the disease and in combination with other therapies.
"Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease that is relatively rare in Uganda, with an estimated 3,683 people living with the disease. However, there is a lack of data on mycetoma and its complications in the country due to underreporting and difficulties in diagnosing the disease. A study identified 279 cases of mycetoma in Uganda over 70 years, with a significant decline in cases in recent years. The study found that the disease was more prevalent in the 1960s to early 1980s, but it's unclear if this is due to a actual reduction in incidence or other factors.Mycetoma is caused by fungi or bacteria and affects the subcutaneous tissue, skin, muscles, and can spread to involve the bone. It is more common in males aged 11-40 years and is endemic in certain geographical locations known as the ""Mycetoma Belt."" The disease is usually introduced into the subcutaneous tissue by traumatic injury, and the foot is the most involved part of the body. Diagnosis of mycetoma is challenging, involving many differential diagnoses, and clinical diagnosis relies on the presence of multiple nodules and numerous sinuses discharging grains.The study identified fungi as the most common causative agents of mycetoma in Uganda, followed by Nocardia species and Actinomycetes. However, the biopsy reports did not identify the genus or species of the fungi. The spatial distribution of cases was almost even across the four regions, with most cases in the Kampala and Jinja districts. The study found that males and the age group of 21-30 were most affected by mycetoma, and the foot was the most affected part of the body.The study concluded that mycetoma is a rare disease in Uganda, with a big gap in data and epidemiological studies. There is a need for further studies, including active community-based case findings, to gain a better understanding of the burden of mycetoma in Uganda and improve diagnosis and treatment of the disease."
Simian malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, is a public health concern in Malaysia. While Malaysia has successfully eliminated human malaria transmission, simian malaria parasites like Plasmodium knowlesi, cynomolgi, inui, and fieldi are increasingly causing malaria in humans. These parasites are commonly found in macaques, which act as reservoirs. A systematic review of studies from 2000-2021 found that most simian malaria epidemiology studies were conducted in Peninsular Malaysia (71%) and all showed positive detection of Plasmodium parasites in macaques. The most prevalent Plasmodium species in macaques is P. inui (49.27%) and the least prevalent is P. fieldi (4.76%). The prevalence of simian malaria is higher in East Malaysia compared to Peninsular Malaysia. Macaques are the main reservoir of simian Plasmodium in Malaysia, and studying their epidemiology is crucial for public health management. The right measurements can be taken to prevent the transmission of simian malaria from macaques to humans.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a common virus that affects many people worldwide, and is associated with several cancers including lymphomas and epithelial tumors. EBNA1 is a protein that is consistently expressed in all EBV-associated malignancies and is important for viral DNA replication, maintenance, and controlling viral gene expression. However, the way EBV maintains latent infection at the post-translational level is not well understood.A new study has found that EBNA1 contains two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), SIM2 and SIM3, that are involved in EBNA1's functions. Mutation of SIM2 disrupts EBNA1 dimerization, while SIM3 contributes to the polySUMO2 modification of EBNA1. Proteomic and immunoprecipitation analyses reveal that the SIM3 motif is required for EBNA1-mediated inhibitory effects on SUMO2-modified STUB1, SUMO2-mediated degradation of USP7, and SUMO1-modified KAP1. Deletion of the EBNASIM motif leads to functional loss of both EBNA1-mediated viral episome maintenance and lytic gene silencing.Hypoxic stress induces the SUMO2 modification of EBNA1, and in turn the dissociation of EBNA1 with STUB1, KAP1 and USP7 to increase the SUMO1 modification of both STUB1 and KAP1 for reactivation of lytic replication. This suggests that the EBNA1SIM motif plays an essential role in EBV latency and is a potential therapeutic target against EBV-associated cancers.In summary, this study has found that EBNA1 contains two SIMs that are important for EBNA1's functions and EBV's ability to maintain latent infection. The SIM3 motif is involved in EBNA1-mediated inhibitory effects on SUMO2-modified proteins, and hypoxic stress induces the SUMO2 modification of EBNA1 leading to the reactivation of lytic replication. This information could be useful in the development of new therapies for EBV-associated cancers.
In this study, researchers aimed to improve the understanding of genes regulating grain yield in wheat, a vital staple crop. They focused on a specific region of chromosome 7AL, previously identified as affecting spikelet number per spike (SNS), grain number per spike (GNS), and grain yield. The researchers used genetic mapping and transgenic plants to establish that the A-genome homeolog of WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 (WAPO-A1) is the causal gene for this QTL. They found that WAPO-A1 affects SNS by regulating the timing of terminal spikelet formation, and that different haplotypes of WAPO-A1 are associated with varying SNS and GNS. The H2 haplotype, which is present in most modern common wheat varieties but rare in durum wheat, is associated with the strongest effects in increasing SNS and GNS. The researchers also observed wide-ranging floral abnormalities in both transgenic and mutant plants, indicating additional roles of WAPO1 on wheat floral development. These findings contribute to the development of more productive wheat varieties by improving the understanding of the genes regulating grain yield and providing a potential target for improving grain yield in both common and durum wheat.
Scrub typhus is an emerging disease caused by bacteria transmitted through the bites of infected chigger mites, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. However, recent cases in the Arabian Peninsula and Chile suggest a wider distribution. A study on Chiloé Island, Chile, found chigger mites on seven rodent species with a 55% prevalence rate. Of these, 15.8% of mite pools tested positive for Orientia DNA, all belonging to the genus Herpetacarus. These mites were also found in high infestation rates on three rodent species. This study suggests that chigger mites serve as vectors and reservoirs of scrub typhus in South America, with significant spatial variations in infestation rates.
During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean, dengue and chikungunya, two other viral diseases with the same mosquito vector, were also circulating. Due to similar symptoms, it is possible that many cases of Zika were misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa. This misdiagnosis can impact the interpretation of surveillance data used for epidemiological analyses. Researchers used principles of probability and estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to generate revised estimates of reported Zika cases, accounting for the accuracy of diagnoses based on clinical presentation with or without laboratory confirmation. They estimated that 944,700 (95% CrI: 884,900-996,400) Zika cases occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using molecular methods, and 608,400 (95% CrI: 442,000-821,800) cases when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using serological methods. The results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher reported cases of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil. The methodology has the potential to enhance the interpretation of passive surveillance data for these diseases and other co-circulating diseases with similarities in symptomatology and potential for misdiagnosis.
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that causes both acute and chronic infections, with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) affecting over 257 million people. HBV has an enveloped virion containing a partially double-stranded relaxed circular DNA genome. Upon infection, the viral genome is transported into the nucleus and forms an episomal cccDNA, which exists in a minichromosome form. HBV replicates its DNA genome via reverse transcription of a pregenomic (pg) RNA intermediate in hepatocytes. Interestingly, HBV RNA can be detected in virus-like particles in CHB patient serum and has been utilized as a biomarker for intrahepatic cccDNA activity in treated patients. However, the biogenesis and molecular characteristics of serum HBV RNA remain to be fully defined.A recent study investigated the molecular biology of serum HBV RNA in the HBV life cycle and its potential as a novel biomarker for CHB diagnosis and treatment prognosis. The study found that serum HBV RNA is secreted in noninfectious virion-like particle as spliced and poly (A)-free pgRNA. Specifically, the encapsidated serum HBV RNA predominately consists of pgRNA, which are detergent- and ribonuclease-resistant. These pgRNA-containing nonenveloped capsids and a minor population of pgRNA-containing virions are formed through both capsid assembly and viral envelope proteins, which can be inhibited by capsid assembly modulators and an envelope-knockout mutant, respectively. The pgRNA-virion utilizes the multivesicular body pathway for egress, similar to DNA-virion morphogenesis. Furthermore, serum/supernatant HBV pgRNA are mainly spliced and devoid of the 3’-terminal sequences. The study suggests that the molecular biology of serum HBV RNA in HBV life cycle can aid in the development of serum HBV RNA as a novel biomarker for CHB diagnosis and treatment prognosis.In summary, HBV RNA can be released in particles as VLPs and naked capsids prior to viral DNA synthesis, and the supernatant HBV RNA are associated with VLPs and naked capsids. HBV RNA-VLPs migrated at the DNA-virion position in particle gel, indicating that RNA-VLP contains HBV nucleocapsid. The secretion of RNA-VLPs needs envelopment, similar to DNA-containing virions, and is dependent upon the viral envelope proteins. The egress of RNA-virion requires the MVB secretory machinery, similar to HBV DNA-virion. The extracellular HBV RNA are detected as shorter species with heterogeneous lengths on Northern blot and are predominantly spliced pgRNA. The serum HBV RNA from CHB patient sera exhibited a different splicing pattern compared to that from HBV-transfected cells. The 3’ termini of the supernatant HBV RNA are mainly 3’ terminally truncated forms originated intracellularly. The mapped 3’ termini of the virion RNA possess further recessed 3’ termini compared to naked capsid RNA in cell cultures. The poly (A) tail might be missing from serum HBV RNA. Overall, this study sheds light on the molecular biology of serum HBV RNA in HBV life cycle and has potential implications for the development of serum HBV RNA as a novel biomarker for CHB diagnosis and treatment prognosis.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health concern, worsened by the emergence of drug-resistant TB. The bacterium causing TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), has a GC-rich genome, making it highly susceptible to certain mutations. Mtb has multiple DNA repair enzymes to maintain genomic integrity in its host environment. Researchers investigated the impact of deleting some of these DNA repair enzymes on the adaptation of the pathogen. They focused on uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs), which are crucial for repairing uracils in the DNA. The researchers generated mutants of uracil DNA glycosylases, either individually or together. They found that the double knockout mutant, RvΔdKO, had a higher spontaneous mutation rate, better survival rates in guinea pigs, and accumulated a larger number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when exposed to antibiotics. These findings suggest that compromised DNA repair leads to the accumulation of mutations, some of which may contribute to the adaptation of the pathogen in the host. This property could potentially be used to identify new drug targets for TB treatment.
"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the body's ""master clock,"" is made up of around 10,000 clock cells that vary in their circadian periods. These cells maintain coherence despite their differences, likely due to various cell-to-cell coupling mechanisms, including action potential (AP)-mediated connectivity. However, there is limited information about the morphology of these connections. To explore possible network features, researchers created a large pool of network morphologies and used multiple criteria to select appropriate models, including phase dispersal, phase-resetting ability, and perturbation decay rate. Successful models shared certain features, such as a positive correlation between ""indegree"" and ""outdegree,"" more connections in the ventrolateral region than the dorsal medial region, and a higher number of intra-core edges. These findings provide a useful guide for future explorations of the AP-mediated clock cell connectome within the SCN.In addition to local diffusive coupling, the SCN clock cells also use potentially far-reaching AP-mediated coupling. While the strength of diffusive coupling can be estimated, the strength of AP-mediated coupling is more challenging to determine. Researchers used an exhaustive scan of K values and network morphologies to find a suitable value of K and network morphologies that result in mathematical model systems that support circadian phase waves with properties similar to those observed in real SCN phase waves. The selected SCN model networks have several properties, including a positive correlation between ""indegree"" and ""outdegree,"" more intra-cell connections in the core than the shell, and dynamic properties consistent with the SCN having two well-modularized subregions. These findings will guide future experimental explorations of the AP-mediated clock cell network morphology within the SCN."
The text discusses a model called the Lexical Categorization Model (LCM), which explains the role of a specific part of the brain, the left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lvOT), in reading. The LCM assumes that the lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filtering out non-words. The LCM was found to predict lvOT activation better than alternative models in three functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. The LCM suggests that word recognition in the ventral visual stream involves word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization before one can access word meaning. The LCM was derived from a large set of orthographic strings, and it was found that word/non-word categorizations can be achieved with high certainty for stimuli with peaks at the extreme ends of the word-likeness distribution, but not for stimuli with intermediate word-likeness levels. The LCM is based on the concept of entropy, which measures how difficult it is to categorize a letter string correctly. The LCM was found to simulate published fMRI-based lvOT activation results better than alternative models and to outperform other models in predicting empirically measured BOLD activity in lvOT. Overall, the LCM provides a new understanding of the role of the lvOT in reading and word recognition.
The text discusses the role of the immune system and circadian rhythms in inflammation. Circadian rhythms, which are biological oscillations with a period of approximately 24 hours, have been found to have a significant influence on the immune system. Disruptions in these rhythms, such as those caused by shift work, can lead to inflammatory pathologies. The study uses a mathematical model to understand the mechanisms behind the weakened immune system in shift workers. The model includes the circadian clock and an acute inflammation model in male and female rats. The circadian clock is simulated to be phase advanced by 8 hours to represent shift work. The model predicts that the host is more sensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at certain times of the day due to changes in the levels of interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The model also predicts that the times of lowest and highest sensitivity to LPS are different for males and females, with males and females exhibiting an exaggerated response to LPS at certain times and a blunted response at other times. The model can be used to understand how shift work-mediated circadian disruptions affect the inflammatory and other physiological responses.
Dengue fever is a significant public health issue in Saudi Arabia, with the first case reported in 1993. The disease has since become endemic in the western and southern regions of the country, with Jeddah being the major contributor to the total number of cases. The economic burden of dengue fever (DF) in Saudi Arabia from 2013-2017 was estimated to be US$551 million, with an average cost of US$11,947.6 per patient. The total costs were highest in 2016, with over US$168.5 million, including direct (US$29 million) and indirect (US$139.5 million) costs for a total of 4415 confirmed cases. Productivity loss costs accounted for 63.3% to 83.8% of the estimated total costs. The study highlights the urgent need for an effective national prevention strategy to reduce the economic burden and morbidity of DF in Saudi Arabia.The economic burden of DF is substantial, with direct and indirect costs accounted for using a predictive model and human capital model, respectively. Direct costs were estimated to be US$13,214,717, while indirect costs were estimated to be US$21,915,358, resulting in total costs of US$35,129,775 per year. Remarkably, indirect costs were significantly higher than direct costs, with PYLS representing the major proportion of indirect costs. PYLS accounted for 63.3% to 83.8% of the estimated total costs, depending on the year. The study also assumed under-reporting, with an expansion factor of 3, resulting in an estimated yearly cost of dengue illness of US$110.73 million.The study's findings highlight the substantial economic burden of DF in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the need for effective prevention strategies. The high indirect costs suggest that not only the occurrence but also the timing of neural firing is essential for how the brain represents information. The study's findings provide valuable insights for policymakers to allocate resources, tailor specific prevention and control strategies, set priorities, and assess the cost-effectiveness of particular interventions. Future studies can build on this analysis to see if phase-amplitude coupling also supports phase coding and neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.In summary, the study found that dengue fever has a substantial local economic burden in Saudi Arabia, with an estimated total cost of US$551 million from 2013-2017. Direct and indirect costs were estimated using predictive and human capital models, respectively, with indirect costs being significantly higher than direct costs. The study also assumed under-reporting, resulting in an estimated yearly cost of dengue illness of US$110.73 million. The findings highlight the urgent need for effective prevention strategies to reduce the economic burden and morbidity of DF in Saudi Arabia.
Nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) are fat storage sites found inside the nuclei of cells. While they have been observed in some cells, their function is not well understood. They have been suggested to provide lipids for nuclear membrane growth, store proteins or unfolded hydrophobic proteins, and detoxify hydrophobic substances. However, it is unclear if they have any negative effects on the cell. A study in the worm C. elegans found that nLDs occur in the intestines and germ cells of the worm, but only seem to be harmful to intestinal cells. The worm's intestinal cells contain 30-34 nuclei that store fat and undergo endoreduplication, becoming much larger than other nuclei. During the self-fertile reproductive period of the worm's life, the intestines transfer fat and other metabolic resources to the gonad for egg production. The study found that nLDs occur in the intestinal nuclei of the worm, and are associated with complex changes in the nuclei during this reproductive period. These changes include the development of bundled microfilaments, the formation of a type I nucleoplasmic reticulum, and the generation of lamin-coated vesicles. Some intestinal nuclei appear to rupture at sites adjacent to large nLDs, and some nLDs appear to initiate a series of events that culminate in the formation of large nuclear cysts and the removal of aberrant nucleoplasm. These changes occur predominantly in a subset of adult intestinal cells that have the greatest fluctuation in stored fat during the self-fertile reproductive period. The study found that germ cell nuclei also form nLDs, but they do not appear to have the same negative effects as those in intestinal nuclei. The lack of similar defects in germ cells is likely due to structural differences in the two types of nuclei.
Bacterial meningitis, a serious inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, can lead to significant neurological damage. One major cause of bacterial meningitis is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and many survivors experience lasting neurological issues. However, the mechanisms by which pneumococci interact with and damage neurons are not well understood. In this study, researchers used human primary neurons and a bacteremia-derived meningitis mouse model to investigate the interaction between pneumococci and neurons. They found that pneumococci bind to the cytoskeleton protein β-actin through the pilus-1 adhesin RrgA and the cytotoxin pneumolysin (Ply), promoting adhesion and invasion of neurons and leading to neuronal death. This interaction is facilitated by the cholesterol-binding domain 4 of Ply, which interacts with the neuronal plasma membrane and increases the exposure of β-actin filaments, providing more binding sites for RrgA.The researchers also found that pneumococcal infection causes disruption of β-actin filaments in neurons, and that this neurotoxic effect can be inhibited using antibodies against β-actin. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms by which pneumococci cause neurological damage and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Further research is needed to understand the role of phase-amplitude coupling and phase coding in neuronal representation and to explore the potential of anti-β-actin antibodies in preventing neuronal damage caused by pneumococcal infection.
In this study, scientists used fighting fish (Betta splendens) to understand how fighting behavior is controlled at the physiological level. They observed that fighting in these fish proceeds in a specific order: first surface-breathing, then biting/striking, and finally mouth-locking. The frequency, duration, and distribution of mouth-locking determined the fight structure, and each fighting pair showed a unique pattern. The researchers also analyzed the brain transcriptome of the fish during fighting. They found that paired fish in the D60 group (fish that fought for 60 minutes) were closely clustered together, indicating a specific brain-transcriptomic state. A total of 1,082 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with a greater number of up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes in both fighting groups. Among these DEGs, 564 genes were specifically expressed in the D60 group, 223 genes were specifically expressed in the D20 group, and 295 genes were expressed in both the D20 and the D60 groups.The researchers also discovered brain-transcriptomic synchronization, meaning that the correlation coefficients of expressed gene transcripts between paired fish were significantly higher than those for unpaired fish in both the D20 and D60 groups, especially for the D60 group. This suggests that the brain-transcriptomic state of the two opponents in a pair were mutually influenced during fighting, and this synchronization became stronger in the D60 group.In conclusion, this study found that fighting in fish proceeds in a specific order, and the brain-transcriptomic state of the fish changes during fighting, with specific genes being up-regulated or down-regulated. The researchers also discovered brain-transcriptomic synchronization, which suggests that the brain-transcriptomic state of the two opponents in a pair are mutually influenced during fighting, becoming synchronized in a pair-specific manner. This synchronization was weaker in the D20 group but became stronger in the D60 group. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying social interactions and aggression.
The text discusses the discovery and analysis of a new strain of a virus named OmRV-LZ, which is a type of totivirus. Totiviruses have a non-segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome and are typically found in fungi or protozoan parasites. However, this new strain of OmRV has some unusual features, such as the presence of a pentamer protrusion at the five-fold vertex of the capsid. This protrusion is composed of a small protein cleaved from the polypeptide precursor encoded by ORF1. The protrusion may be associated with the extracellular transmission of the virus. The text also discusses the use of next-generation sequencing and de novo contig assembly to determine the genome sequence of the virus, which is 7613 nucleotides long and has a high degree of homology with other strains of OmRV. The text also discusses the use of cryo-electron microscopy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the virus and its protrusion. The results showed that the protrusion has a diameter of 540 Å, which is larger than the diameter of the virus without the protrusion (450 Å). The protrusion is located near pores on the virus surface, which may suggest a role in cell recognition or binding. The text also discusses the potential use of the virus in medical research, such as developing antibodies to study the virus and its interactions with host cells.
Ric-8B is a protein that interacts with certain types of G proteins and can act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. It is widely expressed in the brain and olfactory neurons, where it plays a role in odorant and dopamine receptor signaling. It also helps regulate G protein abundance and promote G protein complex formation. In embryos, Ric-8B is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and is essential for embryonic development. Embryos with reduced levels of Ric-8B have neural tube defects and die during embryogenesis. A study found that mTOR signaling, which is involved in cell growth and metabolism, is impaired in Ric-8B mutant embryos. Specifically, mTORC2 activity is downregulated, while mTORC1 activity remains unchanged. This reduction in mTORC2 activity leads to decreased phosphorylation of Akt, a pro-survival kinase, and increased transcription of pro-apoptotic genes. The study also found that signaling pathways involved in actin regulation are affected in Ric-8B mutant embryos. Overall, the study suggests that Ric-8B is required for normal mTORC2 activity during mouse embryogenesis and that its reduction leads to impaired mTORC2 signaling and increased apoptosis.
Dengue fever is a common vector-borne disease that affects millions of people each year, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. The disease is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The intensity of dengue fever outbreaks varies significantly among different seasons, with the weekly number of newly infected cases ranging from as low as 10 to 8,000 at peak week. There are generally no cases or only sporadic cases of dengue fever outside the outbreak season. The time series of dengue incidence usually present many zeros and are following zero-inflated distributions, which impose great challenges in accurate dengue predictions.A forecast system for dengue fever has been proposed that addresses the difficulty of predicting outbreaks with drastically different scales. The ensemble forecast system is based on a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type of compartmental model coupled with a data assimilation method called the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (EAKF) to generate real-time forecasts of dengue fever spread dynamics. The model was informed by meteorological and mosquito density information to depict the transmission of dengue virus among human and mosquito populations and generate predictions. To account for the dramatic variations of outbreak size in different seasons, the effective population size parameter was introduced into the model and updated using the most recent observations and historical records so that the predicted outbreak size is dynamically adjusted. The proposed forecast model generates accurate projections of peak timing, peak intensity, and total incidence, outperforming a generalized additive model approach. The ensemble forecast system can be operated in real-time and inform control planning to reduce the burden of dengue fever.
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease that can cause damage to the skin and peripheral nerves, leading to impairments if diagnosed late. The disease, along with social myths, attitudes, cultural and religious beliefs, and fear, can lead to stigma and discrimination against persons affected. This, in turn, can result in anxiety disorders, depression, suicide attempts, mental distress, emotions such as fear and shame, low self-esteem, and reduced quality of life for not only the persons affected but also their family members. Although leprosy is curable, many persons affected and their family members experience long-term impacts on their psychosocial wellbeing. A study was conducted to develop and pilot an intervention to strengthen the resilience of individuals and families affected by leprosy-related discrimination. The intervention was a 10-week family-based program that included action learning, problem-solving, and a session about rights. The study found that the intervention was feasible and had the potential to improve resilience and quality of life. Participants, particularly, appreciated the social dimensions of the intervention. The study concludes that a large-scale efficacy trial is necessary to determine the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of the intervention.
"Shugoshin, a protein found in budding yeast, plays a crucial role in correct chromosome segregation during cell division. It does this by helping to correctly attach sister chromatids to the mitotic spindle, a structure that helps separate the chromatids during cell division. Shugoshin recruits other proteins, such as PP2A-Rts1 and condensin, to centromeres, the area where the chromatids attach to the spindle. A region of shugoshin called the Serine-Rich Motif (SRM) is essential for the interaction with condensin and is regulated by phosphorylation. Mps1, a kinase involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates shugoshin within the SRM to regulate the interaction with condensin and its localization to centromeres. This phosphorylation disrupts the shugoshin-condensin interaction. The SRM region of shugoshin is required for correct chromosome segregation and centromeric functions, and its deletion reduces the accumulation of condensin on centromeres. The Sgo1-condensin interactions are not dependent on DNA, and the SRM in the N-terminal region of Sgo1 is a novel functional domain of Sgo1 protein. The SRM region serves as a platform for recruitment of Rts1-PP2A and condensin to the centromere. A ""Sgo1-mini"" protein, consisting of the coiled-coil region required for its dimerization and interaction with Rts1, the SRM important for the recruitment of condensin, and the H2A-binding motif within the basic region that ensures localization of Sgo1 to the centromere, partially rescues the growth defects of sgo1Δ cells on benomyl plates and the sensitivity of sgo1Δ cells to high levels of syntelic attachments caused by Cik1-cc overexpression."
Lay Summary:White blood cells, specifically T cells, play a crucial role in identifying and attacking pathogens in the human body. To enable applications like vaccine design, cancer neoantigen identification, development of diagnostics, and removal of unwanted immune responses, T cell epitope candidates are commonly identified using computational prediction tools. Most of these tools are based on machine learning algorithms trained on MHC binding or naturally processed MHC ligand elution data. However, the ability of these tools to predict T cell epitopes has not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, the researchers used a dataset of T cell epitopes recognized in vaccinia virus (VACV) infected mice and evaluated the performance of all currently publicly available computational T cell epitope prediction tools to identify these major epitopes from all peptides encoded in the VACV proteome. They found that all methods were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data. These methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top predictions. These performance metrics provide guidance for immunologists as to which prediction methods to use and what success rates are possible for epitope predictions. This benchmark was implemented in an open and easy to reproduce format, providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools. This research is crucial in the field of immunology, as it provides a comprehensive evaluation of computational T cell epitope prediction tools, helping to improve the accuracy of epitope predictions and further understand the immune response to pathogens.
This text is a research paper about the study of DNA modification, specifically DNA methylation, in relation to genome analysis, genetics, and cell biology. The researchers used blood and sperm samples from lean and obese males to analyze tissue covariation of DNA methylation and identify obesity-associated methylomic signatures. They found that DNA methylation signatures of human blood and spermatozoa are highly discordant, and methylation levels are correlated at only a minority of CpG sites. Obesity-associated DNA methylation in blood was not generally reflected in spermatozoa. The researchers also identified one obesity-specific hypermethylated site in sperm, but it was not significantly associated with obesity in blood. The study suggests that spermatozoal DNA methylation is an unlikely mediator of intergenerational effects of metabolic traits. In simpler terms, the study found that the pattern of DNA methylation in sperm is unique and not closely related to the pattern in blood, and obesity is not significantly associated with DNA methylation in sperm.
Reovirus is a type of virus that can infect the central nervous system (CNS), causing encephalitis in newborn animals. It has a broad host range and can cause age-restricted disease in humans. Reovirus is neurotropic, meaning it preferentially infects nerve cells. It has two serotypes, T1 and T3, which have different patterns of dissemination and tissue tropism within the CNS. T1 reovirus spreads primarily through hematogenous routes and infects ependyma, while T3 reovirus spreads by both hematogenous and neural routes and infects CNS neurons. The mechanism by which reovirus enters and is transported within neurons is not well understood.To study the mechanisms of reovirus neuronal entry and transport, researchers used primary neuron cultures and microfluidic devices. They found that reovirus uses a different mechanism of entry in neurons (macropinocytosis) compared to non-neuronal cells (clathrin-mediated endocytosis). Reovirus is capable of retrograde but only limited anterograde neuronal transmission. The dynamics of retrograde reovirus movement are consistent with fast axonal transport coordinated by dynein along microtubules. Reovirus is transported in non-acidified vesicles and is released into the cytoplasm after the vesicles acidify in the soma. These findings define mechanisms of reovirus neuronal entry and transport and establish a foundation to identify common host factors used by neuroinvasive viruses. They also highlight the importance of considering cell type-specific entry mechanisms in the design of neurotropic viruses as tracers, oncolytic agents, and delivery vectors.
Vaccines are crucial for controlling malaria, a major global health concern with an estimated 229 million cases and 409,000 deaths in 2019. However, drug-resistance is a growing issue, particularly in Africa where the majority of cases occur. An effective vaccine is needed to limit the spread of resistance and decrease disease and death. The most advanced vaccine, RTS, S/AS01, has shown protection of around 50% within the first 14 months in phase 3 clinical trials in Africa, but its efficacy declines over time due to waning anti-CSP antibody titers. A related vaccine candidate, R21, has shown promising results in a recent phase 2 clinical trial in Burkina Faso with efficacy levels of 74% and 77% in low- and high-dose adjuvant groups, respectively. However, like RTS, S/AS01, R21-induced anti-NANP antibody titers quickly wane over time.The C-terminal region of the Plasmodium falciparum CSP (ctCSP) has been shown to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the process of liver cell invasion and contains a polymorphic region (α-ctCSP) and a previously undescribed site on the conserved β-sheet face (β-ctCSP). Antibodies to the β-ctCSP site exhibit broad reactivity with a diverse panel of ctCSP peptides, making it a promising target for prophylactic antibodies and structure-based vaccine design.In this study, seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the C-terminal domain of CSP were expressed and characterized from volunteers immunized with RTS, S/AS01. Two different sites were identified on opposite faces of ctCSP: the previously characterized α-ctCSP and the undescribed β-ctCSP. Antibodies to the β-ctCSP site showed broad reactivity with a diverse panel of ctCSP peptides, while antibodies to the α-ctCSP site showed limited cross-reactivity. An antibody to the β-site demonstrated inhibition activity against malaria infection in a murine model, making it a promising target for vaccine design.
Lysine malonylation is a post-translational modification that regulates many cellular processes in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This modification varies between different strains of the parasite, which can affect its virulence and the expression of virulence factors. In this study, the researchers profiled lysine malonylation in T. gondii using quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immuno-affinity purification. They compared lysine malonylation between three strains of T. gondii with distinctive pathogenicity in mice: RH strain (type I), PRU strain (type II), and VEG strain (type III). They found that there were 111 differentially malonylated proteins and 152 sites upregulated, and 17 proteins and 17 sites downregulated in RH strain versus PRU strain; 50 proteins and 59 sites were upregulated, and 50 proteins and 53 sites were downregulated in RH strain versus VEG strain; and 72 proteins and 90 sites were upregulated, and 7 proteins and 8 sites were downregulated in VEG strain versus PRU strain. These differentially malonylated proteins were involved in key processes such as those mediating the regulation of protein metabolism, stress response, glycolysis, and actin cytoskeleton. These results suggest an association between lysine malonylation and intra-species virulence differences in T. gondii and offer a new resource for elucidating the contribution of lysine malonylation to energy metabolism and virulence in T. gondii.
The text provided discusses research on nematodes, which are multicellular organisms that exhibit complex behaviors controlled by a neuromuscular system. Nematodes have a greater number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits than vertebrates, leading to diverse pharmacological sensitivities. This diversity makes them attractive targets for anthelmintic drugs. The researchers focused on a specific nAChR subunit, EAT-2, and its interaction with another protein, EAT-18. They found that EAT-2 can form a homomeric ligand-gated cation selective ion-channel when co-expressed with EAT-18. This receptor channel has different contact residues in the ligand binding pocket and possibly a different pharmacology from other nAChRs. The C-terminal regions of EAT-18 differ between C. elegans and other organisms, suggesting that the receptor channel will have different pharmacological properties in different organisms. The researchers also identified that EAT-18 is distinct from another protein, LEV-10, and is not involved in conferring levamisole resistance. The research provides insight into the diversity and complexity of nAChRs and their potential as drug targets.
HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, infects cells called CD4 T lymphocytes (CD4TL) by binding to chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. The CXCR4-using viruses are considered more harmful and are linked to faster depletion of CD4TL and progression to AIDS. However, not all CXCR4-using viruses are equally harmful, suggesting that there is variability in their virulence. In this study, the researchers investigated the role of the CXCR4 chemokine CXCL12 in the virulence of HIV-1. They found that CXCL12 prevents HIV-1 from binding CXCR4 and entering CD4TL in a test tube. However, its role in HIV-1 transmission and propagation in the body is not well understood. The researchers analyzed 30 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) from patients at different stages of infection and found that Envs resistant to CXCL12 are more common in patients with low CD4TL levels, most often late in infection. These Envs adopt a more closed conformation with distinct antigenicity compared to CXCL12-sensitive Envs. At the host cell level, resistance is not due to improved fusion or binding to CD4, but is due to viruses using particular CXCR4 molecules that are weakly accessible to CXCL12. The researchers also found that resistance provides viruses with an enhanced capacity to enter naive CD4TL when surrounded by CXCL12, which mirrors their situation in lymphoid organs, and to deplete bystander activated effector memory cells. This suggests that RES viruses are more likely to deregulate CD4TL homeostasis. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the pathophysiology and the transmission of HIV-1 and suggests that RES viruses’ receptors could represent new therapeutic targets to help prevent CD4TL depletion in HIV+ patients on cART.
Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a disease in Palestine, spread by sand flies that live in hyrax dens. These sand flies carry the Leishmania parasite, which causes ZCL. Even though control measures have been in place since 1996, ZCL cases still occur. A study was done in Tayasir, Tubas district, to see if insecticide thermal fogging inside hyrax dens could reduce sand fly density and Leishmania infection. The study found that fogging hyrax dens reduced sand fly abundance and leishmania infection during the 5-week post-intervention period, suggesting it could be an effective source-reduction measure for ZCL vectors. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.
Pseudoknot (PK) structures in the non-coding regions of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA genomes are important for gene expression regulation. The 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of FMDV RNA is longer than in other picornaviruses and has multiple putative PKs. The role of these PKs in FMDV infection is not fully understood. Researchers used bioinformatics, sub-genomic replicons, and recombinant viruses to investigate the structural conservation and importance of PKs in the FMDV lifecycle. They found that a replicon lacking PKs was replication competent but at reduced levels, and replicons with less than two PKs were outcompeted by replicons with four PKs. Viruses completely lacking PKs were not viable, suggesting a role for PKs in virion assembly. The study improves understanding of FMDV molecular biology and PKs' roles in RNA functions.
This text is about a study on the palatability of two new orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulations of a drug called Praziquantel (PZQ), which is used to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. The current tablet formulation of PZQ is not suitable for pre-school age children due to its bitterness and large size. The study was conducted in a school in Tanzania with children aged 6-11 years, with or without schistosomiasis infection. The children were given the new ODT formulations of PZQ, either disintegrated in the mouth without water or dispersed in water, and the currently available PZQ 600 mg formulation (PZQ-Cesol) crushed and dispersed in water. The palatability of each formulation was rated using a visual analogue scale. The study found that both ODT formulations were more palatable than the existing standard formulation of PZQ, and there may be gender and age effects on the assessment of palatability. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the newly ODTs Praziquantel drug in younger children.
A significant challenge in healthcare is drug resistance in viruses. A research team has discovered a new way to treat all human and animal herpesviruses, as well as other viral infections with genome-pressure-dependent replication, by targeting the pressurized genome state in a viral capsid. This novel mechanism of action (MOA) prevents viral genome ejection into a cell nucleus, blocking viral replication and potentially preventing the development of drug resistance. This approach is also a valuable strategy for preventing the spread of emerging viruses where vaccine development is challenging due to high mutation rates or other evasion mechanisms.The herpesviridae family includes nine human pathogens, causing various diseases such as recurrent acute oral and genital lesions, encephalitis, shingles, and oncogenic transformation. Existing antiviral drugs have limitations, such as significant toxicities, resistance, and ineffectiveness against DNA release into the cell nucleus. The research team focused on finding antiviral targets independent of viral proteins. They discovered that the mechanically stressed and pressurized state of strongly confined viral DNA packaged in a herpesvirus capsid is an evolutionarily static target for antiviral therapies.Herpesviruses consist of a double-stranded DNA genome packaged within a protein shell, or capsid, which is surrounded by an unstructured protein layer and a lipid envelope. After binding at the plasma membrane, the viral lipid envelope is lost, and partially tegumented viral capsids enter the cell cytoplasm and are transported toward the nucleus. The viral capsid ejects its genome upon docking at a nuclear pore complex, forming a passageway for molecular traffic into the nucleus.The research team found that the high internal DNA pressure of 20 atmospheres in HSV-1 capsids results from genome confinement. They demonstrated that this pressure powers ejection of the viral genome into a cell nucleus during HSV-1 infection. Additionally, they discovered that adding polyvalent cations that penetrate the viral capsid can strongly reduce or eliminate intracapsid DNA pressure. In this study, the team identified compounds (small polycationic molecules with molecular weights of <800 Da) that permeate the herpesvirus lipid envelope and capsid pores, bind to intracapsid DNA, and condense the packaged genome, thereby removing the capsid genome pressure. These compounds halt viral DNA ejection into a nucleus, presenting a new class of broad-spectrum treatments for all nine human herpesviruses as well as animal herpesviruses.
The Nancowry group of islands, located in the Indian territory, are home to a population of 7674 people. These islands are covered in forests and are prone to mosquito-borne diseases. A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of mass drug administration on lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission by monitoring the infection in mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected using three different methods: BG sentinel traps, human bait double bed net traps, and human bait double bed net traps. A total of 220 mosquitoes were collected, with Ae. niveus being the least common species, making up only 10.9% of the total collected. Other mosquito species collected include Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. edwardsi, Ae. malayensis, and Armigeres subalbatus. The results showed that the prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti DNA in Ae. niveus was low, indicating that mass drug administration has had a positive impact on reducing LF transmission. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to standardize the protocol for using molecular xenomonitoring as a surveillance tool for evaluating interventions in this area.
USP12 is a protein that interacts with another protein called CBP, which is involved in various cellular functions such as proliferation, cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, and DNA damage responses. USP12 has been found to constitutively bind with CBP in cells and can inhibit CBP's acetyltransferase activity, which is the process of adding an acetyl group to a protein. This inhibition of CBP's acetyltransferase activity by USP12 can affect the acetylation of various proteins, including CBP itself, p300, HDAC1, and STAT1.In innate antiviral immunity, USP12 plays a role in regulating CBP's acetylation action and therefore restricting excessive activation of IFN signaling in intact cells. Specifically, in IFN signaling, knockdown of USP12 promotes acetylation of IFNAR2 and STAT2, and in turn promotes the formation of the ISGF3 transcriptional complex for IFN signaling activation.Additionally, USP12 has been found to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in IFN signaling, which could promote the activation of IFN signaling. Furthermore, overexpression of USP12 upregulates IFN-induced levels of p-STAT1 and enhances ISRE-luciferase activity, while USP12 knockdown decreases IFN-induced ISRE-luciferase activity. Overall, USP12 is a positive regulator of IFN signaling.In conclusion, USP12 is a protein that interacts with CBP and plays a role in regulating CBP's acetylation action, which affects the acetylation of various proteins and plays a role in innate antiviral immunity. USP12 has been found to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in IFN signaling, which could promote the activation of IFN signaling. USP12 is a positive regulator of IFN signaling.
A study has discovered two new viruses, Melao virus (MELV) and Oropouche virus (OROV), in children from Haiti with acute febrile illness. These viruses were previously unknown to cause illness in humans. MELV was found in five children and caused abdominal pain and lymphadenopathy, while OROV RNA was found in one child and is known to cause fever and rash syndromes. The study highlights the importance of viral genome sequence analyses in identifying outbreaks caused by emerging viruses. The study also emphasizes the need for ongoing surveillance, as these viruses have not been previously reported in Haiti. Early identification and monitoring of emerging viruses are crucial for preventing and controlling outbreaks.
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had significant economic impacts and resulted in over 2.6 million deaths worldwide as of March 2021. Vaccines have been approved for emergency use, but the pandemic remains a global threat. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a major target for vaccine development. A DNA vaccine containing the spike gene was developed and found to induce similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2 in both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization groups. However, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. DNA vaccination has several advantages, including easy design and production, stability at a range of temperatures, and low production cost, making it suitable for rapid and large-scale manufacturing during infectious disease outbreaks. DNA vaccines can effectively stimulate cellular and humoral responses against pathogens in challenge models and have been shown to be safe and effective candidates for treating or preventing infectious diseases such as HIV-1, Zika virus, Ebola virus, MERS-CoV, and influenza viruses. A DNA vaccine delivered via electroporation was developed into a phase 1 clinical trial within 7 months during the Zika virus outbreak in 2015. EP combined with DNA vaccination greatly increases the efficacy of DNA vaccines. A DNA vaccination with EP has been shown to induce neutralizing antibody and Th1-biased immune responses in hamsters, resulting in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease that can cause long-term disability, including lymphedema, elephantiasis, and hydrocele. While mass drug administration (MDA) has been successful in reducing LF transmission, there is a need for better access to morbidity management and disability prevention services (MMDP) for those with chronic manifestations of the disease. In Zambia, there is limited information on health beliefs and health-seeking behavior towards MMDP services for LF.A study was conducted to document health beliefs and health-seeking behavior towards MMDP services for LF in Luangwa District, Zambia. The study found that community members had limited knowledge of MMDP services and home-based care strategies for lymphedema. Health-seeking behavior was driven by negative beliefs about the causes of LF and lack of awareness of available MMDP services and homecare strategies.The perceived causes of LF included contact with animal feces, use of traditional herbal aphrodisiacs, witchcraft, and sexual contact with menstruating or post-miscarriage women. LF patients often opted to visit traditional healers before going to health facilities. Hydrocele patients were afraid of hydrocelectomies as they were thought to cause infertility or death.Health system and cultural barriers to seeking healthcare included long distances to health facilities, lack of awareness of existing MMDP services, perceived costs of accessing MMDP services, gender and social norms, and fear of stigmatization.In conclusion, the study found that health education campaigns are needed to address patients' concerns surrounding access to care, including fear of taking up hydrocele surgery due to perceived side-effects of the procedure. Health education campaigns should also seek to create awareness of existing free-of-charge MMDP services and strengthen referral systems to ensure LF patients not only get appropriate care but are also regularly followed-up and linked to other critical social services to enhance their quality of life. MMDP programs should also empower and motivate LF patients and their families to overcome health systems and cultural barriers to accessing care.
White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are crucial for immune response in humans. They help to protect the body from harmful pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. In this text, the focus is on Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), a virus that infects T-cells. HTLV-1 is a delta-retrovirus that affects around 5-10 million people worldwide. It is transmitted through body fluids like blood, semen, and breast milk. Once inside the body, HTLV-1 infects its target cells, CD4+ T-cells, and to a lesser extent, CD8+ T-cells, dendritic cells, or monocytes. The virus then integrates into the host cell genome and persists in its provirus form, which is flanked by long terminal repeats. HTLV-1 encodes regulatory (Tax, Rex) and accessory (p12/p8, p13, p30, HBZ) proteins. The research paper discusses p8, a cleavage product of the viral accessory p12 protein encoded by open reading frame (orf) I. P8 is a 70 amino acid protein that localizes to the cytoplasm and is recruited to lipid rafts and the immunological synapse upon T-cell receptor ligation. In this study, the researchers identified Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) as a novel interaction partner of p8. VASP is a member of the Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) family and plays a crucial role in p8 and HTLV-1 Gag cell-to-cell transfer. VASP contains an EVH1 domain that targets the protein to focal adhesions, and the researchers suggest that a short stretch in p8 (amino acids 24-45) mediates interactions with the EVH1 domain of VASP. Co-immunoprecipitations confirmed interactions of VASP:p8 in 293T, Jurkat and HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells. Co-precipitation of VASP:p8 could be significantly blocked by peptides mimicking aa 26-37 of p8. Mutational studies revealed that the EVH1-domain of VASP is necessary, but not sufficient for the interaction with p8. Further, deletion of the VASP G- and F-actin binding domains significantly diminished co-precipitation of p8. Imaging identified areas of partial co-localization of VASP with p8 at the plasma membrane and in protrusive structures, which was confirmed by proximity ligation assays. Co-culture experiments revealed that repression of both endogenous and overexpressed VASP by RNA interference or by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced p8 transfer to the cell surface and to target Jurkat T-cells. Stable repression of VASP by RNA interference in chronically infected MT-2 cells impaired both p8 and HTLV-1 Gag transfer to target Jurkat T-cells, while virus release was unaffected. Thus, the researchers identified VASP as a novel interaction partner of p8, which is important for transfer of HTLV-1 p8 and Gag to target T-cells.
Tinnitus, a common form of auditory hallucination, can be caused by hearing loss or damage to higher auditory processing pathways. It is related to brain activity in sensory networks that occurs in the absence of external input. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is known to display tinnitus-related plastic reorganization following cochlear damage and is thought to be a key player in tinnitus generation. A recent study used a bimodal auditory-sensory stimulation treatment paradigm in both guinea pigs and humans, which successfully modulated the percept of tinnitus and reduced its loudness. However, existing computational models for tinnitus often do not take into account long-term neural plasticity.A new study uses an objective-driven learning algorithm to model an early auditory processing neuronal network, specifically the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The learning algorithm maximizes the network’s output entropy by learning the feed-forward and recurrent interactions in the model. The study found that attenuation of peripheral inputs drives the recurrent network towards its critical point and transition into a tinnitus-like state, where the network activity resembles responses to genuine inputs even in the absence of external stimulation, mimicking auditory responses. These findings demonstrate how objective-driven plasticity mechanisms that normally act to optimize the network’s input representation can also elicit pathologies such as tinnitus as a result of sensory deprivation.
Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a type of coronavirus that can infect the nervous system of mice, causing symptoms such as loss of smell and taste, lethargy, and neurological issues. The virus mainly infects the brain and spinal cord, but not other organs like the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidney, small intestine, colon, or blood. When the virus infects the brain, it can cause inflammation and damage to nerve cells. The virus is primarily found in nerve cells, such as neurons, and is rarely found in other types of brain cells like astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendroglia. PHEV is able to cross the neural-mucosal interface in the nose and infect the olfactory bulb in the brain. The virus can also be found in the olfactory nerves that connect the nose and the brain. In addition to the olfactory route, PHEV may also use the trigeminal nerve in the respiratory epithelium of the nose as an alternative route for neuroinvasion. The virus can be transported along axons within the brain, leading to rapid and transneuronal spread of the virus from initial sites to connected areas within the CNS. The infection of PHEV in the nose can also lead to tissue damage and inflammation in the olfactory epithelium, potentially contributing to olfactory dysfunction.
Glucose metabolism is crucial for the health and development of animals and humans. It is especially important for tissues like the brain and red blood cells, which rely on glucose for energy. Glucose can be obtained from food or produced by the body through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen, a stored form of glucose, into glucose, while gluconeogenesis is the process of creating glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. These processes are regulated by various factors, including steroid and thyroid hormones, and transcription factors like Krüppel-like factors (KLFs). KLFs are transcriptional regulators that respond to nuclear receptors of steroid and thyroid hormones to promote or repress downstream genes transcription. They play roles in extending lifespan in an autophagy-dependent manner and are involved in the metabolic regulation.A study was conducted using the holometabolous insect Helicoverpa armigera, or cotton bollworm, as a model to understand the molecular mechanisms by which organisms regulate the glucose metabolism homeostasis from a feeding state switching to a non-feeding state. The study found that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) upregulated the expression of transcription factor Krüppel-like factor (Klf15) to promote macroautophagy/autophagy, apoptosis and gluconeogenesis during metamorphosis. 20E promotes Klf15 expression through its nuclear receptor EcR. Knockdown of Klf15 delayed pupation and repressed autophagy and apoptosis of larval fat body during metamorphosis. KLF15 promoted autophagic flux and transiting to apoptosis. KLF15 bound to the KLF binding site (KLF bs) in the promoter of Atg8 (autophagy-related gene 8/LC3) to upregulate Atg8 expression. Knockdown Atg8 reduced free fatty acids (FFAs), glycerol, free amino acids (FAAs), and glucose levels. Glycolysis was switched to gluconeogenesis, trehalose and glycogen synthesis were changed to degradation during metamorphosis. These variations were accompanied by the variation of the related genes expression.In conclusion, this study reveals the molecular mechanisms by which the steroid hormone 20E regulates the glucose metabolism homeostasis during metamorphosis in Helicoverpa armigera. The study found that 20E upregulated the expression of transcription factor Krüppel-like factor (Klf15) to promote macroautophagy/autophagy, apoptosis and gluconeogenesis during metamorphosis. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of glucose metabolism during metamorphosis in insects and may have implications for the understanding of glucose metabolism regulation in other organisms.
The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the primary target of COVID-19 vaccines and plays a crucial role in viral entry into host cells. Researchers performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a system containing a viral membrane patch with four S proteins to identify potential antibody binding sites. The simulations revealed that the glycan coat shields a larger surface area than expected and has a low epitope score due to its flexibility. The study also demonstrated that glycans are not only shields but also play a role in the infection mechanism. The research provides valuable insights into the structure and behavior of the S protein, which could help in the design of more effective vaccines and therapies.
Type I interferons (IFNs) are important for protecting the body against viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In a study using Syrian hamsters, researchers found that giving IFN-α through the nose before or soon after infection with SARS-CoV-2 helped limit weight loss and reduce the amount of virus in the lungs. However, giving IFN-α later in the course of infection, when symptoms began, did not have any effect. These results suggest that the timing of IFN treatment is important for its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. Early treatment may help, but treatment started later in the course of the disease is unlikely to be helpful and is not associated with any harmful effects. These findings may have implications for the use of IFNs as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in humans.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, and it affects over 250 million people worldwide. It is transmitted through freshwater snails, which serve as intermediate hosts for the parasite. Identifying these snails is crucial for controlling the spread of the disease, as different snail species host different Schistosoma species. Currently, identification methods rely on morphology and DNA analysis, but these have limitations. A new study explores the use of MALDI-TOF MS, a technology that has revolutionized clinical microbiology, for snail identification.The study collected 619 snails from schistosomiasis-endemic areas in Senegal and identified them as Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Bulinus truncatus, Bulinus senegalensis, Lymnaea natalensis, Melanoides tuberculata, Bellamya unicolor, and Cleopatra bulimoides. The researchers extracted proteins from the snails and analyzed them using MALDI-TOF MS. They found that the MS spectra for each snail species were specific, allowing for accurate identification of the snails.The researchers then assessed the reproducibility and specificity of the method by analyzing 127 frozen snails and 74 laboratory-reared snails from three species (Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Bulinus truncatus, and Bulinus senegalensis) using the selected protocol. The results showed high reproducibility and specificity, with the dots corresponding to MS spectra from different species separated from each other.The study demonstrates that MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable tool for rapid and accurate identification of frozen and ethanol-stored freshwater snails, without the need for malacological expertise. This technology could be a game-changer in the control of schistosomiasis by enabling rapid and accurate identification of the snail hosts of Schistosoma parasites. Further studies are needed to validate this method in different settings and explore its potential for large-scale applications.
A study was conducted to develop a smartphone-based microscopic method for detecting Cryptosporidium and Giardia cysts in vegetables and water samples. The method involved using a sapphire ball lens and an aluminum mounting plate to transform a smartphone into a microscope. The ball lens was attached to the smartphone camera lens and the mounting plate was fixed onto the smartphone. A microscope stage was built to hold the sample slide and a light source was used to illuminate the sample. Three ball lenses with different diameters were tested and the one with a diameter of 1 mm was chosen for further experiments. Two different light sources and two types of stains were also tested. The staining experiments involved mixing Cryptosporidium and Giardia cysts with a dye and viewing the images through the smartphone microscope. The contrast of the images was calculated to determine the presence of the cysts. Five types of vegetables were selected for spike recovery experiments, which involved adding a known number of cysts to the vegetables and then extracting them using different washing solutions. The eluate was then concentrated by centrifugation and the pellet was dissolved in citric acid lysis buffer. The sample was washed twice with distilled water and the pellets were resuspended in 5 mL distilled water for the purification of the cysts. The purification steps were only required with contaminated water, whereas non-contaminated water could be pelleted and subjected to microscopy. The purification steps involved a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The gradient was prepared with Sheather's solution and 0.25M ferric sulphate solution was added to the water samples to precipitate floc. The supernatant was carefully aspirated with a syringe filter and the pellet was dissolved in citric acid lysis buffer. The sample was washed twice with distilled water by centrifugation. The pellets collected were resuspended in 5 mL distilled water for the purification of cysts. Ten microliters of each concentrated sample were stained with diluted Lugol's iodine and subsequently loaded into a hemocytometer. The sample was incubated for 6 minutes and the cysts were screened and enumerated in four quadrants of the hemocytometer under the smartphone microscope. The cysts were also examined with a fluorescent microscope. The mean percentage recovery efficiency was calculated as the number of cysts recovered from the sample divided by the number of cysts added to the sample. The recovery efficiency increased with smaller sample size, lower volume of elution buffer and minimum level of interfering particles. To obtain a better limit of detection, higher number of cysts should be spiked for larger amount of sample to start with. The procedure was followed excluding the washing of raw vegetables and spiking with cysts to determine the cyst contamination in the vegetable samples collected from local markets. The un-spiked vegetable samples were bought from randomly selected ten different fruits and vegetable markets of Kathmandu, Nepal. The samples were 28 cabbage, 10 carrots, 37 cucumber, 40 green chilli, 10 radish, 31 spinach and 40 tomato (total n = 196). The vegetable samples were proceeded according to Environmental Protection Agency method 1623 and Codex Alimentarius CAC/GL 33 (FAO, 1999). The vegetable samples were transported in a cooler box to the laboratory for further analysis. The analytical parameters such as limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were used to check the analytical performance of the smartphone method.
Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease that affects people in China, particularly in the western region. It is caused by larval stages of tapeworms from the genus Echinococcus. The two main forms found in China are cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE). CE is caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus, while AE is caused by the larvae of Echinococcus multilocularis. In 2018, there were 47,278 recorded cases of human echinococcosis in China, with a prevalence rate of 10.57 per 10,000 people. The majority of cases were CE (71.02%), followed by AE (21.99%).The prevalence of echinococcosis varies across different provinces and even between endemic counties within the same province. The epidemic degree is classified according to the prevalence rate in humans and the infection rate in dogs. Class I epidemic counties have prevalence rates higher than or equal to 100/10,000, Class II counties display prevalence rates between 10/10,000 and 100/10,000, Class III counties have prevalence rates between 0 and 10/10,000, and Class IV counties have no cases of human echinococcosis.In 2018, there were 29 Class I epidemic counties (7.84%), 96 Type II counties (25.95%), and 210 Type III counties (56.76%). There were also 35 Class IV counties with no cases of human echinococcosis reported in 2018. CE and AE were analyzed and classified independently. There were 21 Class I counties for CE and 6 Class I counties for AE.The global spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that positive spatial autocorrelation and aggregation distribution were present for human echinococcosis. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) for CE significance cluster map showed the presence of two kinds of clusters: high-high and low-high clusters. High-high clusters were mainly distributed in Tibet, western Qinghai, and the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan, with a positive correlation in spatial distribution. Low-high clusters were distributed in Coqeen county in Tibet, with a negative correlation in spatial distribution. The LISA of human AE indicated the existence of high-high clusters only.Spatial scan statistics were performed independently for human CE and AE in the 370 endemic counties using SaTScan. The most likely clusters for human CE were found in the north of the Tibet Autonomous Region, with a relative risk (RR) value of 21 and involving about 5.3 million exposed people. With respect to human AE, the most likely clusters were found in the Tarlag county of the Qinghai province, with a RR of up to 305.82. This is a very serious situation, as it indicates a high risk of transmission in those endemic counties.
This text discusses the impact of different immunization strategies on preventing or mitigating outbreaks of contagion in a population. Two commonly used strategies are degree immunization, where nodes with many connections are immunized, and betweenness immunization, which selects nodes based on their importance in connecting different communities. Stochastic immunization algorithms rely on local network data rather than global data. One such strategy, acquaintance immunization, immunizes nodes that are frequently neighbors of randomly selected nodes. This strategy can identify hubs without a costly network census.The text explores the effectiveness of these immunization strategies under realistic conditions where data may be incomplete or missing. Missing data can arise due to various reasons, such as insufficient time or resources to gather information about everyone in the network or respondents providing incomplete information. Incomplete data can affect the measurement of network properties and the rank order of nodes, potentially leading to the selection of sub-optimal nodes for immunization.The study finds that stochastic strategies, like acquaintance immunization, can be more robust to missing data in some cases, but still require a comprehensive list of nodes and accurate local information about their neighbors. Critical nodes can still be overlooked if they are missing from the local information or if some of their neighborhood is missing.The study aims to test the effectiveness of targeted immunization strategies under different assumptions about data availability, as limited studies have considered missing data problems related to network contagion and immunization. The study uses synthetic networks with similar properties as the well-known Colorado Springs high-risk network and school networks to test the validity of different immunization strategies.In conclusion, the study examines the effectiveness of immunization strategies under realistic conditions where data may be incomplete or missing. Missing data can have important consequences for choosing an immunization strategy, as it can affect the measurement of network properties and the rank order of nodes. The study finds that stochastic strategies, like acquaintance immunization, can be more robust to missing data in some cases but still require accurate local information about nodes and their neighbors.
Lay Summary: This text discusses the use of extracellular recording to study brain physiology and pathology. Extracellular potential is a result of ion motion in tissue, driven by ionic currents through ion channels in neuronal and glial membranes, as well as capacitive currents. The distribution of these current sources is called Current Source Density (CSD). Kernel Current Source Density (kCSD) estimation is a two-step procedure, where the first step involves interpolating the measured potential to obtain the potential in the whole space, and the second step involves moving the solution to the CSD space. The text also discusses the use of kernel functions, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors in kCSD estimation. The text also discusses the use of kCSD in reconstructing current sources in the brain and the challenges of source placement in real brains. The text also discusses the use of kCSD in reconstructing current sources in simulated and model data.
Malaria is a serious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. In this study, the researchers investigated the interactions between four major species of Plasmodium that infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), Plasmodium vivax (Pv), Plasmodium malariae (Pm), and Plasmodium ovale (Po). These parasites belong to the group of organisms called protozoans, which are single-celled organisms that can cause diseases in humans and other animals.The study found that co-infections with these Plasmodium species were more common than expected, and the excess risk of co-infection was 1.38 for all parasites and 1.37 for gametocytes. This means that people were more likely to be infected with multiple species of Plasmodium at the same time than would be expected if the infections were random. The study also found that co-infections were more common in some villages, which suggests that heterogeneity in exposure to mosquitoes is an important factor in the transmission of these parasites.The study also developed molecular assays for detecting asexual and gametocyte stages of Pf, Pv, Pm, and Po. This is the first description of molecular diagnostics for Pm and Po gametocytes. These assays were implemented in a unique epidemiological setting in Papua New Guinea with sympatric transmission of all four Plasmodium species, allowing for a comprehensive investigation of species interactions.In conclusion, this study found that co-infections with Plasmodium species are more common than expected, and this excess co-infection risk is partially attributable to malaria infections clustering in some villages. The study also developed molecular assays for detecting asexual and gametocyte stages of Pf, Pv, Pm, and Po, which will be useful for future studies on the transmission and control of malaria.
DNA modification plays a crucial role in cancers and neoplasms, and its relationship with genes and nucleic acids is a popular area of research in chemistry, genetics, and biochemistry. Aberrant changes in methylation have been shown to cause complex diseases, including cancers, by regulating gene expression. Mediation analysis is a flexible means to interpret the interplay between DNA methylation, gene expression, and diseases. In this study, the researchers developed a new method called IUSMMT to examine the mediation effect of DNA methylation on the survival risk of cancers through gene expression. IUSMMT effectively fits an empirical three-component mixture null distribution and demonstrated its advantage over existing methods through extensive simulation studies. The researchers applied IUSMMT to ten TCGA cancers and identified multiple genes that exhibited mediating effects from DNA methylation CpG sites to the survival risk of various types of cancers. These findings suggest that IUSMMT represents an effective and powerful alternative for survival mediation analysis and provides new insights into the functional role of DNA methylation and gene expression in cancer progression/prognosis, demonstrating potential therapeutic targets for future clinical practice.
Developmental plasticity is the ability of an organism to develop different traits in response to environmental changes. This study investigates the genetic basis of predatory vs non-predatory dimorphism in a type of nematode called Pristionchus pacificus. The researchers found that the gene regulatory network controlling this dimorphism consists of genes of different ages. They identified two key genes, nhr-1 and nhr-40, which are nuclear hormone receptors that control mouth-form determination. NHR-1 disrupts mouth-form determination, resulting in a mix of features from both wild-type morphs, while nhr-40 alters morph ratios without producing intermediate morphology. Both genes share transcriptional targets that encode extracellular proteins resulting from lineage-specific expansions. These genes are rapidly evolving and have no orthologs in Caenorhabditis elegans. The study suggests that the origin of feeding plasticity in these nematodes involves novelty at the level of genes, cells, and behavior.
Mitochondria, which are organelles found inside cells, play a crucial role in the functioning of the cell. They are particularly important in maintaining calcium dynamics, which is the way that calcium levels inside the cell are regulated. Calcium is a vital substance that helps with many cellular processes, but too much or too little can be harmful. Mitochondria help to maintain the right balance of calcium in the cell by storing and releasing it as needed.In this study, researchers used a computer model to understand how mitochondria help to regulate calcium dynamics. The model included mitochondrial calcium cycling and complex signaling pathways. The researchers found that when mitochondria become depolarized, or lose their electrical charge, it can lead to abnormal calcium dynamics, specifically a pattern called calcium alternans. This can be harmful to the cell.The researchers also found that reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are molecules that can damage cells, play a role in this process. Specifically, they found that an increase in ROS in response to mitochondrial depolarization can promote calcium alternans. They also found that certain signaling pathways, such as those involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), can affect calcium dynamics and potentially contribute to the development of calcium alternans.In conclusion, mitochondria play a crucial role in maintaining calcium dynamics within cells. Mitochondrial depolarization can lead to abnormal calcium dynamics, and ROS and certain signaling pathways can contribute to this process. Further research is needed to better understand this process and to develop potential treatments for conditions that involve abnormal calcium dynamics.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a disease that is transmitted to humans through infected rodents, resulting in fever, hemorrhage, and renal dysfunction. In China, HFRS is a significant public health concern, with over 1.56 million cases reported since the 1950s. The disease is particularly prevalent in rural areas and is associated with poverty, poor living conditions, and close contact with infected rodents.A recent study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of HFRS in Xi'an City, China from 2005 to 2018. The study used surveyed HFRS data and satellite imagery to conduct geostatistical analysis. The results showed that HFRS cases in Xi'an City exhibited a clustered pattern, with most cases occurring in the middle region of the city. The study also found that rapid urbanization and the presence of water bodies significantly affected the incidence of HFRS. The association of water bodies with the HFRS incidence rate was found to be higher within the radii of 696.15 m and 1575.39 m, representing significant thresholds. These findings suggest that geomatics approaches can be useful for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of HFRS and supporting effective resource allocation to prevent epidemics.Overall, HFRS is a significant public health concern in China, particularly in rural areas. The study found that rapid urbanization and the presence of water bodies significantly affected the incidence of HFRS. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impacts of environmental and socioeconomic factors when developing strategies for preventing and controlling infectious diseases.
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that infects the stomach of around half of the world's population and can lead to diseases like gastric and duodenal ulcers, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer. While antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors are typically used for treatment, the bacteria's genetic diversity can affect treatment efficacy and disease severity. A single individual infected with H. pylori was the source of 39 clinical isolates, collected from multiple gastric sites at two time points over six years. Whole genome sequence analysis identified 1,767 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.3x10-4 substitutions/site/year. These genetic variations clustered isolates from each time point separately and were linked to phenotypic differences in bacterial morphology, ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, and mouse colonization. These findings suggest complex selective forces and multiple niches within the stomach during chronic infection. This research highlights the importance of understanding within-host diversity and its contribution to H. pylori pathogenesis.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, including Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworms, are common in tropical and subtropical countries with inadequate sanitation. Over 1.5 billion people are infected with at least one of these helminth species, causing significant morbidity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive chemotherapy (PC), periodic treatment with anthelminthic medicines, to control STH infections.Historically, STH are highly transmitted in Pemba Island, Zanzibar. A 1994 survey in 12 schools estimated a STH prevalence of nearly 100%. Following this, PC was introduced but not regularly administered due to drug procurement issues. A 2011 survey in 24 schools estimated an STH prevalence of 89%. After this survey, PC was regularly administered until 2018. A 2021 survey found a prevalence of 80% (95% CI 78.1--81.5), with most cases due to T. trichiura. Over 32% of children had moderate or heavy intensity infections.Despite 25 years of PC in Pemba Island, STH prevalence and intensity remain high. This is due to irregular PC, climatic conditions favorable to STH transmission, low sensitivity of T. trichiura to benzimidazoles, high population density, and poor sanitation. Improving sanitation coverage is key to reducing STH prevalence and intensity. Possible changes to PC approaches include ensuring high coverage in all schools, using mebendazole instead of albendazole, and co-administering ivermectin with mebendazole.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne virus that has caused millions of infections worldwide. It belongs to the Togaviridae family and enters host cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After internalization, the virus moves through the cell and fuses with early endosomes, releasing its genetic material into the cell. A new study investigated the role of the microtubule network in the early steps of CHIKV infection.The study found that CHIKV particles move in two distinct patterns prior to fusion with early endosomes. Half of the particles remained static and fused in the cell periphery, while the other half moved rapidly along microtubules before fusing in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disrupting the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells, impaired the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol, and influenced the localization of membrane fusion. These findings suggest that microtubules may help the virus reach a location beneficial for establishing infection or uncoating.In summary, this study sheds light on the importance of microtubules in CHIKV infection, providing new insights into the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. Future studies can build on these findings to develop new antiviral strategies.
Bacteria use second messengers to respond to changing environmental conditions. One important second messenger is c-di-AMP, which is essential in many bacteria and can be toxic if it accumulates. C-di-AMP controls the expression and activity of certain proteins, including potassium transporters. In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, c-di-AMP binds to the potassium transporters KtrAB and KimA to limit the intracellular concentrations of potassium and osmotically compatible compounds to physiologically reasonable levels. In a study, researchers observed that a B. subtilis strain lacking all three diadenylate cyclases is unable to grow at potassium concentrations of 5 mM or higher or in the presence of glutamate. To understand the roles of glutamate and potassium as well as of c-di-AMP for global gene expression in B. subtilis, researchers performed extensive suppressor analysis of strains lacking c-di-AMP that had adapted to tolerate the presence of glutamate or that are viable on complex medium. These analyses revealed that the adaptation to either glutamate or complex medium usually requires the simultaneous presence of multiple suppressor mutations that often affect potassium uptake, osmolyte uptake, or glutamate metabolism. Moreover, a mechanosensitive channel and phospholipid biosynthesis play an important role in the sensitivity of a strain lacking c-di-AMP to glutamate. Strikingly, this study identified the amino acid transporter YbeC (renamed AimA, amino acid importer A) as the major glutamate transporter in B. subtilis. On complex medium, the c-di-AMP-binding signal transduction proteins DarA and DarB seem to be toxic in the absence of c-di-AMP, and only in their absence could isolate suppressor mutants. The results shed light on the complexicity of c-di-AMP essentiality and open new directions of research.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a type of virus that can cause certain types of cancer, such as lymphomas and epithelial cell cancers. EBV is prevalent in many people and is generally harmless, but in some cases it can cause diseases. In a study, researchers found that phase-amplitude coupling, a phenomenon where the phase of one wave of electrical activity in the brain is related to the amplitude of another wave, occurred in over 40% of brain activity recordings in people with EBV. This suggests that this phenomenon may be one way that the brain represents information. The study also found that the phase of the lower frequency activity at which the high frequency activity occurred was different for each of four image categories, providing support for the idea that not only how much neural firing occurs, but also when (or specifically, at what phase) it occurs, is important for how the brain represents information. Future studies could build on this analysis to see if phase-amplitude coupling also supports phase coding and neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.The text also discusses the role of Epstein-Barr virus in cancers and the immune system. Epstein-Barr virus is a virus that is causally linked to endemic Burkitt lymphoma in equatorial Africa and B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) in immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients, or individuals on immunomodulatory agents. LPD in these individuals can be a devastating complication. In the absence of T cell surveillance, EBV-infected B cells can proliferate rapidly, leading to LPD. Therapeutic approaches include reduction of immunosuppression, ablation of CD20+ B cells using Rituximab, adoptive T cell therapies, combination chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. While these improve survival and quality of life of LPD patients, reduction of immunosuppression can lead to damage or loss of transplanted organs, Rituximab causes global and often long-term B cell immunodeficiency, T cell therapies are not widely available, and chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapies are effective in selected cases, highlighting the need for additional strategies for prevention and treatment.The text also discusses the role of Epstein-Barr virus in DNA repair and cancer. EBV oncoproteins drive rapid cellular DNA replication, causing DNA forks to stall and sometimes collapse, resulting in activation of cellular ATR. EBV uses the cellular proto-oncogene STAT3 to block ATR’s ability to phosphorylate Chk1, ensuring that the intra-S phase checkpoint is sufficiently relaxed to allow transformed cells to progress through the cell cycle. With phospho-Chk1 also essential for key functions such as homologous recombination repair, particularly in cancer cells, blunted Chk1 phosphorylation impairs RAD51 nucleation, HR, and recovery following experimentally imposed DNA double-strand breaks. These HR-impaired proliferating cells now rely on error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) repair, resulting in susceptibility to PARP inhibition; PARP1 is known to be required for MMEJ-mediated repair. Importantly, the text also reports signatures of MMEJ-induced deletions as well as small and large insertions in the genomes of EBV-transformed human B lymphocytes. Furthermore, by analyzing gene expression profiles of cancer lines derived from a range of tissues, a STAT3-dependent gene set that is predictive of susceptibility to PARP inhibition of blood and other types of cancer is reported. These findings not only reveal how the tumor virus EBV re-shapes cellular DNA repair, but also provide the first genome-wide evidence for insertions resulting from MMEJ in human cells and expand the range of cancers (EBV-related and -unrelated) that are likely to respond to synthetic lethal inhibitors given the high prevalence of cancers with constitutively active STAT3.
Buruli ulcer is a chronic and debilitating disease affecting at least 33 tropical, subtropical, and temperate countries, with most cases in West and Central Africa. The exact mode of transmission is unclear, making prevention difficult. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimize morbidity, costs, and long-term disability. The gold standard for biological confirmation is the quantitative PCR targeting IS2404 of M. ulcerans performed on skin samples. In 2019, 11 laboratories formed BU-LABNET to combat the low PCR confirmation rate (under 30% in 2018) in endemic African countries. The network aimed to harmonize procedures, supply specific reagents, and implement quality control. After successful implementation, the network plans to integrate other neglected tropical diseases like yaws or leprosy into the platform. This effort highlights the importance of reliable diagnostic tools and collaboration in addressing neglected tropical diseases.
CD44 is a versatile protein involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation, hematopoiesis, cell migration, and cancer invasiveness. It consists of an ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The localization of CD44 into lipid rafts, microdomains in the cell membrane, can suppress the binding of the cytoplasmic tail to cytoskeleton adaptors, which act as regulators of cell motility and differentiation. The translocation of CD44 from non-raft to raft domains is driven by palmitoylations on cysteine residues. Specific lipids, such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2), also play a role in regulating the behavior of CD44. In model membranes, PIP2 resides in the disordered domain, but in living cells, its distribution is restricted to the nanoscale. Regardless of the exact location of PIP2 in the membrane, the association between CD44 and Ezrin is accelerated in its presence. The activation of the N-terminal domain of ERM protein, which is responsible for the membrane binding of the ERM, is induced by PIP2-binding, and the binding of FERM to membranes is strongly stabilized by even low concentrations of PIP2. These results suggest that PIP2 facilitates the association of CD44 and ERM by activating the FERM protein, supporting the association of FERM to the membrane surface and translocating both to the non-raft domain. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become a powerful alternative to study the interaction of membrane components in detail. In a CG MD study, the properties of CD44 in a phase-segregated model membrane with respect to its membrane distribution and FERM affinity were analyzed, and the results were tested against a more realistic plasma membrane model. The study found that the presence of PIP2 lipids allows CD44 and FERM to associate in an experimentally observed binding mode, while the highly palmitoylated species shows no binding affinity. These results shed light on the sophisticated mechanism on how membrane translocation and peripheral protein association can be controlled by both protein modifications and membrane composition.
In this research, the authors created a numerical model to understand how ant rafts, or groups of ants floating on water, maintain their shape and move. Ant rafts are made up of two layers: a structural layer of ants that form a solid base, and a freely active layer of ants that move around on top of the structural layer. The researchers were particularly interested in how the ants in the freely active layer move and interact to create tether-like protrusions that help the raft move and explore its environment.To study this, the researchers created a model that treats ants as discrete agents, or particles, that move according to certain rules. These rules include how the ants move, how they interact with each other, and how they transition between the structural and freely active layers. The model was then used to simulate the behavior of ant rafts and make predictions about how they move and change shape.The researchers found that the ants in the freely active layer move in a way that helps create protrusions, and that the activity level of these ants can cause the raft to change shape. They also found that the ants in the structural layer contract and expand in a way that helps maintain the overall shape of the raft. The researchers believe that these findings can help us understand how other collective living systems, such as swarms of robots or cells, can move and change shape in a coordinated way.
The text is a research paper about the study of mosquitoes, specifically Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens molestus. The researchers analyzed the genetic differences between these two subspecies, focusing on their olfactory genes. They used RNA sequencing and other genetic analysis techniques to compare the genetic material of the two subspecies. The researchers found that there are differences in the olfactory genes, specifically in the genes that code for odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and olfactory receptors (ORs), between the two subspecies. These differences in olfactory genes could be related to differences in the mosquitoes' behavior, such as their ability to find and feed on hosts. The researchers also found that some of the olfactory genes are specifically expressed in one subspecies and not the other, which could be related to differences in the mosquitoes' host preferences. The study provides new insights into the genetic basis of host preference in mosquitoes and could have implications for the development of new mosquito control strategies.In simpler terms, the researchers looked at the genetic material of two types of mosquitoes and found differences in the genes that help the mosquitoes smell and find hosts. They found that some of these smell-related genes are different between the two types of mosquitoes, and some genes are only present in one type but not the other. These differences in genes could be related to why the two types of mosquitoes prefer to feed on different animals.
This text is a summary of a medical research paper about the development of place fields in the brain. Place fields are areas in the brain that become active when an animal is in a certain location. The researchers built a computational model to describe how place fields form, stabilize, and change over time. They found that place fields are formed by a combination of somatic disinhibition, dendritic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity. Somatic disinhibition alone is enough to form place fields, but dendritic inhibition and synaptic plasticity are necessary for the place fields to stabilize. The researchers also found that the interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition balances the increased excitatory weights, allowing the place cells to return to their baseline firing rate after exploration. The researchers also used their model to predict how to perturb place fields, and they found that artificially inducing dendritic events can shift place fields even after they have stabilized. In conclusion, the researchers found that place field stability is due to large excitatory synaptic weights and large dendritic inhibition, and that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity.
Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) is a method used to detect the presence of Onchocerca volvulus DNA in black flies as an indicator for the presence of the parasite in human populations. A study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of MX for detecting onchocerciasis-positive communities and describe the characteristics of studies with reduced sensitivity. The study found that MX detected positive flies in every study area with mf prevalence greater than 1%, suggesting that MX is sensitive to communities with ongoing onchocerciasis transmission. However, further data is required to understand the relationship between MX rates and mf prevalence, particularly from MX surveys conducted earlier in control programs before transmission has been interrupted.
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. It affects the skin and nerves, and can lead to disfigurement and disability. The disease is more prevalent in Brazil and other tropical countries. The immune system's response to the bacteria plays a role in the severity of the disease. The study found that leprosy patients have lower levels of MASP-3 and MAp44 proteins, which are part of the immune system's complement pathway. These proteins help to fight off infections. The study also found that lepromatous patients, who have the most severe form of the disease, have even lower levels of these proteins. The study suggests that these low protein levels may contribute to the severity of the disease. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the role of these proteins in leprosy.
This text discusses the role of population size and glucose metabolism in evolution and genetic processes. It explains that nongenetic variation, or variation that occurs between individuals even when they have the same genome and environment, can affect the rate of adaptation. Nongenetic variation can either slow down or speed up adaptation. It can lower the fitness of a population, but it can also increase the rate of adaptation by smoothing the fitness landscape and making it easier for populations to climb to higher peaks. The text also discusses the role of proteins and gene expression in these processes. Proteins are important for many cell processes, including carbohydrate metabolism and cell metabolism. Gene expression is the process by which the instructions in DNA are used to build proteins. The text mentions transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate gene expression, and how they can be affected by nongenetic variation. Transcription factors can bind to DNA and either promote or repress the expression of certain genes. In this way, nongenetic variation can affect the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and cell metabolism, which can in turn affect the fitness of a population. The text also discusses the role of genetic drift, or random changes in the frequency of a gene variant in a population, in these processes. Genetic drift can cause transient random fitness differences between individuals, which can obscure genetic fitness differences and increase the effect of random genetic changes. Overall, the text suggests that nongenetic variation can have significant impacts on evolution and genetic processes.
Nucleic acids, proteins, and RNA-binding proteins all play a role in genetics and gene expression, particularly in relation to pathogens such as the dengue virus. The dengue virus is an RNA virus that infects humans and is transmitted through mosquitoes. The virus's RNA has a 3' untranslated region (UTR) that is involved in various RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that regulate the efficiency of infection, modulate host innate immune responses, and viral pathogenesis.A study was conducted to identify mosquito proteins that form complexes with the DENV RNA in mosquito cells using a technique called RaPID (RNA-Protein Interaction Detection). This technique allows for the identification of weak and transient RNA-protein interactions without the need for crosslinking. The study found that two mosquito proteins, Sec61A1 and Loqs, interact with DENV RNA. Sec61A1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein and has been shown to facilitate DENV replication. Loqs is a dsRNA-binding protein that interacts with the Dicer (Dcr) and Argonaute (Ago) proteins to regulate the RNAi pathway, a central immune defense mechanism in mosquito cells. However, the study found that Loqs interacts with the DENV genomic RNA and facilitates viral replication, independent of its role in the RNAi pathway.In infected mosquito cells, depletion of Sec61A1 or Loqs resulted in a significant reduction in DENV RNA abundances, indicating that both proteins have pro-viral functions. Northern blot analysis and western blot analysis also showed a reduction in DENV genomic RNA, sfRNA abundances, and DENV NS3 protein abundance upon depletion of Sec61A1/Loqs. Plaque assays also indicated a significant reduction in viral titer in both dsSec61A1 and dsLoqs-treated cells.These findings suggest that Sec61A1 and Loqs play a pro-viral role in the infectious cycle of DENV in mosquito cells. Similar results were observed in cells infected with a distinct strain of DENV2, indicating that the pro-viral functions of these proteins are not specific to one strain. Additionally, depletion of Sec61A1 or Loqs resulted in a significant reduction in YFV and ZIKV RNA abundances, while depletion of Loqs resulted in an increase in CHIKV RNA abundances.In conclusion, Sec61A1 and Loqs play a pro-viral role in the infectious cycle of several flaviviruses, but can also play antiviral roles. Loqs colocalizes with DENV RNAs with a significance that is comparable to that of DENV RNA-NS3 colocalization. Loqs specifically interacts with NS3 protein, which is essential for both viral RNA translation and replication, and is associated with membranes in infected cells. Loqs depletion doesn't affect the association of ribosomes with viral RNA or translation elongation, but it does reduce viral RNA translation and replication. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between viral RNA and host proteins in order to develop effective antiviral strategies.
Lay Summary:Conservation biology and ecology involve studying the impact of temporal environmental variations on biodiversity. In particular, the covariance between competition and environment can facilitate invasions of rare species via the storage effect. This study quantitatively examines the effects of temporal variations in two-species and diverse communities, comparing scenarios with periodic or stochastic environmental variations and global or local competition. The number of temporal niches plays a crucial role in diverse communities, affecting species richness and evenness. When the number of temporal niches is large, storage effect and periodic variations increase both species richness and evenness. However, when the number of temporal niches is small, global competition decreases species richness and evenness by focusing competition to specific periods, thus increasing effective fitness differences.
Functional non-coding RNAs, or fncRNAs, are nucleotide sequences that significantly influence gene expression and translation, genome stability, and human health and disease. To understand the determinants of function in these molecules, a study used the Evolutionary Trace (ET) method to analyze 1070 functional RNAs, including the ribosome. The ET method correlates sequence variations with evolutionary divergences to rank sequence positions as more or less important to function. The study found that the top-ranked bases, or ET bases, clustered in secondary and tertiary structures and mapped to functional regions for catalysis, binding proteins and drugs, post-transcriptional modification, and deleterious mutations. Furthermore, the quantitative quality of these clusters correlated with the identification of functional regions. Therefore, phylogenetic analysis can broadly identify functional determinants in RNA sequences and functional sites in RNA structures, and reveal details on the basis of RNA molecular functions. This work is relevant to studies of structure-function in ribonucleic acids and shows that evolutionary constraints among sequence, structure, and function are similar in structured RNA and proteins. The ET method is currently available as part of the ET command-line package and will be available as a web-server.
The text discusses a method for detecting the source of epidemics, specifically focusing on cholera outbreaks. The method is based on network analysis and probability theory, using a sensor-based approach and a stochastic differential equation model for water-borne disease. The authors propose to recast the source detection problem as one of identifying the relevant mixture component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. Human mobility networks are incorporated into the model, as they play a crucial role in the spreading of infectious diseases, including waterborne diseases. The method is demonstrated to improve source detection in the context of the 2000-2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.In simpler terms, the researchers have developed a new way to find the starting point of a cholera outbreak by using a combination of network analysis, probability theory, and information about how people move around. They tested this method using data from a cholera outbreak in South Africa and found that it was effective in identifying the source of the outbreak. This approach could help improve the response to cholera and other infectious diseases by allowing for faster and more accurate identification of the source of an outbreak.
Researchers have developed advanced imaging techniques that allow for detailed examination of cancer tissues by staining them with multiple markers. However, these techniques have limitations such as the need for specific expertise, long imaging acquisition time, and tissue loss. To address these issues, this study proposes computational methods to determine the amount of shared information between markers and select an optimally reduced panel for multiplex imaging. The researchers used breast cancer tissue microarray datasets and cyclic immunofluorescence as a proof of concept. They found that it is possible to design more efficient multiplex imaging panels that maximize the amount of information retained with the limited number of markers. The proposed methods can help researchers choose the most informative markers for their studies, which can lead to better understanding of cancer biology and improved clinical management.
Leptospirosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira. It can affect both humans and animals, particularly rodents. The bacteria is transmitted through urine from infected animals and can cause a wide range of symptoms, from mild flu-like symptoms to severe illness and even death. A study was conducted to understand the relationship between leptospirosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) using a hamster model. Hamsters were infected with Leptospira interrogans serovar Manilae strain UP-MMC-SM. The results showed that subcutaneous infection with the bacteria could lead to acute death or chronic leptospirosis in hamsters. In the chronic phase, 13 out of 15 hamsters that survived the acute phase had Leptospira colonization in their kidneys. The degree of atrophic tubules in kidney sections correlated statistically with the serum creatinine level in the chronic phase, suggesting that the renal distribution of leptospires during the acute phase may affect the extent of tubular atrophy, leading to CKD.In conclusion, this study provides evidence that leptospirosis can lead to chronic kidney disease in hamsters, and suggests that the renal distribution of leptospires during the acute phase of the disease may play a role in the development of CKD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in humans.
Talaromycosis is a serious regional disease endemic in Southeast Asia, with high morbidity and mortality rates in HIV/AIDS patients in China, particularly in Guangxi. The disease is caused by the fungus Talaromyces marneffei, which infects various tissues and organs, leading to a fatal disseminated fungal infection. The average in-hospital mortality rate of HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei infection was 13.3% from 2012 to 2019. The most common complications/coinfections were pneumonia, oral candida, and tuberculosis. Deceased patients showed higher levels of certain indicators, such as CD4/CD8 ratios, AST, creatinine, urea, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, and lower levels of CD3+ T-cell count, CD8+ T-cell count, and lymphocyte counts, platelet, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hemoglobin compared to surviving patients.The XGBoost machine learning model was found to be a good predictor of hospitalization outcome for HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei infection, and it may have potential application in mortality prediction and high-risk factor identification in the talaromycosis population. Septic shock and respiratory failure were the most important predictive features in the XGBoost model.
Toxocara, a type of parasitic roundworm, is a common parasite in pets and can cause a disease called toxocariasis in humans. This disease is often underdiagnosed and understudied, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in the United States. A recent study found that Toxocara eggs are widespread in public spaces in New York City, with the Bronx having the highest contamination rate. The study also found that Toxocara cati, the cat roundworm, was the predominant species. These findings suggest that feral or untreated cats in New York City represent a significant source of environmental contamination and that human toxocariasis has emerged as an important health disparity in the city. It is important to reduce environmental Toxocara contamination and explore further public health interventions to interrupt transmission to humans.Toxocara eggs are commonly found in the sand and soil of play areas in New York City, particularly in poorer neighborhoods. The predominant species of Toxocara in the city appears to be T. cati. Preventive measures should be taken to reduce the risk of toxocariasis, including improved fencing of play areas to prevent feral cat entry, deworming of domestic pets, better control of stray cats and dogs, picking up feces of pets, avoiding consumption of contaminated food, restriction of children with pica from play areas, and frequent handwashing after visiting play areas. It is important to address this health disparity and protect the health of children and pets in New York City.
Scorpions in the genus Tityus, particularly Tityus trivittatus, are a public health issue in tropical America, including parts of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. A recent study focused on a population of T. trivittatus found in urban areas of eastern Paraguay, where it has caused severe envenomation in children. The study analyzed the lethality, composition, antigenicity, and enzymatic activity of the venom from this Paraguayan population.The venom was found to be highly lethal, with an LD50 (median lethal dose) of approximately 1.19 mg/kg. Venom neutralization was only partially effective using an Argentinean anti-T. trivittatus antivenom, but was completely effective using a Brazilian anti-T. serrulatus antivenom. This suggests antigenic differences between the Paraguayan population and the Argentinean and Brazilian populations.Further analysis using venom competitive solid-phase enzyme immunoassays and immunoblotting confirmed the presence of antigenic differences between the Argentinean and Paraguayan populations. SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed variations in the type and relative amounts of venom proteins between the two populations. Additionally, proteolytic activity and peptide identification through nESI-MS/MS suggest the presence of population-specific proteases, which may be involved in the envenoming process.A molecular phylogeny of mitochondrial COI sequences showed a significant (8.14%) genetic differentiation between the Argentinean and Paraguayan populations, indicating they may correspond to distinct, unique cryptic species.In summary, the study found significant toxinological and genetic divergence between a Paraguayan population of T. trivittatus and populations from Argentina, indicating they may be unique cryptic species. These findings suggest that further venom and taxonomic diversity exists in southern South American Tityus than previously thought, which has implications for the development of antivenoms and the understanding of the envenoming process.
Bat-pollinated flowers have unique acoustic properties that differ from flowers pollinated by insects or birds. These acoustic properties are likely used by bats for identification and classification of flowers. A deep learning classifier was trained with echo spectrograms of flowers and was able to distinguish between bat-pollinated flowers and those pollinated by insects or birds with high accuracy. The classifier performed better when trained with echoes sampled randomly, compared to interval sampling. The network's convergence depends on the amount of inputs and takes longer the more inputs are processed simultaneously. Nectarivorous and frugivorous bats emit echolocation signals at a rate of 15 ± 5 calls per second, which increases up to 32 ± 11 calls per second when approaching a target. During behavioral experiments, repetition rate increases to up to 51 calls per second. Bats are able to deduce many aspects of the impulse response from the echoes and can use highly resolved temporal information. Bats can clearly perceive spectral echo information and use both spectral and temporal information. Spectral echo sequences acquired from different directions are particularly informative, and even single flower echoes or small sequences contain species-specific information. After removing effects of flower surface area, bat-pollinated flowers have a higher overall target strength than flowers pollinated by insects or birds. This increased target strength will increase echo acoustic detection distance. The stiff and waxy surfaces of many bat-pollinated flowers might be an adaptation to increase density and thereby their acoustic impedance, leading to a greater magnitude of the reflected echo. Bat-pollinated flowers show less variance in their morphological features than entomophilous or ornithophilous flowers. A high morphological variance is directly related to higher acoustic variance.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease affecting millions of people worldwide, with China being one of the endemic areas. The disease is caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma, with Oncomelania hupensis being the sole intermediate snail host in China. Snail control is crucial in eliminating schistosomiasis, but traditional methods such as manual snail collection are labor-intensive and not always accurate. Remote sensing using satellite imagery has been used to identify snail habitats, but its accuracy is limited by the resolution of optical sensors. Therefore, a study was conducted to improve identification by using machine-learning algorithms.The study was conducted in Anhui Province in eastern China, one of the most important areas endemic for schistosomiasis. The study aimed to predict the potential snail habitats of the two types of snail habitats, i.e., lake/marshlands and hilly/mountainous areas, by using machine-learning algorithms. Thirty-six environmental variables were considered, including remotely sensed data such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), elevation data (DEM), distance to nearest water body, climatic variables, geomorphic type, land use type, ecosystem type, and vegetation type.The study found that the presence/absence models outperformed the presence-only models, particularly those based on machine-learning algorithms such as RF, SVM, and ANN. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm performed best, giving an AUC of 0.988 and 0.985 for the two types of snail habitats. The distance to the nearest river was the most important variable for predicting the potential snail habitats in the lake/marshlands, while the mean temperature of the driest quarter (Bio9) and annual precipitation (Bio12) were the most important variables for the hilly/mountainous areas. The final risk maps for the potential snail habitats showed that the potentially positive areas of snail habitats for the lake/marshland area are mainly along the Yangtze River, while those of the hilly/mountainous areas were more dispersed and mostly distributed in the areas south of the Yangtze River.In conclusion, the study found that machine-learning algorithms, particularly RF, were effective in predicting the potential snail habitats of two types of snail habitats. The prediction maps of potential snail habitats should be valuable for directing local staff to conduct precise snail investigations, improving the efficiency and accuracy of monitoring snail habitats. The study highlights the importance of using highly accurate modelling techniques in mapping amphibious snails, which can potentially be dispersed over a much wider area.
Giardia duodenalis, a protozoan parasite, causes giardiasis, a diarrheal disease that affects humans and other mammals. The treatment of giardiasis mainly relies on metronidazole (MTZ) and albendazole (ABZ). However, the emergence of ABZ resistance in this parasite has prompted studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. G. duodenalis trophozoites convert ABZ into its sulfoxide (ABZSO) and sulfone (ABZSOO) forms, but the enzyme responsible for this metabolism is not yet identified. This study aimed to identify the enzyme responsible for ABZ metabolism and its role in ABZ resistance in G. duodenalis. The study found that the iron-containing cofactor heme induces higher mRNA expression levels of flavohemoglobin (gFlHb) in Giardia trophozoites. Molecular docking analyses predict favorable interactions of gFlHb with ABZ, ABZSO, and ABZSOO. Spectral analyses of recombinant gFlHb in the presence of ABZ, ABZSO, and ABZSOO showed high affinities for each of these compounds. ABZ and ABZSO enhanced gFlHb NADH oxidase activity, whereas LC-MS/MS analyses of the reaction products showed that gFlHb slowly oxygenates ABZ into ABZSO at a much lower rate. Furthermore, gFlHb mRNA expression is lower in albendazole-resistant clones compared to those that are sensitive to this drug. Additionally, all albendazole-resistant clones transfected to overexpress gFlHb displayed higher susceptibility to the drug than the parent clones. These findings indicate a role for gFlHb in ABZ conversion to its sulfoxide and that gFlHb down-regulation acts as a passive pharmacokinetic mechanism of resistance in this parasite.
Sulfur is an essential element for all life forms, and its utilization is a fundamental process across different domains of life. However, how cells deal with varying sulfur availability is not well understood. A study focused on yeast, a key model organism, found that even when a key enzyme in the sulfur assimilation process, homocysteine synthase (Met17p), is deleted, cells can still grow under specific conditions. This growth phenotype is not heritable and is not due to amino acid contaminations in the growth medium. Instead, it is suggested that cells overcome the auxotrophy through a metabolic bypass involving an uncharacterized protein, Hsu1p. Hsu1p encodes a metabolic enzyme that directly assimilates sulfur from hydrogen sulfide, enabling cell growth and resolving methionine auxotrophy once critical concentrations of sulfide are leaked from met17Δ cells. This discovery indicates that cells can cooperate to achieve sulfur fixation, highlighting the collective properties of microbial communities that facilitate their basic metabolic capacity to overcome sulfur limitation.
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a crucial hormone that stimulates insect egg production by regulating vitellogenesis, a process involving the synthesis, secretion, and transport of yolk proteins. A study on the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, used this insect as a model to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of JH-induced vitellogenesis. The researchers found that JH triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the phosphorylation of Partitioning defective protein 3 (Par3) via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), small GTPase Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and atypical Protein kinase C (aPKC). This phosphorylation causes Par3 to disassociate from β-Catenin, leading to the disassembly of zonula adherens (ZA), a belt-like adherens junction that maintains physical linking between follicle cells. This ZA disassembly results in the enlargement of patency, intercellular channels in the follicular epithelium, allowing for vitellogenin transport.The study provides new insights into how JH stimulates insect vitellogenesis and egg production by inducing the opening of the paracellular route for vitellogenin transport across the follicular epithelium barrier. The findings also suggest that the mechanisms underlying patency opening are conserved across different insect species and could potentially be targeted for pest control.In simpler terms, JH is a hormone that controls egg production in insects. The study found that JH triggers a signaling pathway that leads to the opening of intercellular channels (patency) in the follicular epithelium, allowing for the transport of yolk proteins. This opening of patency is crucial for egg production and occurs through the disassembly of zonula adherens (ZA), a component of the cell-cell junction. The study used the migratory locust as a model organism and found that the mechanisms underlying patency opening are conserved across different insect species. These findings could potentially be used for pest control by targeting the pathway involved in patency opening.
Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver-related deaths, with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) being the most common form of ALD in registry data. ALC patients have a strong over-representation of diagnoses associated with liver complications such as ascites and esophageal varices. ALD can be predicted by a set of comorbidities, some of which could be general predictors of ALD, including alcohol-overuse, under/mal-nutrition, liver dysfunction, trauma and lifestyle, and upper intestinal or respiratory mucosal diseases. The Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) was used to study ALD, and it contains data on all public and private hospital admissions in Denmark from 1994-2014. The registry contains administrative information, primary and secondary diagnoses coded according to ICD-10, and operations performed over all hospitals in Denmark. The NPR dataset comprises diagnoses covering the entire population of Denmark during ∼ 19 years (1996-2014) and contains ∼ 101 million unique assignments of primary and secondary diagnoses. A case-control study was performed using the sets of patients with ALC, ALF, and their matched non-ALD controls. Five main groups of comorbid diagnoses were discovered that relate to: (i) alcohol-overuse as disorder behavior or diseases of pancreas, (ii) under/mal-nutrition as anemia, (iii) liver dysfunction as ascites, (iv) trauma and lifestyle as fracture or type 2 diabetes, and (v) upper intestinal or respiratory mucosal diseases as gastric ulcer or hemorrhage from respiratory passages. These comorbidities could be general predictors of ALD.
In the field of developmental neuroscience, researchers are studying how neurons in the brain change and adapt over time. One important aspect of this is how neurons alter their dendrite arbors, which are the branching extensions of nerve cells that receive signals from other neurons. This process of dendrite remodeling involves the elimination and regeneration of dendritic branches. A research paper in this field used the Drosophila fruit fly as a model organism to study the intrinsic mechanisms underlying dendrite regeneration.The researchers focused on a type of sensory neuron in Drosophila called class IV dendrite arborization (C4da) neurons. These neurons undergo both developmentally programmed and damage-induced dendrite regeneration, making them a useful model for studying dendrite remodeling. The researchers found that a microRNA called miR-87 is a critical regulator of dendrite regeneration in these neurons.In Drosophila, miR-87 is involved in dendrite regeneration after developmentally-programmed pruning and after acute injury. Specifically, miR-87 promotes dendrite regrowth during regeneration at least in part through suppressing the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack69 (Ttk69). This suggests that developmental and injury-induced dendrite regeneration share a common intrinsic mechanism to reactivate dendrite growth.In addition, the researchers found that the timing of dendrite regeneration is controlled by miRNAs, which are short non-coding RNAs that inhibit the expression of target mRNAs. In the case of C4da neurons, miR-87 activity is increased during the larva-to-pupa transition, in anticipation of miR-87 function in dendrite regrowth. Overexpression of miR-87 leads to precocious dendrite outgrowth following pruning, demonstrating that miR-87 overexpression specifically regulates the timing of early stages of regrowth.Overall, this research highlights the importance of miRNAs, and specifically miR-87, in the regulation of dendrite regeneration in Drosophila. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite regeneration in fruit flies may provide insight into the regulation of dendrite growth and regeneration in higher organisms, including humans.
Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are a type of white blood cell that can quickly respond to malaria parasites without the need for prior exposure or processing. These cells can inhibit the replication of the parasites and are associated with protection from malaria. However, frequent malaria infections can cause these cells to decline in number and effectiveness, and to start expressing a protein called CD16. This study looks at the role of CD16 in the immune response to malaria. The researchers found that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells with CD16 have more cytolytic potential, meaning they are better at destroying infected cells, and have traits similar to mature natural killer (NK) cells. These CD16-positive cells are able to respond to opsonized parasite antigens, or parasites that have been coated with antibodies, through CD16 in a way that is independent of the T cell receptor. This represents a new role for both Vγ9Vδ2 T cells and opsonizing antibodies in parasite clearance, highlighting the cooperation between the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system.
DEER-PREdict is a new software program that predicts Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) distance distributions and Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) rates from ensembles of protein conformations. It uses a rotamer library approach to describe the paramagnetic probes which are bound to the protein. The software is designed to operate efficiently on large conformational ensembles, such as those generated by molecular dynamics simulation, to help validate or refine molecular models and interpret experimental data. DEER-PREdict has been tested on several experimentally characterized protein systems, including HIV-1 protease, T4 Lysozyme, and Acyl-CoA-binding protein, and has been shown to be accurate and efficient. The software is open source and available for use.
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a significant cause of diarrhea in children under five in low-middle income countries (LMICs), but the lack of diagnostic tools results in limited data on its burden and epidemiology. A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of a new Rapid LAMP based Diagnostic Test (RLDT) for ETEC detection in stool samples from Zambian children. The study found that the RLDT was sufficiently sensitive and specific, and easy to implement in endemic countries. It is rapid and simple, making it an attractive tool for point-of-care testing in resource-limited settings. The overall prevalence of ETEC was 19.8% by qPCR and 19.4% by RLDT, with the highest prevalence in children between 12 to 59 months. The RLDT detected ETEC directly from stool in less than an hour. The study suggests that the RLDT could be used in a field setting to rapidly detect ETEC among patients presenting with diarrhea in health facilities in endemic countries. The LT-ETEC and ST-ETEC strains were highly prevalent, and ETEC positivity was highest in the warm rainy season. The RLDT performed comparably to the qPCR assay, with high specificity and sensitivity, suggesting that it could be used in a field setting to rapidly detect ETEC.
Researchers have developed a new method for analyzing data from longitudinal studies, which are experiments that take place over a period of time with repeated measurements. This new method, called Repeated Measures ASCA+ (RM-ASCA+), is designed to handle the complexities of such studies, which can include unbalanced designs, randomized interventions, and missing data. The method combines statistical techniques with principal component analysis to separate and visualize the effects of different experimental factors. This approach can help researchers interpret data from longitudinal clinical trials with multiple outcomes more easily. The method was tested using two datasets from metabolomics studies, one involving breast cancer patients and the other involving patients who had undergone bariatric surgery. The researchers found that RM-ASCA+ was able to effectively analyze the data and reveal trends that were not immediately apparent. The method is flexible and can be adapted to different coding systems and the inclusion of covariates, making it well-suited for clinical trials with multiple outcomes.
This text discusses a model for disease diagnosis that uses a reaction network to represent the time evolution of disease states. The authors use a stochastic process to simulate the development of defects in the reaction network over time, which can help identify the optimal time for medical intervention. The model is based on the idea that a disease state is a macroscopic state of the sign probability distribution, which can change smoothly or discontinuously depending on the dynamics of the system.The authors use a reaction network to define the microscopic variables or signs/symptoms, with the value of an observed sign revealing the number or concentration of a biochemical species. The diseases or disease phenotypes are defined as the macroscopic or emergent behaviors displayed by the sign variables. A defect in the reaction network is defined as a specific deviation in the reaction rates of the healthy network.The authors introduce an effective dynamics for temporal evolution of diseases, inspired by thermal annealing of physical systems. They apply this to a specific model of microscopic signs to study disease development and its consequences for disease diagnosis in different stages of the process.The paper also discusses the potential use of a reaction network as a specific microscopic model to provide clear definitions for signs, symptoms, and diseases, and to study disease-disease interactions. The authors use synthetic data generated by a dynamical model to investigate the time dependence of the diagnostic performance with a simple probabilistic model of signs and diseases.Overall, the authors present a stochastic model using the reverse annealing algorithm for the simulation of disease evolution in time, with the goal of improving the accuracy of diagnosis as the system performance degrades in the presence of defects. The use of a reaction network as a specific microscopic model provides clear definitions for signs, symptoms, and diseases, and allows for the explicit modeling of disease-disease interactions.
Lay Summary:The transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is dependent on the amount of infectious particles present in the environment and the proximity between the susceptible and infectious host. This study aimed to determine the relationship between viral kinetics in the upper respiratory tract and viral kinetics in the aerosols, and their impact on new transmissions. The study used a mathematical model to analyze the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in golden hamsters. The results showed that infectious virus shedding early in infection correlates with transmission events, shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection, and high viral RNA levels late in the infection are a poor indicator of transmission. The study also found that viral infectiousness increases in a density dependent manner with viral RNA, and their relative ratio is time-dependent. Such information is useful for designing interventions.
Lay Summary:This text discusses methods for estimating the overlap between two communities, such as groups of species or genes, when only partial samples are available. Traditional methods have assumed knowledge of total community sizes, but this paper addresses communities of unknown size. It uses Bayesian methods to produce unbiased estimates of the overlap between two stochastically sampled communities, and introduces a model for β-diversity calculations which produces joint estimates of the number of shared species or genes, the sizes of each community, and the degree of overlap between them. The paper focuses on estimating the genetic similarity between pairs of malaria parasites from the species Plasmodium falciparum, which is the most virulent of the human malaria parasites. The methods are based on the presence or absence of specific gene sequences, and the total number of independent samples taken from each community. By using these methods, the paper aims to estimate the number of shared genes and the sizes of each group of parasites, which can help in understanding the transmission and evolution of malaria.
Chagas Disease (CD) is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is common in Latin America and has become a global health issue due to international migration. The disease has two phases: acute and chronic. The acute phase is usually asymptomatic or manifests as a self-limiting fever, while the chronic phase is often asymptomatic but can lead to cardiomyopathies and death in 30% of cases. Diagnosing T. cruzi infection is essential to prevent disease progression and transmission. However, diagnosis is complex due to the lack of reference standards, multiple types of assays with different sensitivity and specificity, and the difficulty of detecting the parasite in the chronic phase. The World Health Organization recommends using two conventional tests based on different principles and antigen detection. Serological tests such as ELISA and RDTs are commonly used. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ELISA tests had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 98%, while RDTs had values of 95% and 97%, respectively. The study suggests that ELISA and RDT tests have high validity for diagnosing chronic Chagas disease. However, limitations include difficulties in data extraction due to insufficient information in articles and the comparative clinical-type design of some studies.
Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that affects various cognitive functions and behavioral traits. It exists in two forms, phasic and tonic DA, which have distinct functions and are associated with different spiking patterns of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Phasic DA is related to a teaching signal, while tonic DA is associated with motivational drive. DA transmission, the process that shapes the DA signal, involves both synaptic and volume transmission. Synaptic transmission describes precise signaling between two cells, while volume transmission refers to communication between neurons beyond the synaptic cleft. The presence of extra-synaptic DA receptors and non-synaptic terminals supports the occurrence of volume transmission. However, the impact of DA diffusion from synaptic terminals and its role in DA transmission is not fully understood. A new computational model for DA transmission has been developed, which incorporates the specific geometry of synapses and uses a full numerical approach with the method of finite elements. This model examines how strongly DAT uptake acts near a synaptic cleft and the potential effect on DA-type2-receptors (D2R). It also compares simulations of increased DA release and of uptake inhibition to a default simulation and focuses on temporal and spatial variability in extra-synaptic space. This model enables the discussion of both slow and fast binding of D2R.The model suggests that synaptic DA transmission targets precise input-output representations, while volume transmission produces a more global signal. Synaptic transmission may be of particular importance for understanding the role of DA where striatal DA synapses occur interrelated with synapses from limbic and cortical inputs. Empirical studies suggest that the synaptic micro-environment needs special consideration. Cell recordings in mice midbrain slices concluded that synaptic DA transmission does not depend on volume transmission and that uptake is a critical factor controlling shape and duration of inhibitory post-synaptic currents. Similar results were recently reported in striatal interneurons and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) using optical methods. In conclusion, the new computational model for DA transmission provides a better understanding of the role of DA in cognitive functions and behavioral traits. It highlights the importance of synaptic DA transmission and the impact of DA uptake on post-synaptic cell excitability. The model enables the discussion of both slow and fast binding of D2R and bridges apparent discrepancies from empirical observation across methods.
The research focuses on the degeneration of tick salivary glands, which occurs rapidly after the tick finishes feeding. This degeneration is caused by a combination of autophagy and apoptosis. The study found that ecdysone, a hormone found in ticks, plays a role in this process. High concentrations of ecdysone led to the cleavage of a protein called RhATG5, which promotes the transition from autophagy to apoptosis. This process is regulated by calcium concentration and the expression of certain genes. The study also used various techniques such as RNA extraction, qRT-PCR, and western blots to confirm their findings. In summary, the degeneration of tick salivary glands is a complex process that involves both autophagy and apoptosis, and is regulated by ecdysone and calcium concentration.
Yellow fever (YF) has seen significant changes in its incidence and geographic extent over the past 20 years, with the largest outbreaks in South America since 1940 occurring in the previously unaffected South-East Atlantic coast of Brazil in 2016-2019. The study aimed to examine the role of vegetation, land-cover, climate, and host population in predicting the numbers of months a location reported YF per year and by each month over the time-period. Two sets of models were assessed, one looking at interannual differences over the study period (2003-2016), and a seasonal model looking at intra-annual differences by month, averaging over the years of the study period. Each model was fit using hierarchical negative-binomial regression in an exhaustive model fitting process. The best performing models, as measured by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), were combined to create ensemble models to describe interannual and seasonal variation in YF. The models reproduced the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in YF transmission with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.43 (95% CI 0.41--0.45) for the interannual model and 0.66 (95% CI 0.64--0.67) for the seasonal model. The models explain much of the spatiotemporal variation in YF in South America, both seasonally and across the period 2003-2016. Vegetation type (EVI), heterogeneity in vegetation (perhaps a proxy for habitat fragmentation), and land cover explain much of the trends in YF transmission seen. These findings may help understand the recent expansions of the YF endemic zone, as well as the highly seasonal nature of YF.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a condition characterized by uncontrollable, repetitive actions and thoughts. These actions and thoughts are believed to be caused by abnormalities in fundamental learning systems. A study was conducted to investigate the role of Pavlovian cues in instrumental behavior in both clinical OCD patients and healthy controls. The study used a Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task, which includes instrumental training, Pavlovian training, and a PIT phase. In the instrumental training stage, participants learn to perform certain actions to earn rewards or avoid punishments. In the Pavlovian training stage, participants learn the association between Pavlovian cues and rewards or punishments. In the PIT phase, participants perform the instrumental task in the presence of both instrumental and Pavlovian cues.The study found that OCD patients had a weaker Pavlovian influence on instrumental behavior than healthy controls, especially for negative Pavlovian cues. This contrasts with the increased PIT effects reported for other disorders characterized by compulsivity, such as substance use disorders. The authors suggest that this reduced PIT in OCD may be due to an impairment in using the contextual information provided by the cues to adjust behavior, especially when inhibiting responding when a negative cue is present. This study provides insight into the deficits in OCD from the perspective of Pavlovian influences on instrumental behavior and may have implications for OCD treatment modalities focused on reducing compulsive behaviors.
The review discusses the biosynthesis of pantothenate (Pan) and coenzyme A (CoA) in apicomplexan parasites, with a focus on Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum. Pan is an essential precursor for the synthesis of CoA, which is a cofactor for various cellular functions in all living cells. In T. gondii, Pan synthesis occurs in two stages: the first two transformations are catalyzed by a bifunctional KPHMT-KPR enzyme, while the third transformation is catalyzed by pantoate-beta-alanine ligase (PBAL). Recent studies have shown that the enzymes involved in Pan synthesis localize to the mitochondrion and nucleus, respectively. However, T. gondii tachyzoites, the rapidly dividing stage of the parasite, do not synthesize Pan but rather scavenge it from the host. In contrast, bradyzoites, the slow-growing, encysted stage of the parasite, retain the ability to synthesize Pan. Mining of the Toxoplasma genome has failed to identify homologous enzymes for synthesizing β-alanine via the various routes known in mammalian, bacterial, or yeast systems. T. gondii tachyzoites are dependent on exogenous β-alanine to produce Pan and PBAL activity could only be identified upon supplementation with both pantoate and β-alanine. The review also discusses the potential of pantothenamides (PanAms), a class of Pan analogs, as antimalarial preclinical development. The potential of PanAs to target multiple downstream pathways make them a promising compound class as broad antiparasitic drugs against other apicomplexans. The review concludes by summarizing the recent advances in understanding the Pan and CoA biosynthesis pathways and their suitability as drug targets in Apicomplexa, with a particular focus on the cyst-forming coccidian, Toxoplasma gondii, and the haemosporidian, Plasmodium falciparum.
Membrane proteins have unique traits, with many of their hydrophobic amino acids exposed to the lipid bilayers rather than being embedded in the protein interior. This is often not explicitly considered in protein structure and function predictions. A new predictive quantity, Membrane Contact Probability (MCP), has been proposed to describe the likelihood of amino acids being in direct contact with lipid molecules. MCP can be predicted for any given sequence using a machine learning-based method and a training dataset extracted from MemProtMD, a database generated from molecular dynamics simulations for membrane proteins. MCP can improve the precision of protein contact maps and structures, particularly for membrane proteins. Membrane proteins are important as they are responsible for substance transport and signal transduction across cell membranes, and over 50% of known drugs target them. However, the structural prediction of membrane proteins is challenging due to the limited number of known structures compared to the number of sequences encoding into membrane proteins. Recent developments in deep learning have improved protein structure prediction accuracy, but researchers have mostly focused on soluble proteins, which are easier for structural determination. Therefore, there is a need to explicitly consider and utilize the membrane-contacting feature of membrane proteins in structure and function studies.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major global challenge, and managing it requires the use of simulation models to predict and control the spread of the disease. A new study has developed a detailed agent-based simulation model, called PanSim, to test different control measures in a city-sized societal environment. The model can handle complex scenarios and subgroups, and it can capture finer details of epidemic development, such as individual contacts between agents in specific locations and times.The study found that vaccination strategies prioritizing occupational risk groups minimize the number of infections but allow higher mortality. Prioritizing vulnerable groups minimizes mortality but implies an increased infection rate. Intensive vaccination along with non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially suppress the spread of the virus, while low levels of vaccination and premature reopening can easily revert the epidemic to an uncontrolled state.The model also highlights the benefits and limitations of various quarantine and testing scenarios. For example, it shows that extensive testing followed by quarantining can repress the pandemic with a moderately infective virus, but it is not enough to stop the pandemic of a highly transmissible and more harmful variant.The study also analyzed different vaccination orders and found that varying the vaccination order has a lower impact than increasing the vaccination intensity. Curfew and lockdown of social event sites, restaurants, and pubs are crucial strategies to control pandemics by decreasing the number of interactions between individuals. However, reopening too early can lead to the collapse of the healthcare system and increase total death cases.In summary, the study's findings can help decision-makers plan and schedule effective interventions such as vaccination policies and safe reopening schemes. The detailed spatio-temporal resolution of PanSim allows the design and testing of complex, specifically targeted interventions with a large number of agents under dynamically changing conditions.
Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a poorly understood condition that affects children in low- and middle-income countries and is associated with undernutrition and stunted growth. Its etiology is elusive, but it is believed to be caused by environmental factors that trigger small bowel damage. A new study describes the development of a histology index for EED, which is a scoring system for interpreting duodenal biopsies. This index could be useful in understanding and diagnosing this disorder.The study was based on duodenal endoscopic biopsies from children in two cohorts where EED is prevalent (Pakistan and Zambia), as well as North American children with and without gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE). The biopsies were processed for routine staining and scanned to produce whole slide images, which were then evaluated by three gastrointestinal pathologists. A semi-quantitative scoring index composed of 11 parameters was constructed, and the pathologists used this index to read the whole slide images. Inter-observer reliability was assessed, and the index was found to be useful in identifying features common across and unique to each cohort.Histology index features included tissue injury and response patterns commonly observed in routine clinical practice. Eight of the 11 histologic scoring parameters showed useful degrees of variation. The overall concordance across all parameters was 96% weighted agreement, kappa 0.70, and Gwet’s AC 0.93. Zambian and Pakistani tissues shared some histologic features with GSE, but most features were distinct, particularly the abundance of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the Pakistani cohort and marked villous destruction and loss of secretory cell lineages in the Zambian cohort.The study proposes the first EED histology index for interpreting duodenal biopsies. This index should be useful in future clinical and translational studies of this widespread, poorly understood, and highly consequential disorder. The index might help identify histopathologic features unique to EED as well as those shared with other enteropathies or identify histologically-identifiable subsets of EED. This could ultimately improve our understanding of the histopathology underlying this entity or entities and lead to better diagnosis and treatment for children affected by this condition.
Transparent games are a new game-theoretic setting where players can observe each other's actions with a certain probability. This is different from classical game theory, where players either act simultaneously without knowing each other’s choices or sequentially with some players having more information than others. Transparent games provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints. Evolutionary simulations show that even a small probability of seeing the partner’s choice before deciding on one’s own action substantially changes the evolutionary successful strategies in iterated coordination games and the Prisoner’s Dilemma. In the iterated coordination game, “Win-stay, lose-shift” and “Tit-for-tat” strategies are predominant for moderate transparency, while a “Leader-Follower” strategy emerges for high transparency. These results have implications for studies of human and animal social behavior, especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions.
This research paper discusses the role of ATRX in the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway, which is a recombination-based mechanism for maintaining telomere length in some cancers. The researchers demonstrate that the loss of ATRX, combined with telomere dysfunction during crisis, is sufficient to initiate activation of the ALT pathway and confer replicative immortality in human fibroblasts. They also show that loss of ATRX in epithelial cancer cells leads to a transient activation of ALT, but ultimately the telomeres continue to erode. The researchers also found that all alleles, regardless of whether they were elongated or not, were enriched in variant repeat types, which appeared to be cell-line specific. This suggests that the loss of ATRX, combined with telomere dysfunction during crisis, induces the ALT pathway in fibroblasts and enables a transient activation of ALT in epithelial cells. The research provides insights into the mechanism of ALT and how it may contribute to the onset of cancer.
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that affects host cells and its survival is due to the secretion of virulent factors. These factors are stored in specific organelles and are released when the parasite recognizes the host cell. Dense granules (DGs) are one of these organelles, and they have a crucial role in modulating the host's metabolic and immune responses. However, the mechanisms that regulate the release of DGs are not well understood. This study investigates the role of Rab11A, a regulator of exocytosis, in the release of DGs in T. gondii. The study found that Rab11A promotes the transport of DGs and the release of their content into the vacuolar space. Rab11A also regulates transmembrane protein trafficking and localization during parasite replication. Additionally, Rab11A regulates extracellular parasite motility and adhesion to host cells. Rab11A-defective parasites exhibited severe morphological defects and altered MIC2 secretion. Live imaging revealed a polarized accumulation of Rab11A-positive vesicles and DGs at the apical pole of extracellular motile and invading parasites. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Rab11A in the release of DGs and transmembrane protein delivery at the parasite PM, as well as its role in extracellular parasite adhesion and motility.
A single neuron's stimulation in the rat's somatosensory cortex can result in a behavioral response, according to a study. The likelihood of a behavioral response does not significantly depend on the duration or intensity of a constant stimulation. However, the response probability increases significantly with the injection of an irregular current. Mechanisms present in the dynamics of neurons and synapses can potentially suppress a constant input signal and explain these experimental findings. A network of integrate-and-fire neurons was studied, with features of neuronal populations in the rat barrel cortex. The model includes cellular spike-frequency adaptation, experimentally constrained numbers and types of chemical synapses with short-term plasticity, and gap junctions. Simulations of this model suggest that cellular and synaptic adaptation mechanisms alone may not account for the experimental results if the local network activity is read out by an integrator. However, a circuit that approximates a differentiator can detect the single-cell stimulation with a reliability that barely depends on the length or intensity of the stimulus, but increases when an irregular signal is used. This finding is in accordance with the experimental results obtained for the stimulation of a regularly-spiking excitatory cell.
Human skin is constantly exposed to damaging environmental factors that can cause DNA damage and mutations in skin cells. While the impact of UV radiation on skin cells and melanoma has been studied, the range of mutation load and types of somatic genome changes that accumulate in skin cells of healthy individuals has not been well understood. A study was conducted to sequence the genomes of single cell-derived clonal lineages obtained from primary skin cells of a large cohort of healthy individuals across a wide range of ages. The results showed that UV-induced base substitutions, insertions and deletions, as well as spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines and DNA replication errors, all contribute to the somatic mutation load in skin cells. The study also found that DNA replication stalling at common fragile sites can lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements in human cells. These findings suggest that somatic mutations in skin of healthy individuals reflect the interplay of environmental and endogenous factors in facilitating genome instability and carcinogenesis.
Clonorchiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis, which is found in China, Taiwan, Korea, eastern Russia, north Vietnam, and could spread further due to globalization. People get infected by eating raw, undercooked or salt-preserved fish containing the parasites' larval stages. Infections can lead to complications like bile duct obstruction, stone formation, cholangitis, hepatic fibrosis, and even bile duct cancer. In Vietnam, an endemic country for clonorchiasis, a study was conducted in four rural communes of Yen Bai and Thanh Hoa provinces to determine the prevalence of C. sinensis infection and associated risk factors.The study found a high overall prevalence of C. sinensis infection (40.4%), with commune prevalences ranging between 26.5% and 53.3%. Males, recent raw fish consumption, low education level, lack of treatment, being between 19 to 39 years old, and the presence of an unhygienic toilet were significantly associated with C. sinensis infection. This highlights the importance of control measures, such as mass drug administration and specific health education activities for risk groups in endemic areas.Clonorchiasis is associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, and the study found that raw fish eating behavior was associated with gender and age group, with males and younger individuals more likely to consume raw fish. The most commonly consumed raw fish species were black tilapia and silver carp, though there were differences in fish species consumed between provinces.In conclusion, the study demonstrated a high prevalence of C. sinensis infection in rural communities in northern Vietnam, and identified several risk factors and eating habits associated with the infection. These findings can help guide the development of efficient control programs and health education campaigns to reduce the prevalence of clonorchiasis in endemic areas.
Skin problems are a significant cause of illness in communities with poor living conditions, but they have received less attention in global health studies due to their low mortality rates. A study conducted among rural schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia found that almost three-fourths of them had at least one type of skin problem, with boys being at higher overall risk than girls. Risk factors for these skin problems included unclean fingernails, not washing the body and hair with soap every week, sharing beds, clothes, or combs, and living in a poor household. The study suggests the need to improve children’s personal hygiene through health education by schoolteachers and health workers to prevent these skin problems. Neglected tropical diseases, such as scabies, tungiasis, and tinea infections, are important medical challenges in resource-poor settings. These diseases are caused by parasitic skin infestations and fungal infections, respectively. They can have significant impacts on individuals' quality of life, including difficulty walking or gripping, sleep disturbances, and stigma. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of tungiasis ranges between 35% to 60% among school-aged children, and the prevalence of tinea among schoolchildren is about 25%. Poor hygiene, large families, overcrowding, shared fomites, poverty, and environmental conditions are important underlying social determinants for these three diseases. Schoolchildren in Ethiopia are vulnerable to various health problems, including high rates of nutritional disorders, intestinal parasitic infections, and skin problems. Although some school health programs include programs to address these diseases, most of these programs are non-functional. The study found that a Bayesian model, which estimates credible intervals for unknown parameters from posterior distribution, can provide important and additional information for assessing and managing these diseases.
This text discusses the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the interaction between mycobacteria and host immune cells. Mycobacteria, which cause diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy, can manipulate host signaling and immune pathways to increase their survival and establish chronic infection in cell-rich granulomas. The text focuses on miR-206, a member of the muscle-associated myomiR family, which is differentially regulated in mycobacterial infection. Infection of THP-1 cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a role for miR-206 in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine responses. The text uses the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model to investigate the in vivo function of miR-206 in mycobacterial infection. The study found that infection with M. marinum increased miR-206 expression at early time points, but decreased it at later time points. AntagomiR-mediated knockdown of miR-206 was protective against infection, and was associated with enhanced neutrophil response and reduced bacterial burden. The enhanced neutrophil response and reduced bacterial burden caused by miR-206 knockdown was dependent on the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling axis. The study illustrates a pathway through which pathogenic mycobacteria induce host miR-206 expression to suppress Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling and prevent protective neutrophil recruitment to granulomas.
This text discusses the use of machine learning techniques, particularly graph neural networks (GNN), to understand and predict the behavior of cells in tissues. The GNN models are used to analyze the spatiotemporal relationships between cells, including their contacts and lineages, as well as features such as gene expression levels and cell area. The model is trained using data from the basal layer of mouse skin, where cells can divide, delaminate, or stay in place. The GNN model is able to accurately predict the fate of cells (division, delamination, or no behavior) based on the spatiotemporal graphs and cell features. The model is also able to identify important features for making reliable predictions, such as cell area and G1-phase reporter signal. The model can still make predictions even when some of these features are removed, indicating that the graph structure itself encodes useful information for predicting cell fate. The model can also identify other subgraph motifs, such as the temporal length up to the last cell division point and neighbor cell fates, which can be used to predict future cell dynamics.
This text is about a study using a new method called TSCCA (Tensor Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis) to analyze the relationship between microRNA (miRNA) and gene expression in various cancers. The researchers used data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other databases to identify patterns of miRNA-gene co-expression in 33 different cancer types. They found several miRNA-gene modules (groups) that were significantly associated with cancer and had important biological functions. These modules could help us understand the regulatory mechanisms of cancer and guide miRNA-based cancer treatments. The TSCCA method can handle high-dimensional data, capture both shared and specific miRNA-gene patterns across cancers, and reveal the context-specific miRNA-gene regulatory relationships. It can also handle complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns by integrating multi-omics data of multi-cancers. The study presents a valuable tool for exploring the complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns and provides insights into miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer.
Lay Summary:The study investigates the interaction between short-term and long-term plasticity in the brain, which are crucial for learning and memory. Short-term plasticity lasts for a few minutes, while long-term plasticity lasts for hours to a lifetime. The researchers used a calcium-based model to study how both forms of plasticity work together to control the induction of synaptic depression and potentiation in the visual and somatosensory cortex. They found that the model, which includes known synaptic short-term dynamics in the calcium transients, can fit long-term plasticity data obtained in both cortical areas. The impact of spike-timing and firing rate changes on plasticity occurs in the prevalent firing rate range, which is different in both cortical areas. This suggests that short- and long-term plasticity are tuned to adapt to area-specific activity statistics such as firing rates. The findings have implications for our understanding of learning, memory, and brain function.
Bats are known to host various viruses, including Hendra virus (HeV), without showing symptoms. This has been attributed to their innate immune response. A study was conducted to compare the immune response and viral replication in Australian black flying foxes (bats) and ferrets after HeV infection. The study found that while bats had viral RNA in their lungs at 60 hours post-exposure (hpe), ferrets had widespread viral RNA and antigen in multiple organs by 60 hpe. The study also found that interferon (IFN) mRNA expression was antagonized in bats, while there was an increase in transcription of IFN in the spleen of ferrets following infection. Proteomic analysis of lung tissue revealed that six immune pathways, including those involved in cell-mediated immunity, were more likely to be upregulated in bats compared to ferrets. The type I IFN signaling pathway was enriched in both bats and ferrets. This study provides important insights into the differences in the dissemination of HeV and the activation of immune pathways in bats and ferrets in vivo following infection.
Genetic research has identified thousands of genomic risk factors and improved our understanding of disease causes and potential treatments. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are commonly used and often apply logistic regression to case/control data to report SNPs with significant odds ratios. An alternative view is the liability threshold model, which assumes case/control labels are determined by thresholding a hidden quantitative polygenic risk score (PRS) with linear effects over SNPs. This model is the basis for predicting disease risks and quantifying the variance explained by the PRS. However, recent research aims to understand the mechanisms by which genomic factors influence disease beyond simple linear effects of variants, as they often impact phenotypes indirectly through the expression of other genes.Heterogeneity in diseases has not been sufficiently recognized by GWAS, as individuals in cohorts are typically classified as cases or controls. Clinical evidence suggests that there are multiple subtypes consisting of distinct sets of symptoms and association with distinct rare risk alleles. For example, polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder explain more phenotypic variance when cases are partitioned into two known subtypes. Similarly, distinct polygenic risk scores are discovered for bipolar disorder subtypes. Heterogeneity in disease etiology is a concern for clinical applications, as the predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores varies across different demographics of patients. Therefore, methods to develop population-differentiated PRSs and detect deficiencies in existing PRSs are urgently needed before predictive genomics can be widely integrated into precision medicine.In this study, the authors present CLiP (Correlated Liability Predictors), a method to detect heterogeneity in single GWAS cohorts. CLiP calculates a weighted sum of correlations between SNPs contributing to a PRS on the case/control liability scale. The method demonstrates that in homogeneous cases generated by a liability threshold model, significant anti-correlations are expected between otherwise independent predictors due to ascertainment on the hidden liability score. In the presence of heterogeneity from distinct etiologies, confounding by covariates, or mislabeling, these correlation patterns are altered predictably. The study applies CLiP to heterogeneity detection in schizophrenia cohorts and observes significant heterogeneity based on significantly associated variants. The method also detects heterogeneity in neuroticism in over 10,000 individuals from the UK Biobank. Scores were not significantly reduced when partitioning by known subclusters, suggesting that these factors are not the primary source of observed heterogeneity.
A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed to recognize cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by influenza virus infection in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The model was trained using 601 images of mock-infected and influenza-infected MDCK cells, and it was able to recognize CPE with 99.75% accuracy. The model was further tested using 1190 images taken at different time points post virus infection, and the recognition rates were 71.80%, 98.25%, and 87.46% at 16, 28, and 40 hours post infection, respectively. The model was also able to specifically identify CPE induced by influenza virus, as it did not recognize images of MDCK cells infected with six other non-influenza viruses. The model was able to accurately recognize CPE at different time points post infection, making it a useful tool for timely identification of CPE in clinical practice.Cell culture remains the gold standard for primary isolation of viruses in clinical specimens. However, observation of cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by virus infection is subjective and can be labor-intensive. To improve the assay sensitivity and shorten the timing required for CPE identification, a simple CNN model was established using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to enhance the identification of influenza virus in clinical practice. The model was trained using 601 images of mock-infected and influenza-infected MDCK cells and was able to recognize CPE with 99.75% accuracy. The model was further tested using 1190 images taken at different time points post virus infection, and the recognition rates were 71.80%, 98.25%, and 87.46% at 16, 28, and 40 hours post infection, respectively. The model was also able to specifically identify CPE induced by influenza virus, as it did not recognize images of MDCK cells infected with six other non-influenza viruses. The model was able to accurately recognize CPE at different time points post infection, making it a useful tool for timely identification of CPE in clinical practice.In summary, a CNN model was developed to recognize cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by influenza virus infection in MDCK cells. The model was able to accurately recognize CPE at different time points post infection, making it a useful tool for timely identification of CPE in clinical practice. The model was also able to specifically identify CPE induced by influenza virus, as it did not recognize images of MDCK cells infected with six other non-influenza viruses. The use of this model can improve the sensitivity and speed of CPE identification, which is important for effective diagnosis and treatment of viral infections.
This text is a research paper about the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and its interaction with human cells. VZV is a virus that causes chickenpox and shingles in humans. The researchers were interested in how VZV interacts with a protein in human cells called ZBP1. They found that VZV can prevent ZBP1 from causing cell death, specifically a type of cell death called necroptosis. Necroptosis is a process where the cell's membrane ruptures, releasing its contents and causing inflammation. The researchers also found that a specific part of the VZV virus, called the RHIM-like sequence within ORF20, is important for this interaction with ZBP1. They altered this RHIM-like sequence and found that it no longer prevented ZBP1 from causing cell death. This suggests that this RHIM-like sequence in VZV is important for preventing ZBP1 from causing cell death. In summary, the researchers found that VZV has a way to prevent certain types of cell death in human cells, and this ability is related to a specific part of the virus.
Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic trematodes from the genus Schistosoma, and it is the second leading cause of parasitic disease globally. The risk for schistosomiasis can be divided into three distinct components: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Hazard is often described as 'malacological risk' and quantified using ecological indicators of snail populations within a water source. Exposure is approximated by studying human water contact behavior, and vulnerability determines whether a person can avoid or mitigate the schistosome hazard in their surroundings. Approximately 200 million people are infected with schistosomes worldwide, and the disease is treatable with the antiparasitic drug praziquantel. However, since praziquantel does not prevent new infections, the benefits of MDA have not been realized universally across all contexts. The identification of persistent hotspots has underscored the need for interventions that control transmission and complement the morbidity control achieved by MDA. Understanding the relative contributions of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability in the risk for acquiring and accumulating schistosome infections can inform which interventions to employ to mitigate risk and where, when, and how to implement them. In this study, the researchers aimed to understand the relative contribution of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability to the burden of urogenital schistosomiasis in an endemic region of northern Senegal. They found that exposure, hazard, and vulnerability are all important factors in the transmission of schistosomiasis, and that interventions that control transmission and complement the morbidity control achieved by MDA are needed to eliminate the disease.
Lassa fever (LF) is a dangerous viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in some Western African countries, particularly Nigeria, and is caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The virus is primarily transmitted to humans by infected rodents. The 2018 outbreak in Nigeria was severe, with thousands of suspected and hundreds of confirmed cases, resulting in many deaths. Although LF typically presents with fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and joint pain, it can also lead to severe hemorrhagic fever with multi-organ failure. However, the reasons for the increasing severity and frequency of outbreaks in Nigeria are unclear.LASV has a high degree of genetic diversity, and recent studies have highlighted a broader spectrum of LASV pathological signs through in vivo comparisons of isolates from different regions. A better understanding of the breadth of pathogenesis of genetically and geographically diverse LASV isolates in animal models of disease is imperative to discovering a universal vaccine candidate that can be deployed throughout West Africa.In this study, five LASV isolates from the 2018 Nigerian outbreak were genetically characterized and evaluated in vivo. Three of the five isolates were further evaluated in guinea pigs. The results showed that despite being closely related and from the same spatial/geographic region of Nigeria, only one of the three isolates proved lethal in guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs). This isolate exhibited atypical pathogenesis characteristics in the NHP model, most notably respiratory failure, which is not commonly described in hemorrhagic cases of LF. The study suggests that there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in LASV infections in Nigeria, which leads to a multitude of pathogenesis characteristics that could account for differences between subclinical and lethal LF infections.The study concludes by emphasizing the need to develop disease models using currently circulating LASV strains in West Africa, as it is critical for the evaluation of potential vaccines and medical countermeasures. A better understanding of the genetic diversity and pathogenesis of LASV isolates is crucial for developing effective vaccines and medical countermeasures against LF, which continues to pose a significant public health threat in West Africa.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that infects humans and causes schistosomiasis, a disease that affects over 260 million people worldwide. This study compares the hematological and biochemical profiles of 90 infected patients to 90 healthy controls. The results show that S. mansoni infected patients have a higher prevalence of anemia (23.3%) and thrombocytopenia (26.7%) compared to the healthy controls. The infected patients also had significantly lower white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts, as well as lower hemoglobin values, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Additionally, S. mansoni infected patients had higher levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response to parasites. The study also found that the levels of liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, were significantly higher in infected patients, indicating possible liver damage. These findings suggest that S. mansoni infection can have significant effects on the hematological and biochemical profiles of infected individuals, which can lead to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver damage. It is important for infected individuals to be screened for these abnormalities and treated appropriately to prevent complications and reduce the overall burden of the disease.
White blood cells, specifically B cells, play a crucial role in the immune response to pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). These pathogens can infect and affect the function of B cells, which are responsible for producing antibodies that help protect the body from infections. In this research, the authors investigated the impact of HCV on B cells, particularly class-switched B cells (csBC), and how this may influence the production of antibodies against the virus.The researchers used a technique called flow cytometry to analyze the B cells of individuals infected with HCV. They found that in individuals with persistent HCV infection, there was a reduction in the frequency of resting memory B cells (rMBC) and an increase in activated MBC (actMBC) and tissue-like MBC (tlMBC). Additionally, they observed upregulation of FCRL5, an IgG receptor, on sE2+ rMBC and PD-1 expression on sE2+ actMBC. These changes may limit the production of anti-E2 antibodies, which are important for protecting against HCV infection.In contrast, in individuals who spontaneously clear the infection, early development of IgG directed against E2 and early development of E2-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been associated with clearance. However, some individuals with spontaneous clearance demonstrate low-titer anti-E2 antibody responses, suggesting that clearance may be predominantly T cell-mediated in these cases.Overall, this research highlights the importance of B cells in the immune response to HCV and the potential implications of changes in B cell function for the development of an effective HCV vaccine. Further studies are needed to build on these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms of B cell dysfunction in HCV infection and other viral infections.
