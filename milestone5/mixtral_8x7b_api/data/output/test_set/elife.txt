Acylation of carbohydrates is a process that happens in all forms of life and is essential for various functions in bacteria, including symbiosis, resistance to viruses and antimicrobials, and biosynthesis of antibiotics. However, the structure and mechanism of the proteins that catalyze this process, called membrane-bound acyltransferase-3 (AT3) domain proteins, are largely unknown. In this study, researchers used a technique called evolutionary co-variance analysis to build a computational model of a bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB. The model showed that the AT3 domain of OafB has a unique structure with 10 transmembrane helices that form a large cytoplasmic cavity. The acyl-coA donor, which provides the acetyl group for the acylation process, is able to access the catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface through a pore created by a loop in the inner cavity. The fused SGNH domain in OafB is mobile and can both accept acyl-groups from the AT3 and then reach beyond the membrane to reach acceptor substrates. This new model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could be used to block critical functions of bacterial pathogens.
Honey bees have impressive decision-making skills when it comes to choosing flowers for nectar or pollen. They can quickly and accurately assess which flowers are most likely to offer rewards based on various factors such as the quality of evidence and the likelihood of reward or punishment. The researchers found that honey bee decision-making is sophisticated and can even rival that of primates.To study the decision-making abilities of honey bees, the researchers used a controlled flight arena that varied the likelihood of a stimulus offering reward or punishment and the quality of evidence for the stimuli. They found that honey bee decisions were sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence. Acceptance responses were more accurate than rejection responses and were more sensitive to changes in available evidence and reward likelihood. Fast acceptances were more likely to be correct than slower acceptances, indicating that the evidence threshold for a decision changes dynamically with sampling time.To understand the decision-making circuitry required for these capacities, the researchers developed a neurobiologically plausible model of decision-making that can be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain. This model proposes a system for robust autonomous decision-making with potential application in robotics.The researchers used signal detection theory to understand how bees make a decision. Signal detection theory is a framework for understanding and predicting how animals make decisions under uncertainty by modeling the relationship between the sensory information they receive and their ability to accurately discriminate between stimuli. The researchers found that for bees, discriminability is influenced by both available evidence and reward likelihood. When the likelihood of reward for the two stimuli is more similar, the decision criterion is closer to zero, indicating that the accuracy of acceptance and rejection is more similar.Overall, the researchers found that acceptance responses are more accurate than rejection responses, but reducing the available evidence reduces the capacity of bees to distinguish the correct and incorrect options. Bees differ in the time they spend inspecting stimuli, and the acceptance response is more accurate than the rejection, indicating a higher level of discrimination. However, in the reduced evidence test, bees struggled to distinguish the correct and incorrect options. The conditional accuracy functions (CAF) for acceptance and rejection responses showed that bees made correct acceptances faster than incorrect acceptances, but decisions based on reduced evidence are slower and less accurate. The CAF for the rejection response showed that rejection time did not vary with accuracy.The researchers also found that bees were more likely to reject when either the available evidence or the reward likelihood was reduced. They assessed various computational sequential sampling models to explore what kinds of computation are necessary for these capacities of decision-making.In conclusion, honey bees have sophisticated decision-making skills that are influenced by various factors such as the quality of evidence, reward likelihood, and available evidence. The researchers' findings provide insights into the decision-making circuitry required for these capacities and proposes a system for robust autonomous decision-making with potential application in robotics.
Metformin, a commonly prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes, has been associated with longer lifespan and reduced risk of age-related diseases in humans. While its benefits are clear, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully understood. A recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans found that biguanides like metformin and phenformin extend lifespan by stimulating the biosynthesis of ether lipids, which are a unique type of lipid that contains a fatty alcohol conjugated to the glycerol backbone at the sn-1 position via an ether linkage. These lipids are important for cell membrane fluidity, formation of lipid rafts, and regulation of cell differentiation, signaling, and oxidative stress.The study found that loss-of-function mutations in genes required for ether lipid biosynthesis, including fard-1, acl-7, and ads-1, significantly reduce lifespan extension induced by biguanides. These mutations also impair lifespan extension promoted by other genetic longevity paradigms, including defective mitochondrial electron transport function, defective pharyngeal pumping/caloric restriction, and compromises in mTOR complex 1 activation. Overexpression of fard-1, the enzyme that produces fatty alcohols for ether lipid biogenesis in C. elegans, extends lifespan.The study also found that phenformin treatment increases the levels of multiple phosphatidylethanolamine-containing ether lipids in C. elegans through direct biguanide action on the worm, rather than on the bacterial food source. Ether lipids promote longevity downstream of biguanide action through activation of metabolic stress defenses and somatic lipid redistribution driven by the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf. These data suggest a heretofore unappreciated role for ether lipids in enabling organismal-level, longevity-promoting stress defenses. Overall, these findings highlight the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery as a novel therapeutic target to promote healthy aging.
Gut microbiomes are diverse and dynamic communities made up of various ecological relationships between bacteria. These relationships can be mutualistic, such as syntrophy and cross-feeding, or competitive, including parasitism and predation. These relationships affect various biological processes that impact host health and fitness, including metabolism, toxin breakdown, and the synthesis of important compounds. However, there are still many gaps in understanding these ecological relationships and how they shape gut microbiome assembly, stability, and productivity. Some researchers believe that correlative relationships between microbes will not be consistent across hosts and will instead be individualized to each host. However, recent studies suggest that microbiome community ecology is not highly individualized and is instead largely consistent across hosts. This consistency is observed in humans, non-human primates, and other animals. For example, one study found that most bacterial correlations are weak, negative, and universal across hosts, such that shared correlation patterns dominate over host-specific correlations by almost twofold. Furthermore, taxon pairs that had inconsistent correlation signs (either positive or negative) in different hosts always had weak correlations within hosts. Host pairs with the most similar bacterial correlation patterns also had similar microbiome taxonomic compositions and tended to be genetic relatives. Compared to humans, universality in baboons was similar to that in human infants, and stronger than one data set from human adults. This suggests that bacterial families that showed universal correlations in human infants were often universal in baboons. These findings contribute new tools for analyzing the universality of bacterial associations across hosts, with implications for microbiome personalization, community assembly, and stability, and for designing microbiome interventions to improve host health.
Gamma oscillations are a type of brain wave that occur in the frequency range of 30-100 Hz. They have been studied in the context of cognitive functions such as sensory processing, memory, navigation, and conscious awareness. In the brain, gamma oscillations have been shown to modulate spiking activity and shape the formation of transient neuronal partnerships, also known as cell assemblies. These oscillations have been observed to emerge from synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and depend on local inhibitory-inhibitory or excitatory-inhibitory interactions. Gamma oscillations are not a monolithic entity, but rather encompass a diversity of rhythms observed experimentally. One specific type of gamma oscillation is low-gamma oscillations, which have been shown to be entrained by respiration in the piriform cortex of awake mice.In the piriform cortex, a region of the brain that is responsible for olfactory processing, low-gamma oscillations have been found to be driven by respiration and to derive from feedback inhibition. These oscillations are generated locally within the piriform circuit and show a phase reversal near layer 2, where pyramidal cells are located. The time course of feedback inhibitory interneuron firing rate has been found to correlate with the amplitude of low-gamma oscillations, while principal cells and feedforward interneurons spike earlier within the respiratory cycle and return to baseline during the gamma amplitude peak. These results suggest that respiration-driven low-gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex arise from feedback inhibition.Furthermore, the local computations underlying the respiration-driven gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex have been studied through the selective expression of the tetanus toxin light chain in principal cells of a targeted hemisphere. This approach blocks excitatory synaptic transmission without affecting cellular excitability, allowing for the study of the local computations underlying the respiration-driven gamma. Results have shown that gamma oscillations and their coupling to respiration depend on local recurrent excitatory connections within the piriform cortex.Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations and their relationship with respiration in the mouse brain.
Genetics and genomics are fields of study that look at how genes and genomes work, including chromosomes and gene expression. Chromosomes are structures in the cell that contain genes, and gene expression is how genes create proteins. A key part of this process is the replication of chromosomes during S phase, where certain domains replicate at specific times. However, it's not fully understood how the timing of this replication is determined.A study in Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, looked at this process in more detail. In these flies, some parts of the chromosomes, called intercalary and pericentric heterochromatin, do not fully replicate during certain cell cycles. This is important because it provides a way to study how replication is regulated.The researchers focused on a gene called SuUR, which is essential for this underreplication. SuUR encodes a protein with a helicase domain, which is a type of protein that can separate DNA strands. They used a new proteomics approach to discover that SuUR forms a stable complex with a chromatin boundary protein called Mod(Mdg4)-67.2. This complex is required for maximal underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin and full activity of the gypsy insulator, which is a region of the genome that prevents certain interactions between enhancers and promoters and establishes barriers between euchromatin and heterochromatin.The researchers also found that SuUR and Mod(Mdg4)-67.2 together mediate the activities of the gypsy insulator, and that SuUR or mod(mdg4) mutations reverse underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin. This suggests that SuUR, a SNF2 family ATP-dependent motor protein, plays a role in the insulator function and that DNA replication can be delayed by a chromatin barrier. This mechanism for the establishment of late replication does not depend on an asynchronous firing of late replication origins. These findings have implications for our understanding of how genome function, DNA replication, and chromatin barriers work.
Biological age refers to the overall health and resilience of an individual, which can be assessed through various biological indicators such as telomere length and DNA methylation age. In a study of European school-age children, these biological age indicators were used to examine their relationship with child developmental outcomes, including growth, adiposity, cognition, behavior, lung function, and the onset of puberty. The study found that all biological age markers were associated with greater BMI and fat mass, and all markers except telomere length were associated with greater height. Immunometabolic Δ age was associated with better working memory and reduced inattentiveness, while DNA methylation Δ age was associated with greater inattentiveness and poorer externalizing behaviors. Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors. In children, as in adults, biological aging appears to be a multi-faceted process and adiposity is an important correlate of accelerated biological aging. Patterns of associations suggested that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging, apparent even in children.
This text is a medical research paper about genetics and genomics, epidemiology and global health. It reports on a study that aimed to identify genetic associates of childhood wheezing phenotypes. The study used a novel multivariate GWAS meta-analysis of wheezing phenotypes jointly derived from data collected from birth to 18 years in 9568 individuals from five UK birth cohorts. The study identified a number of independent SNPs associated with different wheezing phenotypes, including a novel locus on chr9q21 that is associated exclusively with early-onset persistent wheeze. This locus is near the gene ANXA1, and the risk allele (T) confers a reduction in ANXA1 expression. The study also found that in a murine model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway disease, anxa1 protein expression increased and anxa1 mRNA was significantly induced in lung tissue following HDM exposure. Additionally, loss of anxa1 results in heightened airway hyperreactivity and Th2 inflammation upon allergen challenge. This suggests that targeting this pathway in persistent disease may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect. The study was funded by the UK Medical Research Council Programme Grant MR/S025340/1 and the Wellcome Trust Strategic Award (108818/15/Z).In simpler terms, this study looked at the genetic factors that contribute to different types of wheezing in children. The researchers found a specific gene (ANXA1) that is associated with a certain type of wheezing (early-onset persistent) and they found that a specific version of this gene (the risk allele T) is associated with a reduction in the amount of ANXA1 protein produced. They also did experiments in mice and found that when they exposed the mice to a common allergen (house dust mites), the mice with the risk allele T had increased levels of a protein called anxa1 in their lungs and they had more severe allergic reactions. The study suggests that targeting this pathway in persistent disease may be a promising therapeutic target.
Intercropping, or growing multiple species together in the same field, can enhance agricultural sustainability by capitalizing on the positive relationship between biodiversity and productivity. However, using commercial seeds that are bred for maximal productivity in monocultures may limit the benefits of crop diversity on yield. A study was conducted to investigate the potential of parental diversity affecting plant-plant interactions, species complementarity, and ecosystem functioning in annual cropping systems. The study found that plant-plant interactions among annual crops shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when the plants were growing in the same community type as their parents did in the previous two generations. This shift in plant-plant interactions was accompanied by character convergence between species sharing the same coexistence history for two generations, with the six crop species tested converging towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content. The study provides the first empirical evidence for the potential of parental diversity affecting plant-plant interactions, species complementarity, and ecosystem functioning of the following generations in annual cropping systems. This finding has important implications for diversified agriculture, as it illustrates the potential of targeted cultivars to increase complementarity of species in intercropping, which could be achieved through specific breeding for mixtures. Further studies are required to assess the context-dependence of these results.
"This text is about a study that compares how humans and macaque monkeys make decisions in social situations. The study involved a game where two agents, either human or monkey, sit face-to-face and play a game on a shared touchscreen. The researchers observed how the agents coordinated their actions in a game called ""Bach-or-Stravinsky,"" which requires the agents to choose between two opposing options.The study found that human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize payoffs. On the other hand, macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination. However, after training with a human confederate, two macaque pairs learned to coordinate dynamically. This dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans but can occur in macaques with different social attitudes and cognitive capacities. The study highlights the importance of action visibility in promoting coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions.In summary, this study found that both humans and macaques can coordinate their actions in a social game, but humans are more likely to use dynamic turn-taking, while macaques use static coordination. However, with training, macaques can learn to coordinate dynamically like humans. These findings suggest that social coordination is not unique to humans and can be observed in other primates with training and observation of each other's actions."
This text is about the study of female reproduction, specifically the development of ovarian follicles. Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. While efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. The researchers have found that simultaneously overexpressing two transcription factors (TFs) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. They have identified the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and established that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. These granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, their cells form ovary-like organoids (ovaroids) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.
The study focused on the genetic basis of skin color variation in a Native American population, the Kalinago of Dominica, who have genetic admixture from Africa but low frequency of European light skin alleles. The Kalinago have approximately 55% Native American, 32% African, and 12% European genetic ancestry, the highest Native American genetic ancestry among Caribbean populations to date. Skin pigmentation ranged from 20 to 80 melanin units, averaging 46. Three albino individuals were found to be homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV contained within a haplotype of African origin. The study also found that Native American genetic ancestry by itself reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units, but the responsible hypopigmenting genetic variants remain to be identified. The shared genetic ancestry of East Asians and Native Americans suggests the likelihood that some light skin color alleles are shared between these populations. The study aimed to find an admixed Native American population with high African, but low European admixture, as European hypopigmenting alleles may mask the effects of East Asian and Native American alleles. The Kalinago were found to have more Native American and less European genetic ancestry than any other Caribbean population. The Kalinago have among the lowest European genetic ancestry (12%) compared to other reported Caribbean Native Americans in St. Kitts (8.2%), Barbados (11.5%), and Puerto Rico (71%).
Exercise and antioxidant interventions can improve blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance in different ways. Moderate exercise upregulates compensatory antioxidant capability and reaches a higher level of redox balance in the liver, while antioxidant intervention achieves a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both interventions promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, thus ameliorating diabetes. However, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promotes hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation, while excessive exercise increases oxidative damage and inhibits the activity and expression of AMPK. Therefore, the AMPK signaling activation, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as sentinel biomarkers, reflecting the threshold of redox balance that is linked to effective glucose control in diabetes. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.
Prey animals use escape trajectories (ET) to avoid being caught by predators. These trajectories can vary greatly between different species and even within the same species. While it was previously believed that prey have a single preferred ET, many animals exhibit multiple preferred ETs. A new study created a geometric model to explain this variability. The model takes into account the time it takes for prey to turn and the predator's position at the end of its attack. By adjusting the parameters of the model, the researchers were able to replicate various patterns of ETs, including a single preferred ET and multiple preferred ETs at small and large angles from the predator. This model provides a new framework for understanding how animals choose their ETs and can be applied to various species, including fish, insects, and frogs.
Prime editing (PE) is a new genome editing technology that can simplify the creation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) disease models. PE is a system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). The pegRNA is reverse transcribed and functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. PE is more efficient and precise than traditional gene editing methods in hPSCs, particularly in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. The expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limits PE in hPSCs. Delivering the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. This mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson’s disease in hPSCs. PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is a way to divide MM patients into three stages (I, II, and III) based on certain factors. People with stage III MM have the worst outcomes, while those with stage I MM have the best. However, not much is known about the differences in tumor makeup between these stages.In this study, researchers used a technique called single-cell transcriptome sequencing to examine the genetic makeup of MM tumors at the single-cell level. They looked at tumors from 9 MM patients, including some at each stage of the disease, as well as tumors from 2 healthy people for comparison. After analyzing the data, they found that there are certain genetic differences between the different stages of MM. Specifically, they found that certain types of plasma cells were more common in stage II MM, while other types were more common in stage III MM. They also found that certain genes were more active in stage III MM, which could be contributing to the more aggressive nature of the disease at this stage. These findings could help researchers develop better treatments for MM by targeting the specific genetic changes that occur in each stage of the disease.
Cas7-11 is a type of CRISPR-Cas system that can be used for programmable RNA cleavage and has potential applications in RNA interference. It is unique because it has a single polypeptide containing four Cas7-like and one Cas11-like segments, which makes it resemble both multi-subunit Class 1 and single-subunit Class-2 CRISPR-Cas systems. Researchers have determined the structure of the active Cas7-11 from Desulfonema ishimotonii using cryo-electron microscopy, which has revealed the molecular basis for its RNA processing and interference activities. The structure shows that the Cas7-like and Cas11-like domains of Cas7-11 are arranged in an extended form that resembles the backbone of multi-subunit enzymes, but the backbone of Cas7-11 contains evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains, giving rise to its unique functionality. The structure and mutational data suggest that it may be possible to engineer a compact and programmable RNA interference tool using Cas7-11.
Biodiversity loss is a major concern due to its impact on ecosystems and their functions. While many studies have focused on how the number of species affects functions like plant productivity, fewer have looked at the effects of genetic diversity within species. A study on a tree species and genetic diversity experiment found that both species and genetic diversity affect tree productivity. In monocultures, genetic diversity had negative effects on productivity, but in a mixture of four tree species, genetic diversity had positive effects. The effects of genetic diversity on productivity were due to changes in functional diversity and soil fungal diversity. The study suggests that both species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation efforts to better understand and predict the consequences of biodiversity loss.
Researchers have discovered a new way to study molecular interactions in live cells using a technique called Proximity-Assisted Photoactivation (PAPA). This method uses a novel property of rhodamine dyes, where one fluorophore, the 'sender', can reactivate a second fluorophore, the 'receiver', from a dark state when they are in close proximity. PAPA operates at a longer average distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and can be used to detect protein-protein interactions and highlight labeled protein complexes in live cells. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of PAPA by detecting the correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. This new technique provides a powerful tool for studying molecular interactions in live cells and has potential applications in various fields, including cell biology and structural biology.
Calcium supplementation can help improve bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in young people. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that calcium supplementation was associated with the accretion of BMD and BMC, especially on the femoral neck and total body. The improvement of bone at the femoral neck was more pronounced in the peripeak bone mass (PBM) population (20-35 years) than the pre-PBM population (<20 years). This suggests that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving PBM may be beneficial for osteoporosis prevention. However, there were no effects on total hip BMD and BMC and lumbar spine BMD. Calcium supplementation may have a greater impact on BMD and BMC in women than in men and in Western countries than in Asian countries. Additionally, the beneficial effect of calcium supplementation on BMD and BMC may be maintained for at least 1 year after the intervention, but it may disappear when the follow-up period exceeds 2 years. Calcium supplementation with vitamin D showed greater beneficial effects on femoral neck BMD and BMC.
This text discusses microbiology and infectious diseases, as well as physics of living systems. It focuses on how the behavior of liquid and solid-like biomolecular condensates differs based on their distinct physicochemical properties. The text discusses how phase transitions affect the function of biological condensates and how material properties can be tuned by factors such as temperature, concentration, and valency. The researchers use influenza A virus (IAV) liquid cytosolic condensates, also known as viral inclusions, to study this. They found that liquid IAV inclusions can be hardened by targeting vRNP (viral ribonucleoprotein) interactions via the known NP (nucleoprotein) oligomerising molecule, nucleozin, both in vitro and in vivo without affecting host proteome abundance nor solubility. This could potentially be used to understand how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions and may offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies.
Kinesin superfamily proteins are molecular motors that move along microtubules, which are structures within cells that help in the organization and movement of cellular components. Kinesin-4 is a unique member of the kinesin superfamily that inhibits microtubule dynamics, or the growth and shrinkage of microtubules. A specific protein in the kinesin-4 family, KLP-12, has been shown to be essential for proper length control of axons, or nerve cell extensions, in C. elegans, a type of roundworm. When the activity of KLP-12 is not proper, the axons of these worms can become too long or too short. The mammalian orthologs of KLP-12, KIF21A and KIF21B, also regulate the length of axons in mammals, suggesting that the function of KLP-12 is evolutionarily conserved. In vitro experiments, which are experiments conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, have shown that KLP-12 can move along microtubules and decrease the rate at which they grow, further supporting the idea that KLP-12 inhibits microtubule dynamics. Overall, the research suggests that KLP-12 plays a crucial role in regulating the length of axons and the functioning of the brain.
Stem cells are essential for the development and maintenance of animal bodies. The most basic type of stem cell, the totipotent stem cell, can develop into any type of cell and can even create a new organism. A new study suggests that the characteristics of the totipotent stem cell evolved as a defense mechanism against transposable elements, or transposons, which are pieces of DNA that can move to different parts of the genome and cause mutations.The study focuses on the stem cells of the female reproductive system of fruit flies, called germline stem cells (GSCs). These stem cells produce new cells that will become eggs. The GSCs have a number of unique features that allow them to resist transposon activity and maintain their totipotent state.First, the GSCs have relatively open chromatin, which is the structure that DNA forms when it is packaged into chromosomes. This open chromatin allows the GSCs to express a wide variety of genes, which is necessary for their totipotent state. However, the GSCs also have mechanisms in place to restrict this open chromatin and prevent the expression of certain genes. One of these mechanisms is the Polycomb repression of testis or somatic cell-expressed genes, which are genes that are briefly active in early female germ cells.In addition to these chromatin modifications, the GSCs also have unique metabolic processes that help them maintain their totipotent state. For example, the Neijre/CBP and Myc proteins help upregulate growth and reprogram the GSCs' metabolism by altering mitochondrial transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis, and other processes. These metabolic changes are similar to those that occur in the totipotent zygote, the fertilized egg cell.The study suggests that these features of the GSCs evolved as a defense mechanism against transposons. Transposons can cause mutations and disrupt the function of genes, so it is important for the GSCs to have mechanisms in place to resist their activity. By maintaining a totipotent state and having the ability to differentiate into any type of cell, the GSCs are able to produce healthy eggs and ensure the continuation of the species.
The text discusses plant biology and developmental biology, particularly focusing on the circadian clock in sunflowers. The circadian clock is a biological clock found in most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes that regulates biological timing. Circadian rhythms, biological processes regulated by the circadian clock, have specific characteristics such as being stably entrained to environmental cues, persisting in free-running environmental conditions, being temperature compensated, and gating certain biological processes so that responsiveness to environmental cues is time-of-day dependent. The circadian clock plays a crucial role in controlling the timing of reproductive development in plants, allowing organisms to distinguish between the long and short days of different seasons.The text specifically focuses on sunflowers, which are an excellent model system to study the temporal regulation of floral development. Sunflowers are characterized by the arrangement of individual florets together in a complex, compressed inflorescence called the capitulum. Individual florets are arranged on the capitulum disk in spiral patterns, a classic type of phyllotaxis observed in many plants. In domesticated sunflowers, specification of the hundreds or even thousands of floret primordia found on a single capitulum takes approximately 10-14 days, followed approximately 20 days later by the onset of anthesis, or floral opening, of the first florets. Anthesis of all florets on a capitulum head typically occurs over 5-10 days.The text also discusses the timing of anthesis and its effects on visits by pollinating insects, thus linking circadian control of floral maturation with plant reproductive success. The text also suggests a role for the circadian clock in the spatial as well as temporal control of sunflower development. The results show that temperature-compensated daily rhythms in development of both male and female floral organs, and the formation of pseudowhorls, persist when flowers are maintained in constant environmental conditions in the absence of light. However, both daily rhythms in development and the formation of pseudowhorls are lost in constant light, leading to negative impacts on pollinator visits. The effects of light on floret development are time-of-day-dependent. Together, these data indicate that late-stage floret development is regulated by the circadian clock. Field experiments reveal that the timing of anthesis affects visits by pollinating insects, thus linking circadian control of floral maturation with plant reproductive success. The data suggest a role for the circadian clock in the spatial as well as temporal control of sunflower development.
C. elegans nematodes are often exposed to various threats in their natural habitat, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and high temperature. H2O2 is a chemical threat that can be produced by bacteria and can shorten the nematodes' lifespan. High temperature is also a physical threat that can shorten their lifespan. A study found that when nematodes are exposed to H2O2 and high temperature at the same time, the H2O2 becomes more lethal to them. However, the nematodes can increase their peroxide resistance by experiencing high temperature before being exposed to H2O2. This is because the nematodes can induce their hydrogen peroxide defenses when grown at a higher temperature, which helps them better cope with H2O2 produced by the pathogenic bacterium E. faecium. This temperature-dependent regulation of peroxide defenses is directed by the AFD sensory neurons. The AFD neurons repress the expression of the INS-39 insulin/IGF1 hormone at high temperature, which alleviates inhibition by insulin/IGF1 signaling of the nematodes’ peroxide defenses. The insulin/IGF1 effector DAF-16/FOXO functions in intestinal cells to determine the size of the gene-expression changes induced by the absence of signals from the AFD neurons. By coupling the induction of H2O2 defenses to the perception of high temperature, the nematodes can assess faithfully the threat that H2O2 poses.
This text is about immunology and inflammation, specifically focusing on chromosomes and gene expression. The abstract explains that class switch recombination, a process that generates distinct antibody isotypes, is dependent on transcription and can be affected by R loops. R loops are DNA:RNA hybrids that form during transcription and can impact double-strand break formation and repair. The study found that cells lacking certain enzymes involved in R loop removal have increased R loop formation and genome instability, and these cells also have increased insertion mutations at switch junctions.The introduction goes into more detail about the process of class switch recombination and how transcription and AID recruitment are necessary for this process. AID recruitment is a highly regulated process, and transcriptional activity, RNA polymerase II cofactors, and the elongation factor complex PAF1 all play a role in AID recruitment. Pre-mRNA splicing and G4 quadruplex structures also play a role in AID recruitment. The introduction also discusses the role of R loops in class switch recombination and how they can promote AID recruitment and double-strand break formation. However, the exact mechanism of how R loops are resolved to promote double-strand break repair is unclear.The conclusion and discussion sections of the text summarize the findings of the study, which suggest that RNase H2 and senataxin act redundantly to mediate timely R loop removal and promote efficient repair while suppressing AID-dependent genome instability and insertional mutagenesis. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of class switch recombination and the role of R loops in this process. Further studies can build on this analysis to see if phase-amplitude coupling also supports phase coding and neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.
A vaccine using a mosaic-type trimer of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been developed and tested in rats. This vaccine, called mos-tri-RBD, includes mutations from the Omicron variant and other circulating variants. The vaccine was compared to a homologous trimer of RBDs from the original strain (homo-tri-RBD) and to an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). The mos-tri-RBD vaccine elicited a stronger immune response against the Omicron variant and other variants compared to the homo-tri-RBD and BBIBP-CorV vaccines. The mos-tri-RBD vaccine may serve as an effective vaccine candidate in fighting against the Omicron variant and other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally, when used as a booster dose following primary vaccination with BBIBP-CorV, the mos-tri-RBD vaccine induced a stronger immune response compared to a homologous booster of BBIBP-CorV.
Malaria is a deadly infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, with P. falciparum being the most dangerous to humans. In 2020, there were over 600,000 deaths due to malaria, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Current front-line therapies, such as artemisinin and its derivatives, are becoming less effective as resistance to these drugs continues to develop. In order to combat malaria, new therapeutic targets and compounds with novel modes of action are required. Plasmodium falciparum parasites infect human red blood cells where they digest the host’s main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase PfA-M17 is one of several aminopeptidases that have been implicated in the last step of this digestive pathway. Researchers used genetic modification and a specially designed compound to show that PfA-M17 is essential for P. falciparum survival as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth. They also found that loss of PfA-M17 results in parasites exhibiting multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage. PfA-M17 is a potential novel drug target for combating malaria.
This text is about a study on hematopoiesis, the process by which blood cells are formed in the body. The study used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the gene expression profiles of bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from young and elderly healthy donors. The cells were classified into different subpopulations, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), early progenitors, and cells committed to specific lineages. The study found that there were significant changes in the proportions of these cell types between young and elderly donors. For example, there was a significant increase in the proportion of HSCs and a reduction in the number of both committed lymphoid and myeloid lineages in elderly donors. There were also changes in the expression of genes involved in erythroid differentiation, such as TRIB2. Additionally, the comparison between transcriptional programs and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) regulating normal HSPCs and MDS HSPCs allowed identification of regulons that were specifically active in MDS cases, suggesting a role of these transcription factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that the combination of single-cell technologies with computational analysis tools enables the study of a variety of cellular mechanisms involved in complex biological systems such as early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with perturbations such as aging and malignant transformation. Identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients.
Honey bees, like other animals, need to learn to ignore irrelevant stimuli and pay attention to ones that are important for survival. One way they do this is through a process called latent inhibition, where learning is delayed or reduced when a stimulus that was previously experienced without reinforcement is later associated with a reward. Individual honey bees differ in their degree of latent inhibition, and these differences have a genetic basis.To understand the genetic mechanisms behind these differences, researchers selected two lines of honey bees with high and low latent inhibition and crossed them. They found that a gene called Amtyr1, which codes for the receptor AmTYR1, is involved in the expression of latent inhibition. Disrupting Amtyr1 signaling through pharmacological means or RNAi changed the expression of latent inhibition without affecting appetitive conditioning. These results suggest that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the central nervous system (CNS).Electrophysiological recordings during pharmacological blockade support a model where AmTYR1 indirectly regulates at inhibitory synapses in the CNS. These findings identify a distinct Amtyr1-based modulatory pathway for nonassociative learning and suggest a model for how Amtyr1 acts as a gain control to modulate Hebbian plasticity at defined synapses in the CNS.Furthermore, variability in Amtyr1 signaling may be due to differential gene expression through transcriptional regulation, rather than mutations in the coding regions. This has implications for understanding how this gene exerts broad pleiotropic effects on several different behaviors and how colonies explore for and exploit pollen and nectar resources.
The text describes a new method for identifying and tracking diverse cell types within an organ in real time, in a non-destructive way. This method uses a non-invasive imaging modality that capitalizes on the endogenous autofluorescence signatures of the metabolic cofactors NAD (P) H and FAD. By marrying morphological characteristics with autofluorescence signatures, all seven of the airway epithelial cell types can be distinguished simultaneously in mouse tracheal explants in real time. This method avoids the pitfalls associated with the use of ostensibly cell type-specific markers that are altered by clinically relevant physiologic stimuli. The method is then used to interrogate real-time physiology and identify dynamic secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs) that form in response to cholinergic stimulus. These SAPs are similar to goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs) in the intestine, where they enable luminal antigen sampling. Airway secretory cells with SAPs are frequently juxtaposed to antigen presenting cells, suggesting that airway SAPs, like their intestinal counterparts, not only sample antigen but convey their cargo for immune cell processing.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, partly because adult hearts can't regenerate after injury. A process called methylation, specifically N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, plays a key role in various biological processes. However, its role in heart regeneration is unclear. Researchers modified the expression of m6A in vitro and in vivo and found that reducing m6A methylation increased the proliferation of heart cells and improved heart regeneration in newborn and adult mice. Conversely, increasing m6A methylation decreased heart cell proliferation and hindered heart regeneration. This study suggests that m6A methylation controls heart regeneration by regulating the levels of a specific gene, Fgf16, and its related pathways. This discovery could pave the way for new strategies to promote heart regeneration.
"Certain types of primary cancers can cause an increased risk of developing another type of primary cancer in the same individual. This study used data from the SEER program and the UK Biobank to analyze the relationship between 26 types of cancer. The study found that patients with oral and pharynx cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer had an increased risk of developing certain other cancers. These findings suggest that not only the amount of neural firing, but also the specific timing of it (the phase) is important for how the brain represents information. Future studies could build on this analysis to see if these phase-amplitude coupling patterns also support neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.This study also supports the hypothesis of ""phase coding"" in humans, which suggests that not only how much neural firing occurs, but also when (or specifically, at what phase) it occurs is important for how the brain represents information. This has implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and stores information, and could have implications for the development of treatments for brain disorders."
Economic decisions involve choosing between items based on their perceived value. In economic decision-making, individuals shift their gaze between the available options. These shifts in gaze can influence choice, causing a bias in favor of the items that are viewed first, last, or viewed for the overall longest duration. This suggests a mechanism that links gaze behavior to the neural computations underlying value-based choices. To identify this mechanism, a suitable animal model is needed. A study created a novel value-based choice task for macaque monkeys that captures the essential features of human paradigms where gaze biases have been observed. The monkeys’ gaze biases were found to be both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in humans, and were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework previously used to describe gaze biases in humans. This suggests a common mechanism that can explain gaze-related choice biases across species, opening the way for mechanistic studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.
Insects that eat plants usually specialize in a few or just one type of host plant, but some can eat a wide variety of plants from many different families. It's unclear whether this broad diet is due to the insects using common compounds found in all host plants (metabolic generalism) or if they use specific compounds found in each type of plant (multi-host metabolic specialism). A study was done to investigate this by looking at the metabolomes (the complete set of metabolites) of four different fruits and of the generalist insect Drosophila suzukii that ate those fruits. The results showed that when the insects ate different types of biochemically dissimilar fruits, their metabolomes became similar, supporting the metabolic generalism hypothesis. Many diet-specific metabolites, such as those related to the color, odor, or taste of the fruits, were not metabolized and instead accumulated in the insects. This suggests that dietary generalism in Drosophila suzukii may be due to a passive, opportunistic use of various resources, which could later lead to the evolution of new diet specializations.
Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the plague, evolved from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis around 6000-7000 years ago. These two species have different life cycles, with Y. pseudotuberculosis being transmitted through the faecal-oral route and causing a mild disease, while Y. pestis is highly virulent and transmitted by flea bites. A key difference between the two species is the ability of Y. pestis to form biofilms in the flea's proventriculus, which blocks the flea's feeding and helps transmit the bacteria to new hosts.The Rcs phosphorelay system, a signaling pathway in enterobacteria, plays a crucial role in the biofilm formation of Y. pestis. A gene in this system, rcsD, has undergone a frameshift mutation in Y. pestis. This mutation results in the production of a small protein, RcsD-Hpt, which negatively regulates biofilm formation. This is in contrast to the full-length RcsD protein, which positively regulates biofilm formation in Y. pseudotuberculosis. The frameshift mutation in rcsD is thought to have fine-tuned biofilm production in Y. pestis, allowing it to effectively colonize and transmit via fleas.In summary, genetic changes in Y. pseudotuberculosis, including the pseudogenization of rcsA and a frameshift mutation in rcsD, have driven the emergence of Y. pestis and its ability to transmit via fleas through biofilm formation. The Rcs phosphorelay system, and specifically the protein RcsD-Hpt, plays a crucial role in the regulation of biofilm formation in Y. pestis.
This text is a research paper about a study that used OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, to analyze language use in peer review reports from neuroscience papers published in Nature Communications. The study found that ChatGPT was able to accurately score the sentiment and politeness of the reviews, and it did so better than other available tools. The majority of the 572 peer reviews analyzed were of positive sentiment, with 99.8% of reviews deemed polite. However, a regression analysis showed a strong relation between the reviews’ sentiment and politeness scores, meaning the more positive a review, the more polite the reviewer’s language generally is. The study also found high levels of disagreement between reviewers’ favorability of a paper, suggesting that the peer review process is subjective. Additionally, the study found that first authors with a female name received less polite reviews, indicating a potential gender bias in reviewing. Female senior authors, on the other hand, received more favorable reviews. The study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts and identifying areas of concern in scientific publishing.In simpler terms, the study used a computer program to read and understand peer review reports from neuroscience papers. The program was able to understand if the reviews were positive, negative, or neutral, and if the language used in the reviews was polite or impolite. The study found that the program was good at this, and it was better than other tools available. Most of the reviews were positive and polite. However, the study also found that reviews of papers with female first authors were less polite, but reviews of papers with female senior authors were more favorable. This suggests that there may be a gender bias in reviewing. Overall, the study shows that using this computer program can help improve the way scientific research is published by identifying any problems in the review process.
This text discusses the use of interferon-alpha (IFNα) in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its effects on liver metastasis in mouse models. The study found that continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of IFNα can control CRC invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs) without requiring a direct action on tumor cells or other liver cells. IFNα also promotes the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche by causing liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) to defenestrate, leading to extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition and strengthening the liver vascular barrier. This impairs CRC trans-sinusoidal migration and reduces the risk of liver metastatic spreading. Additionally, IFNα endows LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential, supporting the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and ultimately leading to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings suggest that continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings may be useful in reducing CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.
Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant pathogens in humans, birds, and pigs worldwide. IAV infections in pigs can result in respiratory disease, reducing their health and profitability in the pork industry. In the US, IAV infection causes a significant disease burden, resulting in thousands of human deaths and billions in economic losses annually. Pigs can be infected with various IAV subtypes, including H1N1 and H3N2. Vaccination is a common measure to prevent IAV in pigs, but the virus can still evolve and infect vaccinated animals.In this study, researchers investigated IAV infections in pigs vaccinated with different vaccine types and challenge them with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains. They found that vaccinated pigs had lower virus shedding in their nasal cavities and lungs compared to unvaccinated pigs. However, there were no significant differences in shedding between the four WIV treatment groups, except for the COM/COM group, which had significantly lower Ct values in lungs compared to AUT/COM and AUT/AUT groups. Delivering a commercial vaccine boost to pigs following a single LAIV administration provided better protection and significantly decreased virus shedding in the nasal cavities and lungs.The researchers also found that the distribution of IAV receptors in the swine respiratory tract promotes IAV co-infections with strains from various hosts and facilitates virus reassortment that may result in new viruses. A mathematical model estimated an overall probability of a co-infection event in a farrow-to-finish pig farm, possibly leading to reassortment, to be 16.8%. This estimate seems reasonable given that the recurrent and co-circulation of distinct IAV subtypes within swine herds is quite common.In conclusion, IAV vaccination can limit virus replication in pigs and protect public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential. Minimizing IAV diversity should be a key strategy for One Health purposes to efficiently control IAV transmission between humans and pigs.
In this study, researchers used calcium imaging to observe the behavior of hippocampal place cells in rats as they navigated a maze. Place cells are neurons in the hippocampus that fire selectively when an animal is in a specific location in its environment. These cells are thought to play a role in spatial memory and navigation.The researchers trained rats to prefer a short path over a long path to obtain a food reward, then trained them to avoid the short path by delivering a mild foot shock. They found that place cells remapped, or changed their firing patterns, significantly more following remembered shocks (in the drug-free condition) than forgotten shocks (in the scopolamine condition). This remapping did not cause place fields to migrate toward or away from the shocked location and was similarly prevalent in cells that were responsive versus non-responsive to shocks.The researchers also found that place cells remapped significantly less in response to a neutral barrier, suggesting that place cell remapping occurs in response to events that are remembered rather than merely perceived and forgotten. They conclude that reorganization of hippocampal population codes may play a role in storing memories for aversive events. These findings support the idea that place cells do not simply encode spatial maps of environmental geometry, but also encode mnemonic information about past experiences that have occurred within an environment.
HIV-1 infection triggers an immune response that can lead to chronic inflammation and the development of reservoirs of the virus in the body. This can contribute to the progression of the disease and make it difficult to cure. A study was done to see if a drug called VX-765, which inhibits the action of a protein called caspase-1, could help to reduce inflammation and the formation of viral reservoirs in HIV-1 infected humanized mice. The study found that treatment with VX-765 reduced the levels of certain pro-inflammatory molecules in the blood, as well as the amount of viral RNA and DNA in the spleen. This suggests that targeting the inflammasome, a protein complex that plays a role in the immune response, could be a useful strategy for treating HIV-1 infection and reducing the formation of viral reservoirs. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the safety and efficacy of VX-765 in humans.
The loss of a spouse is often considered one of the most traumatic events in a person's life, but most people eventually adapt to the loss over time. Similarly, prairie voles, which form strong pair bonds similar to humans, show signs of stress after partner separation, but these symptoms also decrease over time. Researchers tested the hypothesis that extended partner separation causes pair bond-associated behaviors and transcriptional signatures to erode. They found that these behaviors persist despite prolonged separation, but opposite-sex pair bonding leads to changes in accumbal transcription that erode following prolonged partner separation. These eroded genes are associated with gliogenesis and myelination, suggesting a new role for glia in pair bonding and loss. Additionally, the researchers developed a method for isolating neuron-specific transcriptional changes, revealing dopaminergic- and steroid hormone signaling-associated gene clusters sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation. These findings suggest that partner separation erodes transcriptomic signatures of pair bonding, potentially priming the vole to form a new bond.
In this study, researchers explored the relationship between motor variability and the development of motor primitives in human infants. Motor primitives are basic patterns of coordination that allow for motor exploration and learning in developing systems. The researchers found that in human infants, there is a high level of trial-to-trial variability in the activity of lower-limb muscles in the neonatal period, which decreases as the infant approaches walking onset. This decrease in variability is associated with an increase in the number of motor primitives.The high variability in newborns can be explained by the variable activation and combination of a small number of motor primitives, suggesting that the motor system can generate trial-to-trial variability at birth, even with few primitives. As the infant approaches walking onset, more primitives are needed to explain the EMG patterns of alternated leg movements, and these primitives are activated more consistently across trials. Additionally, primitives become more selective, suggesting that toddlers develop the capacity to control fewer muscles at a time.These findings suggest that the motor system is flexible from birth, despite the existence of basic patterns of coordination. The researchers also suggest that neonatal motor primitives are plastic structures that fraction in early life to become more selective and more steadily activated as the infant matures. This study highlights the importance of considering both motor variability and motor primitives in understanding the development of the motor system in human infants.
The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium brought together researchers to analyze data on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the bacteria causing typhoid fever. This analysis included 13,000 genome sequences, the largest collection to date. The data showed that the genotype 4.3.1 (H58) had not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa and that different genotypes had independently evolved antibiotic resistance in other regions. Ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility and high-level ciprofloxacin resistance were widespread, and extensively drug-resistant typhoid had become dominant in Pakistan but had not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance had emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia. The consortium aims to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of antibiotic-resistant Typhi and inform decisions about introducing typhoid conjugate vaccines and other prevention and control strategies.
In the field of plant biology, vernalization is a process that helps flowers to bloom at the right time in spring. This is achieved by exposing the plant to long-term winter cold, which triggers a floral promotion process. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this is done through cold-mediated epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). A cold-induced antisense RNA called COOLAIR, which is transcribed from the FLC locus, plays a role in this silencing.The researchers found that C-repeat (CRT) /dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) at the 3'-end of FLC and CRT/DRE-binding factors (CBFs) are required for cold-mediated expression of COOLAIR. CBFs bind to CRT/DREs at the 3'-end of FLC, both in vitro and in vivo, and CBF levels increase gradually during vernalization. COOLAIR expression is impaired in cbfs mutants, and CBF-overexpressing plants show increased COOLAIR levels even at warm temperatures.COOLAIR is induced by CBFs during early stages of vernalization, but its levels decrease in later phases as FLC chromatin transitions to an inactive state to which CBFs can no longer bind. However, cbfs and FLCΔCOOLAIR mutants exhibit a normal vernalization response despite their inability to activate COOLAIR expression during cold, indicating that COOLAIR is not required for the vernalization process.In simple terms, the researchers found that a group of proteins called CBFs, which are activated by cold, help to promote flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana by turning on the expression of a cold-induced antisense RNA called COOLAIR. This COOLAIR RNA is important for the plant to flower at the right time in the spring. However, even if the plant cannot make COOLAIR, it can still flower at the right time in response to vernalization.
HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, can persist in the body even with antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is because the virus can hide in reservoirs in the body, such as in lymph nodes and the brain. In this study, researchers looked at HIV-1 proviral sequences in autopsy samples from up to 18 different organ systems from three study participants who had ART until their death. They used single-genome proviral sequencing to analyze the samples. The results showed that HIV-1 proviruses were present in all the analyzed tissues, including the CNS. Intact proviruses, which are capable of replicating, were found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, and periventricular white matter. Defective proviruses, which cannot replicate, were also found in all the analyzed tissues except for the thalamus in one participant. Clonal proliferation of infected cells, where an identical viral DNA copy is passed on to daughter cells, was observed in the basal ganglia, frontal lobe, thalamus, and periventricular white matter. These findings suggest that deep analysis of HIV-1 reservoirs in distinct tissues is important for advancing HIV-1 cure strategies.
Circadian clocks are biological timekeepers that regulate daily rhythms in gene expression, physiological functions, and behavior in many organisms, including flies and humans. These clocks are controlled by a process called transcriptional regulation, where certain genes are turned on and off in a daily cycle. In flies, these clocks are located in both the brain and non-neuronal tissues, and they can exhibit distinct transcriptional properties. The receptor for PDF, a circadian neurotransmitter, is critical for the function of the brain clock and loss of this receptor disrupts normal locomotor activity, but not all tissue-specific circadian clocks. Peripheral clocks in non-neuronal tissues are less stable after the loss of PDF signaling, but they continue to oscillate. Different clocks also exhibit differences in their oscillatory amplitude or their change in period, depending on their anatomical location, mutation, or fly age. A method called Locally Activatable BioLuminescence (LABL) was developed to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live, intact Drosophila. This method allows for rapid, affordable, and direct real-time monitoring of individual clocks in vivo.
Membrane trafficking pathways are important for establishing and maintaining the endosomal network. Protein sorting from the endosome is promoted by SNX-BAR-containing coat complexes, including retromer. In metazoans, retromer works with VARP to direct an endosomal recycling pathway. However, the function of the yeast VARP homolog, Vrl1, has been unclear due to an inactivating mutation. Researchers have now found that Vrl1 has features of a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms a complex with Vin1, a paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5. They named this complex VINE. The VINE complex occupies endosomal tubules and regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome. Membrane recruitment by Vin1 is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity. This research helps us understand the role of SNX-BAR coat proteins in membrane trafficking and their potential impact on human health.
The researchers studied the impact of temperature on interactions between marine fish species using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. They collected seawater samples twice a month from 11 coastal sites for 2 years in the Boso Peninsula, Japan. Using nonlinear time series analytical tools, they detected fish-fish interactions as information flow between eDNA time series, reconstructed interaction networks for the top 50 frequently detected species, and quantified pairwise, fluctuating interaction strengths. The study found that water temperature influenced fish-fish interaction strengths, and this impact varied among fish species. For instance, interaction strengths that Halichoeres tenuispinis and Microcanthus strigatus received strongly increased with water temperature, while those of Engraulis japonicus and Girella punctata decreased with water temperature. These findings suggest that not only how much neural firing occurs but also when it occurs is important for how the brain represents information. This research demonstrates a practical research framework to study the effects of environmental variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature, which would contribute to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.
Birds, or avian dinosaurs, are a diverse group with a wide variety of eggshell sizes, shapes, and colors. Eggshells are biominerals made mostly of calcium carbonate and can be well-preserved in the fossil record. This makes them valuable for studying the evolution of phenotypic changes in dinosaurs over geological time scales. However, it can be difficult to understand how eggs and eggshells evolve within a single dinosaur clade due to homoplastic similarities. Palaeognathae is one of two major clades of modern birds and includes species like ostriches, rheas, emus, cassowaries, and tinamous. These birds lay large eggs with thick eggshells and have distinctive microstructures compared to those of Neognathae, the other major clade of modern birds.A recent study used electron backscatter diffraction to analyze the detailed microstructures and crystallographies of eggshells from all major clades of Palaeognathae, as well as selected eggshells from Neognathae and non-avian dinosaurs. The study found that rhea-style eggshell appears homologous, while ostrich-style and tinamou-style morphotypes are best interpreted as homoplastic morphologies. Rhea-style eggshell represents the ancestral state of palaeognath eggshells both in microstructure and crystallography. This information is helpful for understanding the evolution of modern and extinct dinosaur eggshells and can also be useful for other disciplines where palaeognath eggshells provide a useful archive for comparative contrasts, such as palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, geochronology, and zooarchaeology.
Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are sounds used by animals for communication and navigation, and are particularly important in rodents. They have social and emotional significance and are used in various behaviors such as distress calls, courtship signals, and echolocation. USVs have been extensively studied in mice and have been shown to convey social and emotional information. Their study is important in neurodevelopmental and neurolinguistic research, and has the potential to lead to the discovery of novel drug targets for various conditions such as autism-spectrum disorder, Parkinson’s disease, stroke-induced aphasia, epilepsy aphasia syndromes, progressive language disorders, chronic pain, and depression/anxiety disorders.A new system, Hybrid Vocalization Localizer (HyVL), has been developed to localize USVs with high precision. HyVL integrates a high-resolution acoustic camera with high-quality ultrasonic microphones and is able to localize USVs with millimeter precision, which is a significant improvement over previous systems. HyVL has been used to analyze mouse courtship interactions and has found that males and females vocalize in different relative spatial positions. The system has also found that when two male mice interact with one female, one of the males takes a dominant role in the interaction both in terms of the vocalization rate and the location relative to the female. HyVL has the potential to significantly improve the precision of studying social communication between rodents and can be used in various research and clinical settings.
Muscle strength and movement in both humans and animals are due to the contraction of striated muscles, which is powered by sarcomeres. These are the force-producing units of muscles and are organized into chains called myofibrils that span the entire muscle fiber length. The sarcomeric architecture is similar in all animals, with actin and myosin filaments connected by the titin protein. Titin spans half a sarcomere in vertebrates and determines the length of the sarcomere. However, the role of titin in non-vertebrates is not well understood.A new study used nanobodies, which are small antibody fragments, to determine the precise location of the two Drosophila titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, in intact flight muscles. By combining nanobodies with super-resolution microscopy, the researchers found that Sallimus bridges across the flight muscle I-band, while Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band. Interestingly, the ends of both proteins overlap at the I-band/A-band border, which may help to stably anchor Sallimus at the myosin filament and ensure efficient force transduction during flight.This organization of the two Drosophila titin homologs differs from that of vertebrates, where a single protein, titin, spans the entire sarcomere. The staggered organization of Sallimus and Projectin in Drosophila may allow for stable transmission of mechanical tension across the sarcomere and the ruling of sarcomere length without the presence of a single protein linking the Z-disc to the M-band.In summary, this study used nanobodies and super-resolution microscopy to determine the precise location of the two Drosophila titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, in intact flight muscles. The staggered organization of these proteins in Drosophila may have functional implications for force transduction and sarcomere length regulation. This research provides new insights into the role of titin in insect muscle and could have implications for our understanding of striated muscle function in general.
The study presents a new method for measuring the elastic and viscous properties of individual cells. The method involves suspending cells in a high-viscosity fluid and pumping them through a microfluidic channel, which causes the cells to deform and rotate. By analyzing the cell's deformation and rotation, the researchers can extract the cell's viscoelastic properties. The method was found to be accurate and can be used to study the rheological behavior of different cells.The researchers found that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks. This behavior was found to be cell-cycle-dependent.The method has several advantages over existing microfluidic methods for measuring cell rheology. First, the shear stress profile inside the channel is not affected by the viscosity of the cell suspension medium, making it easier to control and measure the shear stress. Second, the fluid shear stresses remain approximately constant across the cell surface, simplifying the fluid dynamics computations. Third, most cells have undergone several full rotations before reaching the field of view, making it easier to calculate viscoelastic cell parameters.The researchers also demonstrated the use of the method to measure the viscoelastic properties of various cells, including neutrophils, and found that the activation of neutrophils is accompanied by a marked increase in cell stiffness. This process may be relevant for the progression and exacerbation of inflammatory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019.In conclusion, the study presents a new high-throughput and simple method for measuring the viscoelastic properties of cells, which can be used to study the rheological behavior of different cells and their relation to cell functions and diseases.
Mitochondria, the powerhouse of cells, are particularly important in heart function as they provide the energy needed for heart development, contraction, and repair. However, mitochondrial dysfunction is not commonly associated with isolated cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood efficiently. A study found that a rare mutation in the mitofusin 2 (MFN2) gene, called R400Q, is over-represented in individuals with clinical cardiomyopathy. This mutation is not a known cause of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A), a neurological condition. The MFN2 R400Q mutation impairs mitochondrial fusion, a critical function of MFN2, but does not affect mitochondrial motility, depolarization, or respiration like other MFN2 mutations. Instead, MFN2 R400Q is uniquely defective in recruiting Parkin to mitochondria, a crucial step in the mitophagy process, which removes damaged mitochondria. Mice with the Mfn2 R400Q mutation developed perinatal cardiomyopathy, while mice with other MFN2 mutations did not. The cardiomyopathic hearts of Mfn2 Q/Q400 mice showed signature abnormalities similar to experimental mitophagic cardiomyopathy. Cultured cardiomyoblasts and in vivo cardiomyocytes expressing MFN2 Q400 had mitophagy defects with increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. MFN2 R400Q is the first known natural mitophagy-defective MFN2 mutant, suggesting a mechanism for enrichment in clinical cardiomyopathy. This discovery highlights the importance of mitophagy in heart function and the need for further studies on genetic mitophagy defects as cardiac risk modifiers.
The study explored the impact of olfactory information during the early stages of life on the longevity of mice. Previous research suggested that mouse lifespan could be influenced by endocrine or nutritional signals in the first few weeks of life. The study found that the lifespan of female mice could be increased significantly by odors from adult females administered transiently from 3 days until 60 days of age. This effect was not seen in male mice, and it was not modified by conditional deletion of the G protein Gαo in the olfactory system. This research highlights the potential of very young mice being susceptible to influences that can have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later life, and provides a potential example of lifespan extension by olfactory cues in mice.
Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) are tools used to control specific cells in the body using chemical actuators. One such actuator is clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). However, it has been suggested that CNO may have unintended effects on sleep, as it can be metabolized back into clozapine, which is a sedating antipsychotic drug. A study was conducted to test this hypothesis by injecting CNO into mice and analyzing their sleep patterns using electroencephalography and electromyography. The results showed that CNO injections led to a dose-dependent suppression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, changes in EEG spectral power during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and altered sleep architecture similar to that seen with clozapine. These results suggest that CNO can modulate sleep, even in mice not expressing DREADD receptors, and that this effect could be due to back-metabolism to clozapine or binding to endogenous neurotransmitter receptors. Therefore, it is important to include a DREADD-free control group in chemogenetic experiments and consider electrophysiological sleep assessment as a tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators.
This text discusses a microfluidic device used for studying the chemotaxis, or movement, of microorganisms in response to chemical stimuli. The device, called a Multiplexed Chemotaxis Device (MCD), is designed to perform six chemotaxis assays in parallel on a single microfluidic chip. The MCD uses laminar flow patterning and established stop-flow diffusion methods to create a concentration gradient of chemostimulus (concentration, Ci) and buffer (C=0) solutions. When the flow is stopped, a chemostimulus gradient forms via diffusion and the movement of swimming cells in response to this gradient can be observed and recorded. The MCD is able to generate six pre-defined concentration conditions (Ci) via a serial dilution process and dispense them to each of the six observation channels for chemotaxis assays. The device is fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in two layers. The primary function of the dilution layer is to receive two fluid inputs, a base chemostimulus solution (C0) and buffer (C=0), and passively generate six pre-defined concentration conditions, which are then dispensed to each of the six observation channels for chemotaxis assays. The cell injection layer introduces a suspension of swimming microbes and a sheathing buffer solution from two corresponding inlets into the six observation regions of the dilution layer. In the observation regions, the chemostimulus solution, cell suspension, and buffer streams comprise six standard stop-flow chemotaxis assays, where each one incorporates a unique chemostimulus concentration. The initially steady flow rates stratify the three fluids in the observation region and localize the cells in a thin band in the channel center with equal width chemostimulus and buffer streams on either side. Upon halting the flow, a unique and highly reproducible chemical gradient is formed in each observation channel via diffusion. The mixing effectiveness, fluid stratification, and gradient formation were validated over a range of applied pressures and were found to be consistent across all six observation regions. This efficient two-layer architecture reduces the operational complexity of the device by decreasing the total number of fluid inlets and reduces the footprint of the microfluidic chip. The MCD has been shown to consistently and repeatably generate chemostimulus gradients, making it a valuable tool for studying the chemotaxis of microorganisms.
Neural crest cells are an essential and multipotent cell population during embryonic development. They undergo a series of processes including induction, specification, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form various tissues and structures in the body, including craniofacial structures and components of the peripheral nervous system. While the transcriptional control of these events has been well-studied, recent research has shown that post-transcriptional regulation also plays a crucial role in neural crest development.In this study, the researchers focused on Elavl1, an RNA-binding protein that has been shown to have conserved roles in neural development. Elavl1 is known to stabilize mRNA, often by associating with the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of its mRNA targets. The researchers found that Elavl1 is expressed in specified, premigratory cranial neural crest cells following establishment of the neural plate border and is retained during the onset of EMT and in early migrating cranial neural crest cells.To determine the role of Elavl1 during cranial neural crest specification, the researchers perturbed Elavl1 function using a translation-blocking antisense morpholino oligo (MO) and analyzed neural crest specification using quantitative fluorescent hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to measure expression of markers of specified neural crest at HH9. They found that perturbation of Elavl1 led to premature neural crest delamination, as well as significant reduction in the expression of genes within the neural crest specification gene regulatory network (GRN). These effects were mediated by loss of Draxin, a direct mRNA target for stabilization by Elavl1.In conclusion, these data highlight the important intersection of post-transcriptional regulation with modulation of the neural crest specification GRN. This study provides further evidence for the critical role of post-transcriptional regulation in neural crest development and craniofacial morphogenesis.
Breathing is essential for life, controlled by complex neural networks and cellular mechanisms in the brainstem and spinal cord. These networks control muscle contractions to produce respiratory-related movements. At the core of respiratory circuits are Dbx1-derived interneurons, which generate the rhythm and pattern of breathing, and phrenic motor neurons (MNs), which provide the final motor output that drives diaphragm muscle contractions during inspiration. A study was conducted to understand how respiratory circuits assemble. The study found that coordinated activity of type I and type II cadherins is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output. MN- and Dbx1-specific cadherin inactivation during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. This combinatorial cadherin code is required to establish phrenic MN cell body and dendritic topography, revealing novel strategies that drive the assembly of motor circuits.
Social media platforms are known for their role in the spread of misinformation, which can have serious real-world consequences. This issue has been linked to the current incentive structure of social media, where likes and shares are not tied to the accuracy of the information being spread. A study was conducted to test if changing the incentive structure to tie social rewards and punishments to information veracity could reduce the spread of misinformation. The study found that when participants were given the option to react to posts with 'trust' or 'distrust' buttons, as opposed to traditional likes and dislikes, they were more discerning in their reactions. Additionally, when exposed to an environment where rewards and punishments were directly associated with the veracity of information, participants started sharing more true information and less false information. These findings suggest that altering the incentive structure of social media platforms to tie rewards and punishments to accuracy could be an effective way to reduce the spread of misinformation without reducing engagement. This intervention could have far-reaching implications in reducing violence, vaccine hesitancy, and political polarization.
Microtubules are vital for transporting materials within cells. They can generate force and motion by disassembling, causing protofilaments to curl outward and exert pulling force directly on kinetochores, which pull the sister chromatids apart during mitosis. Magnesium can increase the work output of these curling protofilaments, making them generate larger and more energetic working strokes. This increase in work output can be explained by lengthening the protofilament curls without changing their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. The longer the protofilament curls, the more curvature strain energy is stored in the microtubule lattice. This conservation of protofilament flexural rigidity and stored strain suggests that these biophysical properties are crucial to microtubule function in cells.
Hagfishes, a group of jawless fish, have a unique and effective defense mechanism where they produce a cloud of slimy, fibrous mucus when attacked. This slime is produced by specialized thread cells, called gland thread cells (GTCs), located in slime glands along the sides of the hagfish's body. However, recent research suggests that the origins of these slime-producing cells may be in the epidermis of the hagfish.A study of hagfish epidermis has found large intracellular threads in a type of cell that is similar to the slime-producing cells. These threads are on average 2 mm long and 0.5 microns in diameter, and the entire body of a hagfish is covered in a dense layer of these thread-producing cells. When the skin is damaged, these threads are released along with mucus, forming an adhesive, fibrous slime.Furthermore, transcriptome analysis suggests that these epidermal threads are ancestral to the slime threads and that the genes for thread production have undergone duplication and diversification in parallel with the evolution of slime glands. This research supports the idea that hagfish slime originated in the epidermis and evolved to become stronger and more voluminous as a form of defense.The slime provides hagfishes with a strong defense against predators, allowing them to survive in an environment where many other types of jawless fish have gone extinct. The fossil record for hagfishes is sparse, making it difficult to trace the evolutionary origins of the slime glands. However, the presence of similar thread-producing cells in lampreys, the closest living relatives of hagfishes, and the existence of genes related to thread production in other types of fish, suggest that these cells may have appeared before the split between jawless and jawed vertebrates.In summary, hagfishes have a unique and effective defense mechanism in the form of a fibrous slime that is produced by specialized cells called gland thread cells. Recent research suggests that the origins of these slime-producing cells may be in the epidermis of the hagfish, and that the slime evolved to become stronger and more voluminous as a defense mechanism. The slime provides hagfishes with a strong defense against predators, allowing them to survive in an environment where many other types of jawless fish have gone extinct.
This text discusses a study about a treatment for chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in rats. The treatment involves giving the rats sodium selenate for four weeks. The study found that this treatment reduced the number of seizures the rats had, improved their spatial and recognition memory, and improved their sensorimotor function. The treatment also increased the expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and reduced the levels of hyperphosphorylated tau (h-tau) in the rats' brains. Additionally, the treatment was associated with increased telomere length, which suggests that it may be helping to protect the rats' brain cells from damage. The study also used proteomics and metabolomics to identify potential markers of TLE and on the proteome and metabolome. The results showed that there were certain proteins and metabolites that were differently expressed in the rats that were treated with sodium selenate, which could be used as potential markers for TLE. Overall, the study suggests that sodium selenate may be a promising treatment for chronic TLE.
The text discusses the development of a new concept called 'Skeletal Age' to better communicate the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality to patients. Skeletal Age is defined as the sum of chronological age and the number of years of life lost due to a fragility fracture. The authors used data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register to analyze the relationship between fracture and mortality, and then translate this relationship into the 'Skeletal Age' for each fracture site. The study found that a fracture is associated with a loss of 1 to 7 years of life, with hip fractures incurring the greatest loss of life years. The authors propose the use of Skeletal Age as a new metric to assess the impact of a fragility fracture on an individual's life expectancy, which they believe will enhance doctor-patient risk communication about the risks associated with osteoporosis.
Brain extraction, or the process of separating brain tissues from non-brain tissues in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, is a crucial step in analyzing brain structure and function. Conventional tools have been developed for human brain data, but there is a lack of generalizable methods for extracting brain tissues for multimodal MRI data from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. A flexible and generalizable method for extracting brain tissue across species would allow for more efficient analysis and comparison of experimental results.A domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network, named the Brain Extraction Net (BEN), was proposed to address this issue. BEN was evaluated on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six MR scanners with various magnetic field strengths. The results showed that BEN outperformed conventional toolboxes in terms of robustness, accuracy, and generalizability. BEN not only provides a generalized solution for extracting brain tissue across species but also significantly improves the accuracy of atlas registration, thereby benefiting downstream processing tasks.In conclusion, BEN is a novel and automated deep-learning method that can efficiently and accurately extract brain tissues across species, modalities, and MR scanners. This method has the potential to greatly improve the analysis of neuroimaging data in both preclinical and clinical applications.
Heme can be an essential source of iron for certain organisms, including the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This fungus has proteins called Frp1 and Frp2 that are important for using heme as an iron source. These proteins are located on the surface of the fungal cell and can move to the plasma membrane in the presence of heme. Frp1 and Frp2 are similar to other proteins called FREs, which help reduce iron to a form that can be taken up by cells. However, Frp1 and Frp2 are different from most FREs and lack a certain part of the protein that is usually involved in binding to iron. Frp1 and Frp2 are also located near other proteins called CFEM hemophores, which can bind to heme and transfer it across the cell wall to be used as a source of iron. Frp1 and Frp2, along with the CFEM hemophores, form a functional complex that allows the fungus to take up extracellular heme and use it as an iron source. This complex evolved from FREs to enable extracellular heme uptake.
Cholera is a dangerous disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which has been responsible for pandemic outbreaks since 1960. The bacterium can survive in changing environments due to sensory proteins like ToxR and ToxS, which react to environmental stimuli like bile acid and induce survival strategies such as bile resistance and virulence regulation. A recent study has analyzed the structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS and their interaction with bile acid. The researchers found that a bile binding pocket of ToxS is only properly folded upon binding to ToxR, and that there is an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. This finding supports the link between ToxRS and VtrAC-like co-component systems and highlights the significance of ToxRS as the only experimentally determined structure within this superfamily. The conservation of ToxRS across various Vibrio species suggests that conserved residues in the ToxS barrel and the more diverse ToxR sensory domain play a crucial role in environmental sensing. Understanding the mechanisms governing ToxRS’s environmental sensing capabilities could provide a promising tool for disrupting this vital interaction and inhibiting Vibrio’s survival and virulence. This finding has far-reaching implications for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings.
The hippocampus, a brain structure essential for memory and navigation, shows functional differences along its length, with different parts linked to various cognitive functions. A recent study used MRI to examine the anatomical connections between the cortical mantle (the outer layer of the brain) and the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus.The researchers first identified the cortical areas most strongly connected to the hippocampus, then mapped where these areas preferentially connected within the hippocampus. They found that specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus were associated with different cortical inputs/outputs, indicating both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity within the human hippocampus.These findings, detailing how the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus varies along its length, could enhance our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain. However, more research is needed, as current knowledge of human hippocampal connectivity is mainly inferred from studies in rodents and non-human primates, which may not fully reflect human patterns of connectivity.
The text discusses a study on the role of STING, a protein involved in the body's immune response, in neurodegenerative diseases. The researchers used mice with a specific genetic variant of STING, N153S, to investigate its effects. They found that these mice had increased systemic inflammation, as indicated by higher levels of certain markers. Additionally, these mice had a higher number of activated microglia and astroglia, two types of cells involved in the immune response in the brain. The researchers also observed that the dopaminergic neurons, which are particularly sensitive to stress and are important for movement and mood regulation, were reduced in number in these mice. Furthermore, there was a lower density of dopaminergic axon terminals and a lower concentration of dopamine in the striatum, a region of the brain that is important for movement and reward processing. These findings suggest that chronic activation of the STING pathway can lead to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The researchers also found that targeting the STING pathway could be beneficial in Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.In conclusion, the study suggests that chronic activation of the STING pathway can cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which could be a factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. Targeting the STING pathway could be a potential therapeutic approach for these diseases.
This text is about a study on immunology and inflammation, specifically in the field of cancer biology. The study found that tumor cells can evade immunotherapy by forming unique transient cell-in-cell structures, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. These formations are mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells, and inhibiting certain factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. This work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism which enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity. The study also suggests that this biological process is a central mechanism through which tumor cells escape T-cell immunity and give rise to relapsed tumors.
Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others. This study explores how marmosets, a highly social primate species, process Frith-Happé animations, which are animations featuring geometric shapes that move in a way that suggests intentional or mental state-related actions. Both marmosets and humans were found to exhibit longer fixations on one of the triangles in the ToM condition, but marmosets did not show the same pattern of longer overall fixation duration on the ToM animations as identified in humans. However, both species activated extensive and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM versus Random animations, suggesting that marmosets differentiate between these scenarios similarly to humans. This study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities, shedding light on potential similarities and differences in ToM processing between marmosets and humans.
Stem cells and regenerative medicine are areas of study that focus on how stem cells can be used to create new cells, tissues, or even organs in order to replace or repair those that are damaged due to disease or injury. In a research paper, the processes of stemness-to-differentiation transitions in fly neural stem cells, or neuroblasts, were studied. The researchers found that a transcription factor called FruitlessC (FruC) plays a key role in regulating gene activity during this transition. FruC binds to specific regions of DNA and negatively regulates gene expression, or the process by which the instructions in DNA are used to create proteins, by promoting low-level enrichment of a repressive histone mark called H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. This repressive histone mark prevents genes from being turned on. The researchers propose that this mechanism of fine-tuning gene transcription is likely conserved from flies to humans. This means that the findings from this study could potentially be applied to understanding human stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.
"Neutrophils, typically known for combating infection, have a unique and unexpected role in the disposal of dead cells in the liver. In the human liver, neutrophils are the main type of cell responsible for clearing dead liver cells, a process that typically goes unnoticed due to its efficiency. In a series of experiments, researchers discovered that neutrophils penetrate and digest dead liver cells from the inside, a process called ""perforocytosis."" This mechanism is different from the classical engulfment of dead cells by other types of phagocytes, such as macrophages.The researchers found that in both human and mouse livers, apoptotic hepatocytes (dead liver cells) were occupied by neutrophils, but not associated with macrophages. This observation was consistent in liver samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic hemangioma, and even in healthy livers. In contrast, Kupffer cells, liver-resident phagocytes, were rarely associated with apoptotic hepatocytes.Furthermore, the researchers found that the phagocytosis of dead cells by neutrophils consisted of three sequential steps: initial invading or burrowing, phagocytosis and detachment, and complete digestion. The entire process took about 4-7 minutes. In vitro experiments confirmed that human neutrophils were able to penetrate and burrow inside apoptotic hepatocytes, causing them to decrease in size. Similar results were observed with NCTC cells and HL60 cells. In contrast, neutrophils showed little response to normal, non-apoptotic cells.These findings suggest that neutrophils play a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by clearing dead cells in the liver. Defects in this key housekeeping function of neutrophils may contribute to the development of autoimmune liver disease. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of understanding the various roles of different types of cells in the body and how they interact with each other to maintain health."
In simple terms, the text discusses a series of studies on how the brain controls movement. The researchers used various techniques to trace the pathways that signals take from the brain to the muscles. They found that the signals follow specific patterns and that the timing and pattern of muscle activation is crucial for complex movements. The researchers used a virus to trace the pathways and found that the virus spread to specific types of neurons in the spinal cord. These neurons are involved in controlling flexor and extensor muscles, which are responsible for bending and straightening joints. Contrary to what they expected, the neurons controlling flexor and extensor muscles were not organized in specific domains, but were intermingled. This suggests that the control of muscle movements is more complex than previously thought and that the brain may use other methods, such as the timing of signals, to control movement. The researchers also discuss the importance of the position of neurons in the circuit and how this may affect the function of the circuit. They used different methods to trace the pathways and found that the distribution of flexor and extensor premotor interneurons was not segregated, which is surprising as previous studies had suggested otherwise. Overall, the studies highlight the complexity of motor control and the need for further research to fully understand how the brain controls movement.
Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is a powerful tool used to study brain-wide functional connectivity. However, rsfMRI signals can be affected by systemic physiological changes such as respiration. Respiration can cause both artifacts and neural activity changes in rsfMRI signals. While the artifactual effects of respiration on rsfMRI are well-characterized and can be removed by standard preprocessing methods, the neural component of the respiration-rsfMRI relationship is largely unexplored.A new study in rats found that slow respiration variations are associated with neural activity changes in the brain. Specifically, there is a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrophysiological signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Slow respiration variations are also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network, which is mediated by gamma-band neural activity. This respiration-related brain network disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced, confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network.These findings suggest that respiration is associated with neural activity changes in the brain, which represents a novel component in the respiration-rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts. This study opens up new avenues for investigating the interactions between respiration, neural activity, and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions. Future studies can build on this analysis to see if phase-amplitude coupling and phase coding also support neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.
Bats that primarily hunt for ground-dwelling insects, called greater mouse-eared bats, use two different hunting strategies. They either swoop down to the ground to grab their prey (gleaning) or they catch insects mid-air (aerial hawking). These bats, which are specialized for gleaning, have a preference for hunting on the ground, but they are actually more successful in catching prey mid-air. Despite this, they spend more time hunting on the ground and catch more prey overall.The researchers used miniaturized biologging devices to track the hunting behavior of these bats and recorded over 3900 attacks on prey. They found that most bats used a mix of both hunting strategies, but four bats exclusively hunted on the ground and two bats only hunted in the air. The bats attacked food more often on the ground, but the success rate was much higher in the air. This led to an average of 25 aerial and 29 ground insects caught per bat per night.The researchers also used GPS tracks from seven bats to investigate the factors that influence foraging success. They found that the bats caught prey in separate foraging bouts that were dedicated to either hawking or gleaning. Almost half of all aerial prey was captured during commuting. The bats were more successful in gleaning above open fields compared to forest habitats, but the attack rates and success ratios were consistently high and unaffected by habitat when capturing insects in the air.The researchers used DNA metabarcoding of feces to estimate prey types and sizes. They found that the bats target a wide range of prey species, with ground prey being 2.5 times longer and 20 times heavier than aerial prey. These findings suggest that the bats obtain on average between 30-61 kJ/night per bat during the hunting seasons of July to August.In conclusion, the researchers found that despite the fact that greater mouse-eared bats are specialized for gleaning, they actually have a higher success rate in catching prey mid-air. However, they spend more time hunting on the ground and catch more prey overall. The bats use separate foraging bouts for each hunting strategy and are more successful in gleaning above open fields compared to forest habitats. The bats target a wide range of prey species, with ground prey being much larger than aerial prey. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the hunting behavior and energetics of these specialized bats.
Handedness, or the preference for using one hand over the other, is a universal trait in humans, with the majority being right-handed. However, the evolution of human right-handedness and its relationship to primate handedness has been a topic of debate for decades. A new study aimed to clarify this by compiling data on hand preferences for object manipulation in 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans.The study found that human right-handedness is an extreme among anthropoids and that population-level handedness is rare among primates. Additionally, the direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates and did not strongly correlate with any biological predictors or phylogeny. However, patterns of hand preference strength were variable and showed signatures of both ecology and phylogeny. Terrestrial primates tend to display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species. These results challenge popular ideas on primate handedness evolution and suggest a potential adaptive benefit of disparate lateralization strength in primates.Furthermore, human lateralization patterns do not align with trends found among other anthropoids, suggesting that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species. The study provides the first quantitative phylogenetic perspectives on hand preferences in monkeys, apes, and humans, highlighting the variability and rarity of population-level hand use biases in primates.
Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a genetic disorder that affects both the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. It is caused by a deletion of a region on chromosome 7 that contains 26-28 genes. People with WBS have mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, a hypersocial phenotype, and poor short-term object-recognition performance. They also have a hypersociable phenotype, characterized by uninhibited social interactions and a reduced response to social threat. This is opposite to the social phenotype of autism spectrum disorders, which is characterized by lack of social interest and deficits in social communication. The congenital cardiovascular phenotype in WBS is the major source of morbidity and mortality, and is characterized by elastin arteriopathy, supravalvular aortic stenosis, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and hypertension.In a study, researchers investigated the potential of targeting the endocannabinoid system (ECS) as a treatment for WBS. The ECS is a homeostatic modulatory system involved in a variety of physiological functions at both central and peripheral levels. It is composed of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands or endocannabinoids, and the enzymes involved in the synthesis and inactivation of these ligands. In the study, the researchers found that subchronic administration of the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 normalized relevant behavioral phenotypes in CD mice including social behavior and memory alterations. Additionally, this treatment partially restored cardiovascular deficits and cardiac transcriptional alterations found in the WBS CD model. These results suggest that modification of the endocannabinoid signaling could be a novel therapeutic strategy worth evaluating in the context of WBS.
In living organisms, development from embryo to adult involves passing through different stages, each with distinct characteristics. In humans, this progresses from childhood to puberty and adulthood, while in holometabolous insects like fruit flies, it transitions from larva to pupa and then to adult. This process is regulated by specific transcription factors. In flies, the larval, pupal, and adult stages are determined by the sequential expression of chinmo, Br-C, and E93 transcription factors. Chinmo is a key player in this process. It promotes growth in both larval and imaginal tissues, but in different ways: larval growth is Br-C independent, while imaginal growth requires Br-C. The absence of chinmo during metamorphosis is crucial for proper adult differentiation. Surprisingly, contrary to its known role as a pro-oncogene, Br-C and E9
Co-substrate cycling is a common occurrence in metabolism, where a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions. This cycling creates interconnections within metabolism, spanning either multiple reactions in a single, linear pathway or multiple pathways that are independent or branching from common metabolites. For example, in glycolysis, ATP is consumed in reactions mediated by the enzymes glucose hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, and is produced by the downstream reactions mediated by phosphoglycerate and pyruvate kinase. In the nitrogen assimilation pathway, the NAD+/NADH pair is cycled by the enzymes glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase. Many other cycling motifs can be identified, involving metabolites from the central carbon metabolism or metabolites that are usually referred to as co-substrates, such as NADPH, FADH2, GTP, and Acetyl-CoA and their corresponding alternate forms. The total pool-size involving all the different forms of a cycled metabolite can become a conserved quantity, becoming a ‘conserved moiety’ for the rest of the metabolic system. Supporting this, temporal measurement of specific co-substrate pool sizes shows that ATP and GTP pools are constant under stable metabolic conditions, but can rapidly change in response to external perturbations. Co-substrate cycling can introduce a fundamental constraint on reaction flux, and in the case of single reaction and short linear pathways, a mathematical expression of this constraint can be derived, showing that it relates to the pool size and turnover rate of the co-substrate. Analyzing measured fluxes, it was found that several of the co-substrate featuring reactions in central carbon metabolism carry lower fluxes than expected from the kinetics of their primary enzymes, suggesting that these reactions might be limited by co-substrate cycling. In addition to its possible constraining role, co-substrate cycling can also act as a regulatory element, where control of co-substrate pool size can allow control of flux dynamics across connected or branching pathways.
Stem cell research is crucial for understanding regenerative medicine. Articular chondrocytes, which make up the cartilage in joints, have an unclear origin and differentiation mechanism. This study aimed to identify the mechanism of articular chondrocyte differentiation during development. The researchers found that NFATc1, a gene widely expressed in various physiological and pathological processes, is a crucial regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation. NFATc1-expressing cells were mainly located in the flanking region of the joint interzone during knee development and generated almost all articular chondrocytes but not chondrocytes in the limb growth-plate primordium. NFATc1-expressing cells displayed prominent capacities for colony formation and multipotent differentiation. The transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene was negatively regulated by NFATc1, which characterizes articular but not growth-plate cartilage progenitors during development and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation. These findings provide novel insights into the identity and origin of articular cartilage progenitors and reveal the fundamental function of NFATc1 in determining physiological articular chondrocyte differentiation.
Photosystem II (PSII) is a key enzyme in oxygenic photosynthesis, responsible for converting energy from sunlight into chemical energy. It typically contains 35 chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and 2 pheophytins a (Phe) and is found in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and most cyanobacteria. However, some cyanobacteria have adapted to use different types of chlorophyll to capture lower energy, far-red light. For example, Acaryochloris marina has Chl-d replacing all but one of its 35 Chl-a, while Chroococcidiopsis thermalis has just 4 Chl-f and 1 Chl-d and 30 Chl-a. It was predicted that these far-red PSII would lose efficiency and/or resilience to photodamage, but a study comparing enzyme turnover efficiency, forward electron transfer, back-reactions, and photodamage in Chl-f-PSII, Chl-d-PSII, and Chl-a-PSII found that all types of PSII have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover. However, the modified energy gaps on the acceptor side of Chl-d-PSII favor recombination, leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII. The acceptor-side energy gaps in Chl-f-PSII are tuned to avoid harmful back reactions, favoring resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage. These adaptations allow PSII to function in lower energy environments, but come with functional penalties.
Osteocytes, the long-living cells in the bone matrix, play crucial roles in maintaining skeletal homeostasis. They regulate bone formation, bone resorption, and bone marrow hematopoiesis. During aging, the cell lineage commitments change, leading to an imbalance between myeloid-lymphoid hematopoiesis and adipo-osteogenic differentiation. This change is believed to be regulated by cellular senescence, a state characterized by cell proliferation arrest, altered metabolism, and apoptosis resistance. However, the precise role of senescence in regulating lineage cell fates is unclear.A study was conducted using a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes by the expression of diphtheria toxin subunit α in DMP1-positive osteocytes. The results showed that partial ablation of DMP1-positive osteocytes caused severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan in these animals. Osteocytes reduction altered mesenchymal lineage commitment, resulting in impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that hematopoietic lineage was mobilized toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes, while the lymphopoiesis was impaired with reduced B cells in the osteocyte ablation mice. The acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells was the underlying cause.In summary, this study shows that osteocytes play critical roles in regulation of lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow through mediation of senescence. The reduction of osteocytes and their function may result in the detrimental impact in altering lineage cell fates and specifications in bone marrow, leading to severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and kyphosis.
The text discusses a study that uses the Escherichia coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) to understand the molecular mechanisms behind complex adaptations. The LTEE involves 12 replicate populations of E. coli adapting to a carbon-limited medium for 50,000 generations. The study found that despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations have similar gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Most expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level, with very few translational changes. Mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations are deepened, and the repeatability of evolution is provided. The study used RNA-seq and Ribo-seq to profile the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes after 50,000 generations of evolution in the LTEE. They aimed to answer five fundamental questions, including whether evolved lines show similar transcriptomic and translatomic changes, how changes in cell size affect changes in absolute expression levels, whether changes in gene expression at the translational level buffer, augment or match changes at the transcriptional level, what classes of genes or pathways are altered in the evolved lines, and if mutations responsible for parallel changes in gene expression across replicate populations can be identified.
CD133 is a protein commonly viewed as a marker for cancer stem cells, and is associated with drug resistance and cancer recurrence. In this study, researchers found that in mouse liver regeneration, certain hepatocytes form clusters and divide, even when proliferative signaling is impaired. These hepatocytes are characterized by upregulated CD133 and are negative for other progenitor cell markers. This CD133 expression is also seen in various cancer cell types from multiple animal species when proliferative signaling is inhibited. CD133 is located on intracellular vesicles, named 'intercellsome', that migrate between cells and are enriched with mRNAs. These intercellular mRNA exchanges may compensate for intracellular signal deficit in various cell types. CD133-deficient cells are more sensitive to proliferative signal inhibition in livers and intestinal organoids. These findings suggest a mechanism of intercellular communication for compensating intracellular signal deficit in various cell types.
This text is about a study that aimed to find drug candidates for maintaining photoreceptor survival in retinal diseases, specifically Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) type 10, which is caused by mutations in the cilia-centrosomal gene CEP290. The researchers used retinal organoids differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of rd16 mice and LCA10 patients. They identified five non-toxic positive hits, including reserpine, which maintained photoreceptor development and survival in rd16 organoids. Reserpine also improved photoreceptors in retinal organoids derived from LCA10 patients and in rd16 mouse retina in vivo. Further investigation revealed that reserpine partially restored the balance between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system in patient organoids and rd16 mouse retina. The study highlights the impact of proteostasis in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies and provides new insights for treatments of retinal neurodegeneration.In simpler terms, the researchers were looking for drugs that could help save photoreceptor cells in retinal diseases, specifically LCA type 10. They tested many different drugs on retinal organoids (mini-retinas) grown in the lab from stem cells of mice and patients with LCA10. They found that reserpine, a drug that has been used to treat hypertension and schizophrenia, was effective in maintaining photoreceptor development and survival in both mice and patient organoids. Additionally, reserpine helped restore the balance between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which are important for maintaining cell health. These findings suggest that reserpine or similar drugs could be useful for treating LCA10 and possibly other retinal diseases.
Bees are exposed to various plant compounds, including amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in almonds and other fruits. While amygdalin can be toxic to bees, they are still able to consume it in low concentrations, and it may even provide protection against parasites and pathogens. However, the metabolic pathway of amygdalin in bees is not well understood. While bees have some enzymes that can break down plant metabolites, they have fewer detoxification genes compared to other insects. Therefore, bees may rely on their gut microbiota to help metabolize potentially toxic molecules. In this study, researchers found that amygdalin can be metabolized by both bees and members of their gut microbiota. Specifically, they identified strains of Bifidobacterium, Bombilactobacillus, and Gilliamella that can degrade amygdalin. Different strains use different degradation mechanisms, with some producing prunasin as an intermediate, while others break down the glycosidic bond linking the two glucose residues. The study highlights the importance of both host and microbiota in metabolizing dietary plant metabolites, and suggests that further research is needed to fully understand the metabolic pathway of amygdalin in bees and other insects.
Candida albicans is a harmful fungus that causes severe invasive candidiasis, a common and deadly infection in hospitalized patients. This fungus releases a toxin called candidalysin (CL) that damages the cell membrane. However, it's unclear how CL forms pores in the membrane. A research team used various techniques to study CL and discovered that CL forms pores in a unique way. First, CL assembles into polymers in a solution before it inserts into the membrane to form pores. A mutated version of CL, G4W, cannot form polymers and fails to damage cellular membranes. The researchers also found that pores come in two forms: simple depressions and more complex pores with rims. The rimmed pores are likely formed by CL assembled in an alternate orientation and may represent a maturation mechanism that stabilizes pore formation for more robust cellular damage. This research helps us understand how CL damages membranes and identifies CL polymerization as a potential target for treating candidiasis.
The text is a medical research paper that explores the role of contextual factors, such as personalization, in the effectiveness of interventions for various conditions. The paper describes two studies that tested the effectiveness of a placebo analgesia machine in reducing pain. In the first study, participants who were told that the machine was personalized to their genetics and physiology reported more relief in pain intensity than the control group. In the second study, similar effects were found for pain unpleasantness. Additionally, several personality traits moderated the results. The findings suggest that presenting a treatment as personalized can increase its effectiveness, and that this effect could be harnessed in precision medicine research and clinical practice. It is important to consider the role of contextual factors, in addition to pharmacological ingredients, when studying and implementing personalized treatments.
Neuroscientists have studied how shared lineage affects the way neurons connect with each other in circuits. In mammal and fly brains, neurons that come from the same origin tend to form specific patterns of connectivity. In mammal cortex, sister neurons connect with each other in a shared microcircuit, while in flies, sister neurons with different levels of Notch expression develop distinct identities and form separate circuits. Notch-differentiated sister neurons have been found in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but it is unclear if they integrate into shared or distinct circuits. A recent study looked at how sister V2a (NotchOFF) /V2b (NotchON) neurons in the zebrafish integrate into spinal circuits. They found that these sister neurons have similar axonal trajectories but receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. These results suggest that Notch-differentiated circuit integration also occurs in vertebrates.
Homeostatic plasticity is a crucial mechanism that allows the brain to maintain stable activity levels in the face of changing conditions. This process can be destabilizing if activated inappropriately or excessively, such as during prolonged activity deprivation, which can lead to rebound hyperactivity and seizures. A set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms enable neuronal networks to rebalance activity following perturbations, such as those that occur during development, learning, or disease. These mechanisms can alter the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons, as well as the strength and number of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.Homeostatic plasticity can be maladaptive if it overshoots or is activated inappropriately, and it is not well understood how its strength is normally constrained. A study found that a family of transcription factors called the PARbZIP family, which includes Hlf, Tef, and Dbp, are involved in constraining the strength of homeostatic plasticity and preventing life-threatening seizures. These transcription factors act as transcriptional activators and are typically oscillatory in peripheral tissue, but not in the brain outside of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Loss of these factors has been associated with epilepsy, suggesting they are important in regulating network activity.In summary, homeostatic plasticity is a crucial mechanism for maintaining stable activity levels in the brain, but if activated inappropriately or excessively, it can lead to destabilizing effects such as seizures.

The text is about a study that investigates the role of genetics and genomics in developmental biology, specifically focusing on the development of the respiratory system in mice. The study identifies crucial progenitor cells in the developing respiratory buds, marked by the expression of SOX9 and ID2, which give rise to all types of lung epithelium. The researchers used RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq techniques to analyze the gene expression and chromatin accessibility of SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) during embryonic development.The results showed widespread changes in chromatin accessibility, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements, between E11.5 and E16.5. Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference identified a common SOX9+ progenitor GRN, implicating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+ progenitor cells. The researchers confirmed this finding by performing a conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mice, resulting in an expansion of the SOX9+ EPC population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation.The study highlights the importance of chromatin state in integrating various developmental and external stimuli into comprehensive cellular programs and maintaining progenitor cell identities. It underscores the significance of chromatin accessibility changes in establishing and maintaining cellular identity during development. Additionally, the study demonstrates the power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development and identifying new roles for gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways in lung epithelial development.In simpler terms, the researchers studied the development of the respiratory system in mice and identified critical cells that give rise to all types of lung tissue. They used advanced techniques to analyze the activity and accessibility of these cells' genes and found that a specific signaling pathway plays a crucial role in their development. The study emphasizes the importance of gene activity and accessibility in the development of organ systems and highlights the significance of these findings for understanding lung diseases and development.
Working memory (WM), a crucial cognitive domain often affected in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), has typically been studied using the slot model hypothesis. However, recent studies suggest that the resource model, which assumes dynamic allocation of WM resources, provides more accurate predictions in WM assessment. This study investigated WM dysfunction in MS using two continuous reproduction paradigms: Memory-Guided Localization (MGL) and an Analog Recall Task with sequential presentation. The results showed an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS. Sequential paradigms were better at distinguishing healthy controls from relapsing-remitting MS, while MGL was more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes. Computational modeling determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error contributed to WM dysfunction in MS. This study provides a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit and new insights into the organization of the WM system in the MS population.
Nociception is a fundamental process that animals, including flies and mammals, have developed to detect and avoid potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. In flies, this process is regulated by a neuropeptide called Drosulfakinin (DSK), which is a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) found in mammals. DSK plays a role in negatively regulating nociception, as demonstrated by the thermal hypersensitivity seen in flies with a deletion mutation in the dsk gene. This hypersensitivity was rescued by introducing a genomic fragment containing the wild-type dsk gene, confirming that dsk is responsible for the thermal hypersensitivity. Furthermore, DSK activates two G-protein coupled receptors, CCKLR-17D1 and CCKLR-17D3, which are orthologous to the mammalian CCK receptors, CCKAR and CCKBR. Deletion mutants for CCKLR-17D1 and CCKLR-17D3 exhibited thermal hypersensitivity, indicating that DSK signaling is involved in the negative regulation of thermal nociception. These receptor mutants were found to be hypersensitive to suprathreshold thermal stimuli, thus hyperalgesic, but not allodynic, as their responses to subthreshold temperatures were indistinguishable from controls. Additionally, DSK is expressed in specific brain neurons, MP1 and Sv, and not in the gut, in flies. These neurons are involved in regulating nociception in larvae. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system.
Plants often produce chemicals to defend against parasites, but some fungi have found ways to overcome this defense. A study found a fungus that can grow on a plant called Aglaia, despite the plant producing rocaglates, which are toxic compounds. This fungus has an amino acid substitution in a protein that normally binds to rocaglates, allowing it to resist the toxic effects of these compounds. This fungus is a new species within the Ophiocordyceps genus and was named Ophiocordyceps sp. BRM1. Similar fungi have been found to infect ants and cause a 'zombie' phenotype. This fungus was also found to have a survival advantage when grown on cucumber plants treated with rocaglates, demonstrating its ability to resist the antifungal properties of these compounds. These findings suggest that not only how much neural firing occurs, but also when (or specifically at what phase) it occurs is important for how the brain represents information. Future studies could explore if phase-amplitude coupling also supports neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation.
Psychophysical methods are a crucial part of psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, as they provide precise and reliable measurements of the relationship between external stimuli and internal sensations. These methods typically involve a series of trials where participants respond to stimuli with binary decisions. However, these tasks can be tedious, leading to variability in responses. A solution to this is continuous psychophysics, which involves continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli. This approach has been shown to require less time and be more suitable for untrained subjects. However, current analysis methods for continuous psychophysics do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task. Here, the authors introduce a computational analysis framework based on Bayesian inverse optimal control that recovers perceptual thresholds and estimates subjects’ action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. This shows the importance of including acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and intrinsic costs of behavior in experiments seemingly only investigating perception.
This text is a research paper in the fields of computational and systems biology and neuroscience. It discusses a model for how the brain makes decisions in dynamic environments, where conditions can change during the course of a single decision. The model is based on normative principles, which means it is derived from a set of rules or laws. The model suggests that decisions are made by accumulating evidence and using thresholds that respond to and anticipate changes in evidence quality or reward. The model is then tested using a 'tokens task', where human subjects are shown a group of tokens and must predict which target will have the most tokens by the end of the trial. The results show that the normative model provides a better account of human behavior than fixed-threshold models or urgency-gated models. This suggests that the brain is able to adapt its decision-making strategies to changing conditions in order to maximize reward.
Biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem services that support economic prosperity and quality of life. However, biodiversity is declining rapidly due to human activities. Freshwater ecosystems have suffered the greatest biodiversity loss. While studies have shown that biodiversity loss leads to loss of ecosystem functions, there is a lack of holistic studies, especially in freshwater ecosystems, to understand the impact of environmental factors on biodiversity. To address this, researchers have developed a conceptual framework using artificial intelligence to establish links between biodiversity dynamics and abiotic changes. In this study, the framework was applied to a freshwater ecosystem with a known history of human impact over 100 years. The researchers used community-level functional biodiversity measured with multilocus metabarcoding and explainable network models with multimodal learning to establish correlations with biocides and climate change records. The study found that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed over time without returning to its original state. Insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. The study suggests that high-throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends over species-focused ecological surveys can identify environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions.
The brain receives outdated sensory information due to delays in neural transmission and processing. To perceive motion, the brain may predict the position of moving objects using past trajectory information. A study using high temporal resolution EEG data found that during early stimulus-evoked activity, moving objects' position representations were activated earlier than those of unpredictable flashes, aligning them with real-time positions. This indicates that predictability of straight trajectories allows full compensation for neural delays early in stimulus processing, but delays still accumulate across later stages. This predictive encoding mechanism helps compensate for neural delays in visual input reaching the visual cortex and subsequent cortical processing, allowing the brain to keep up with an ever-changing world.
The human brain's unique ability to derive knowledge from language inputs is significant because it allows us to understand symbols and words beyond just sensory experiences. A study was conducted to understand how language experience affects the way semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain. The researchers used early deaf adults who were born to hearing parents and had reduced early exposure and delayed acquisition of any natural human language as their sample, with early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth as the control group.The researchers measured neural responses in a semantic judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups using fMRI. The deaf group with reduced early language exposure showed reduced semantic sensitivity in both multivariate pattern and univariate analyses in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL) compared to the control group. These results provide positive, causal evidence that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the dATL, highlighting the roles of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences.In summary, the study found that language experience plays a crucial role in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences. Early language exposure is essential in developing semantic representations in the brain, and reduced or delayed language exposure can lead to reduced semantic sensitivity in the left dATL. This research contributes to our understanding of how the human brain processes and stores semantic knowledge, particularly in individuals with reduced early language exposure.
In this study, researchers explored the role of replay, a phenomenon where neurons in the hippocampus reactivate in a sequence similar to their activation during a behavioral episode, in memory processing. They focused on dorsal CA1 place cells in rats and found that these cells can modulate their firing rates between replay events of two different contexts. This modulation mirrors the same pattern observed during behavior and can be used to discriminate between contexts, suggesting that there are two complementary neural representations available for memory processes. Rate representation, or the modulation of a neuron's firing rate, has been shown to carry additional information beyond place representation, which is based on the sequential activation of place cells. However, the detection of reactivation events is typically based on the firing rate of place cells, making it necessary to control for the effects of firing rate at the point of event detection. The researchers found that replay can reinstate a near replica of neural activity previously driven during behavior, providing a richer, more complete memory trace. This study highlights the importance of both place and rate representations in memory processing and suggests that replay could serve a larger role in memory consolidation.
This text is about a study of mitochondrial diseases and male infertility. Mice with a certain genetic mutation, called PARL-deficient mice, develop early testicular atrophy and a complete arrest of spermatogenesis. This means that the mice cannot produce sperm. The spermatocytes, or cells that develop into sperm, in these mice have abnormal mitochondria and defects in the electron transfer chain, which is important for producing energy in cells. These defects cause the spermatocytes to die through a process called ferroptosis, which is a regulated form of cell death characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. The researchers think that these mitochondrial defects and ferroptosis may be important in the development of some mitochondrial diseases and male infertility. Further research is needed to confirm this.
FGF21 is a hepatokine with lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties that has been identified as a promising potential therapeutic to treat NASH. It is specifically expressed in the liver and adipose tissue, and its levels increase in metabolically compromised states such as obesity and NAFLD. In a study, mice were fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFCD) to induce NASH, and an adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) vector expressing codon-optimized murine Fgf21 was used to induce liver-specific FGF21 overexpression. The results showed that FGF21 overexpression prevented fat mass gain under NASH-inducing dietary conditions, reduced body weight, and decreased weights of white and brown adipose tissues. FGF21 also prevented the HFCD-induced lipid overload in brown and subcutaneous adipose tissues, increased uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) expression, and protected against HFCD-induced adipocyte enlargement and formation of crown-like structures in gonadal white adipose tissue. FGF21 also suppressed the HFCD-induced expression of adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1 (Adgre1), encoding the macrophage surface marker F4/80, and pro-inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfa), interleukin-1β (Il1b), and monocyte attractant chemokine C–C motif ligand 2 (Ccl2). Additionally, FGF21 increased plasma adiponectin levels, indicating that it prevents HFCD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction during NASH development. FGF21 normalized fasting plasma glucose compared to LFCD, which was accompanied by lower glucose excursion after an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. FGF21 also strongly and consistently reduced fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) levels throughout the experimental period compared with LFCD- and HFCD-fed mice. FGF21 prevents the HFCD-induced increase in circulating glucose and reduces circulating TG levels beyond those observed in LFCD-fed mice. FGF21 not only prevented HFCD-induced liver weight gain but even reduced liver weight to a level lower than that of LFCD-fed mice. Furthermore, FGF21 abolished the HFCD-induced increase in steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning. Therefore, FGF21 completely prevented the HFCD-induced large increase in the NAFLD activity score and prevented collagen accumulation in the liver. In conclusion, FGF21 protects against HFCD-induced hepatosteatosis, steatohepatitis, as well as fibrogenesis.
Neurophysiology is the scientific study of the brain's electrical activity.

Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to long-term neurological issues like encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy, even after the virus is cleared from the system. A study was conducted to understand the molecular changes in the brain during IAV infection. Mice were infected with H1N1 virus, and the hypothalamus was extracted at different time points. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was used to identify transcriptional changes in cell populations. The most significant transcriptional response was observed at 3 days post-infection (dpi), with a strong downregulation of genes across all cell types. Specific changes included general immune processes being mainly impacted in microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and most neuronal cell populations downregulating genes contributing to energy homeostasis and protein translation. These changes might be preventive measures taken by neuronal cells to avoid viral replication and attack by immune cells, while microglia shift their activity to increase surveillance of their surroundings. This study sheds light on the potential neuronal and non-neuronal molecular changes during an IAV infection, providing insights into the long-term neurological disturbances seen in some patients.
This text is about a study in computational and systems biology, specifically looking at cancer biology. The researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study how apical-basal cell polarity loss links to plasticity in Drosophila ovaries. They found that when a gene called Lgl is knocked down, it causes invasive multilayering of the follicular epithelia. By analyzing the transcriptomes of these cells, they found that a signaling pathway called Keap1-Nrf2 is enriched in the multilayered cells. Manipulating the expression of Keap1 and Nrf2 regulates the invasiveness of the cells. These findings describe the earliest transcriptomic changes within dysplastic cells of the follicular epithelia with polarity loss in its cells and identify novel regulatory pathways that determine plasticity in the invading tumor. This research helps us understand how tumors form and how they might be treated.
This text is about a study that explores how people learn from social and non-social information sources. The study found that people have more confidence in social information sources, like advice from others, and are less likely to change their minds when making judgements based on social information. This was true even when the social and non-social information sources were equally accurate. The study also found that people's beliefs about the accuracy and uncertainty of a predictor, whether social or non-social, can affect how they adjust their judgements. Participants were more confident and set smaller intervals when they believed a predictor to be accurate, but only for non-social predictors did they set larger intervals when they were more uncertain about the predictor's accuracy. Overall, the study suggests that people have different learning processes for social and non-social information, and that these differences may be due to how people perceive and remember social information.
Synaptic communication is a process that involves the release of neurotransmitters from a presynaptic terminal to transmit information to a postsynaptic terminal. This process is triggered by action potentials that cause calcium ions to enter the presynaptic terminal, leading to the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and the release of neurotransmitters. A high calcium sensitivity is needed for fast responses to the transient calcium transient, and the fusion rate depends on the fourth or fifth power of the intracellular calcium concentration. The energy for synaptic vesicle fusion is provided by the assembly of the neuronal SNARE complex, which consists of vesicular synaptobrevin/VAMP and plasma membrane-bound SNAP25 and syntaxin proteins. Synaptotagmin, a vesicular protein, confers calcium sensitivity to synaptic vesicle fusion by interacting with the SNAREs. Synaptotagmin contains two cytosolic, calcium-binding domains, C2A and C2B, of which the C2B domain has been shown to be essential for synchronous neurotransmitter release. This domain contains two calcium-binding sites and a second binding site that allows it to bind to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI (4,5) P2) located in the plasma membrane. A third site is also involved in both SNARE- and membrane contacts. The syt C2B domain can induce close membrane-membrane contact, stable vesicle-membrane docking, and dynamic vesicle-membrane association upon calcium influx into the cell. The intrinsic calcium affinity of the isolated syt C2B domain is low, but binding of the C2B domain to PI (4,5) P2 drastically increases its calcium affinity. This positive allosteric coupling between the binding sites for calcium and PI (4,5) P2 promotes dual binding of calcium/PI (4,5) P2, which is involved in fusion and is central to syt’s function in triggering calcium-induced exocytosis. A mathematical model has been developed to describe the stochastic binding/unbinding reactions at the level of individual syts and stochastic synaptic vesicle fusion events. The model predicts that each C2B domain engaging in dual calcium/PI (4,5) P2 binding lowers the energy barrier for fusion by ~5 kBT.
Sauropterygia was a diverse group of Mesozoic marine reptiles that lived from the Early Triassic to the Late Cretaceous. They are traditionally divided into two major lineages: Placodontia and Eosauropterygia. Placodonts had short necks and skulls, and crushing palatal dentition used for feeding on hard-shelled invertebrates. Eosauropterygians, on the other hand, had elongated necks and skulls with pointed dentition suitable for capturing fast-moving prey. Recently, a new study has found that saurosphargids, a small clade of armored marine reptiles, are actually nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. This finding supports the idea that not only how much neural firing occurs, but also when it occurs (specifically, at what phase) is important for how the brain represents information. This discovery also highlights the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa.
This text is about a study that looks at the relationship between genetics, genomics, epidemiology, and global health, specifically in relation to smoking and DNA methylation. The study uses data from the Netherlands Twin Register, which has DNA methylation data for over 3000 whole-blood samples from twins and their families. The researchers focused on monozygotic twin pairs, who are genetically identical, to study the reactiveness of DNA methylation in blood cells to smoking and the reversibility of methylation patterns upon quitting smoking. They found that in pairs discordant for current smoking, there were 13 differentially methylated CpGs, or specific locations on DNA where methyl groups are added, between current smoking twins and their genetically identical co-twin who never smoked. These CpGs are located in genes that encode subunits of a calcium voltage-gated channel and G protein, which interact with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, suggesting that methylation levels at these CpGs might be reactive to nicotine exposure. All of these CpGs have been previously associated with smoking in unrelated individuals, and data from monozygotic pairs discordant for former smoking indicated that methylation patterns are to a large extent reversible upon smoking cessation. The study also found that differences in smoking level exposure for monozygotic twins who are both current smokers but differ in the number of cigarettes they smoke are reflected in their DNA methylation profiles. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that DNA methylation level in human blood cells is reactive to cigarette smoking.
The text describes a study that compares the output of the retina in awake, anesthetized, and ex vivo states. The researchers found that the retina in awake mice had faster kinetics, a larger dynamic range, and higher firing activity compared to the anesthetized and ex vivo retinas. These results suggest that the retina employs dense coding in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as has been often assumed from ex vivo studies. This study highlights the importance of understanding retinal function in fully physiological in vivo conditions and clarifies the retina's role in processing visual information.
Cell fixing is a crucial step in various biological techniques, often used to preserve a snapshot of biomolecular transactions in living cells. Paraformaldehyde (PFA) is a common fixative due to its small size and reactivity with various biological entities. However, PFA fixation can both enhance and diminish liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behaviors in fixed cells. Fixing cells in the presence of glycine, a molecule that modulates fixation rates, can reverse the fixation effect. A kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein-protein interactions suggests that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and the difference between fixation rates of different proteins. Simulations and live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments support this model, indicating that a fast overall rate of fixation relative to protein-protein interaction dynamics can minimize fixation artifacts. These findings reveal that PFA fixation changes the appearance of LLPS from living cells and caution against interpreting in vivo phase separation based solely on immunofluorescence imaging of fixed cells.
Researchers have developed a bladder-chip model to study urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC forms communities called IBCs inside bladder cells during early stages of UTIs, making it difficult to assess their responses to host stresses and antibiotic therapy. The bladder-chip model co-cultures umbrella cells and bladder microvascular endothelial cells under flow in urine and nutritive media, mimicking bladder filling and voiding mechanically. Using this model, they found that rapid recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection leads to swarm and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, but does not prevent IBC formation. Antibiotic elimination of bacteria within IBCs is delayed, and in some instances, does not occur at all. During recovery periods, rapid proliferation in a significant fraction of IBCs reseed new foci of infection through bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation. These insights highlight the importance of IBCs in bacterial persistence and their potential impact on antibiotic treatment efficacy.
The study focuses on the cellular amination network, which is essential for generating the nitrogenous building blocks of life. The network involves glutamate, a vital amino acid produced by ammonium (NH4+) assimilation via canonical biosynthetic routes. The research aims to understand the network's flexibility by constructing an Escherichia coli glutamate auxotrophic strain that allows systematic study of amino acids serving as amine sources.The study identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, new amine sources like β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine were added to the transaminase network, and d-amino acid dehydrogenase (DadA) was discovered as an intracellular amino acid sink. Furthermore, ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine were introduced.The research showed that the amination network is highly flexible, with transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points. This flexibility could benefit industrial applications, such as screening and optimization of ammonium assimilation and transamination reactions using E. coli as a versatile bacterial chassis.In summary, this study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, with multiple amine sources and transaminase promiscuity. The findings provide valuable insights into the nitrogen metabolism of E. coli, with potential applications in various industrial processes.
Coral reefs, home to a diverse range of marine life, depend on the relationship between corals and algae called Symbiodiniaceae. These algae live inside corals and provide them with nutrients through photosynthesis. A new study focused on the algae Breviolum sp., which is a member of the Symbiodiniaceae family, and its response to changes in pH levels.The researchers found that when the pH level decreases, the algae release more monosaccharides, such as glucose and galactose, into the environment. This release is due to the degradation of the algal cell wall, specifically the cellulose component, which is triggered by the low pH levels. The researchers also found that a cellulase inhibitor, PSG, can suppress the secretion of monosaccharides.These findings suggest that the algal symbionts release monosaccharides into the symbiosome, the compartment within host cnidarian cells, by degrading their cell walls. The researchers propose a multi-pathway hypothesis where both the current accepted model of monosaccharide secretion and the new pathway of cell wall degradation and monosaccharide release coexist. They believe that this new pathway allows the algae to compensate for retarded cell cycle progression caused by photosynthesis-limiting conditions.The study also highlights the potential evolutionary advantage of acidic symbiosomes for cnidarian hosts as they promote environmental responses of algal symbionts, enabling monosaccharides to be efficiently secreted within the organelle. Understanding the mechanism of energy transfer in coral reef ecosystems has wider implications for understanding how energy is shared over the entire coral reef ecosystem. Future research can focus on determining the contribution of each pathway to the energy supply of the host and the potential use of cellulase gene knock-out for testing the hypothesis.In summary, the study reveals a new insight into how carbon is provided by symbiotic algae to the coral reef ecosystem and highlights the role of cell wall degradation and monosaccharide release in the energy transfer in coral reef ecosystems.
Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a genetic kidney disorder that can lead to end stage renal disease in children and young adults. It is caused by mutations in over 25 different genes, including INVS/NPHP2. In the mouse, global knockout of Invs leads to renal fibrosis and cysts. However, it is unclear how different cell types contribute to this disease and the relationship between epithelial cysts and interstitial fibrosis. In this study, the researchers generated and characterized cell-type-specific knockout mouse models of Invs. They found that epithelial-specific knockout of Invs resulted in renal cyst formation and severe stromal fibrosis, while stromal-specific knockout of Invs had no observable phenotypes. This suggests a significant role of epithelial-stromal crosstalk in NPHP. Additionally, they found that concomitant removal of cilia partially suppressed the phenotypes of the Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre mutant kidney, indicating a significant interaction of cilia and Invs function in vivo. Furthermore, they found that the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) reduced cyst burden, decreased cell proliferation and ameliorated kidney function decline in Invs mutant mice. This suggests the possibility of repurposing VPA for NPHP treatment.
The Steller’s sea cow, an extinct marine mammal, had a unique mutation in its hemoglobin that may have helped it adapt to the cold waters of the North Pacific. This mutation, a substitution of lysine for asparagine at position 82 of the beta-type hemoglobin chain, is unusual because it is invariant among other characterized mammalian hemoglobins. This mutation is predicted to have altered multiple aspects of hemoglobin function, including its oxygen-binding properties and sensitivity to temperature. However, it is unclear whether this mutation alone or in combination with other amino acid replacements contributed to the lower hemoglobin-oxygen affinity of this extinct species relative to other sirenians. Additionally, this mutation may have had antagonistic pleiotropic effects, such as increasing the effect of temperature on hemoglobin-oxygen binding and release, which could have potentially impeded oxygen delivery to the limbs and flukes in this species. Overall, the Steller’s sea cow provides an interesting case study in the evolution of hemoglobin function and thermal biology.
The text discusses the use of Drosophila cells as a model for studying biological processes. Drosophila cell lines are useful for this purpose because they are homogenous, scalable, and have distinct transcriptomic profiles even when derived from the same tissue. The paper describes the use of RasV12, an activated form of the Ras protein, to provide a proliferation and survival advantage to Drosophila cells in culture. By expressing RasV12 in a lineage-restricted manner, the researchers were able to generate cell lines with specific cell-type characteristics, such as glial, epithelial, and muscle cells. These cell lines were then analyzed using transcriptome analysis to confirm their cell-type specific gene expression. The cells and associated data are available from the Drosophila Genomic Resource Center. This resource allows other researchers to access and build upon this work.In conclusion, the paper demonstrates the usefulness of Drosophila cell lines as a model for studying biological processes and the potential of using RasV12 to generate specific cell types in culture. The availability of these cell lines and data through the Drosophila Genomic Resource Center will allow for further study and discovery in this field.
Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are specialized cells with multiple motile cilia that help move fluids across surfaces in the body. These cilia are templated by centrioles, and MCCs produce many more centrioles than other cells through a process called centriole amplification. This process is regulated by a protein called PLK4, which is essential for centriole duplication in other cells. However, recent studies have questioned the role of PLK4 in centriole assembly in MCCs. To address this, researchers used genetically engineered mice and found that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Cells that fail centriole amplification do not expand their surface area and accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins. These results suggest that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs, and that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events in MCCs.
The human endometrium, a complex tissue, goes through regular cycles of wounding and repair. During menstruation, the surface epithelium is shed and the tissue is restored without scarring. A study was conducted to investigate the origin of the cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. The study used a mouse model and three transgenic lines of mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to identify a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells, and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. A lineage tracing strategy was used to confirm this hypothesis. The study found that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response.
Microbiology and genomics research studies the adaptation of microbes in fluctuating environmental conditions. A study found that a phase variation system in Burkholderia thailandensis creates a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous population by altering genomic architecture through RecA-mediated homologous recombination between a pair of IS2-like elements. This system represents a rare example of IS element-mediated evolution, allowing the bacteria to expand their lifestyle repertoire by amplifying a chromosomal region that provides a selective advantage under specific growth conditions. This mechanism highlights the role of genetics and genomics in microbial adaptation and evolution.
Translation, the process of creating proteins from genetic information, is a crucial process in biology. In bacteria like E. coli, this process is carried out by the translation machinery, which includes components like transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. These components can have multiple copies or functions that are redundant, meaning they can perform similar tasks. A study was conducted to understand the impact of reducing this redundancy on the fitness of E. coli.The researchers manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of E. coli by deleting certain tRNA genes, tRNA modifying systems, and rRNA operons in various combinations. They found that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful but becomes costly under nutrient limitation. This cost stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate, and therefore varies as a function of the maximum growth rate attainable in a given nutrient niche. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. These effects are also contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing. Overall, the study indicates both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species’ evolutionary history with feasts and famines. This suggests that the redundancy in these translation components is not just beneficial, but essential for the survival of the species in different environments.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an explosion of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data, with more genomes of this virus sequenced than any other organism. This data can be used to create a phylogenetic tree, which shows the evolutionary history of the virus and can help identify transmission events and new variants. However, existing tools for exploring phylogenies don't scale well to the size of the SARS-CoV-2 datasets. To address this, researchers have developed Taxonium, a new tool that uses web-based technologies to allow exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser. Taxonium can be run locally or from a server and can link each node to associated metadata. It has been used to explore a tree of five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and is available for use with other datasets at taxonium.org.
RNA molecules can be found in specific parts of a cell due to interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). While we often know the details of these interactions in one type of cell, this information may not apply to other cell types. A study was done to see if RNA/RBP interactions that regulate RNA localization in one cell type also do so in other cell types. The researchers used a technique called Halo-seq to determine the spatial distribution of RNAs across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells. They found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. By using reporter transcripts and single-molecule RNA FISH, they found that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5' UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. These findings suggest that there are conserved mechanisms of RNA localization and a predictable, underlying code for RNA localization that can be applied to vastly different subcellular locations and cellular morphologies.
Aging is often associated with a loss of cell type identity and an increase in transcriptional noise, but it's unclear if this is a fundamental property of aging. To study this, a new computational toolkit called Decibel was created to implement four commonly used methods for quantifying age-related transcriptional noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. A new computational method called Scallop was also developed to quantify the membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. When these tools were applied to seven aging datasets, there was large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging. Instead, age-associated changes in cell type composition, particularly of immune cells, were consistently found in the lung. These results suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated, and future studies should focus on the cell type-specific changes and cell type composition of aged organs. Despite numerous attempts at measuring transcriptional noise in aged tissues, challenges remain, including differences in the definition of transcriptional noise and computational methods used to quantify it, a focus on single datasets of different tissues and cell types, and little attention given to the variability of cellular composition in aged organs.
This text is about a study that explores the use of WILD-seq, a new platform for lineage tracing at the single-cell transcriptomic level, to understand how tumors respond to chemotherapy. The researchers applied WILD-seq to study syngeneic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models and found that an enrichment of clones with high levels of NRF2 signaling, which helps protect against oxidative damage, is a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. They also found that these NRF2-high, taxane-resistant lineages are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation as a result of L-asparaginase treatment, and that they adapt to this second line intervention by up-regulating de novo asparagine synthesis by increasing asparagine synthetase (Asns) expression. These findings suggest that high levels of NRF2 signaling, which is also observed in patients following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, promotes both resistance to chemotherapy and sensitivity to asparagine deprivation, and warrant the exploration of L-asparaginase as a therapeutic modality in solid tumors.
DMRT1 is a gene that is widely conserved in many species, including mammals, and has been identified as a testis-determining factor in some non-mammalian vertebrates. In mammals, the TDF is the SRY gene, which is carried on the Y chromosome. However, DMRT1 has been shown to have a role in testis determination in mammals as well. In rabbits, DMRT1 is expressed in both XX and XY fetal gonads before sexual differentiation. In XY fetuses, DMRT1 and SRY are expressed in partially overlapping territories in the medullary part of the gonad, and somatic cells expressing both of these genes differentiate into Sertoli cells. When DMRT1 is abolished in rabbits using CRISPR/Cas9, XY fetuses develop ovaries instead of testes, indicating that DMRT1 is required for testis differentiation. Additionally, germ cells fail to undergo meiosis and follicles do not form in XY and XX DMRT1-null ovaries, leading to female infertility. It is also suggested that DMRT1 mutations may be involved in different human pathologies, such as 46, XY DSD and male and female infertility. Overall, these findings indicate that DMRT1 is involved in testis determination in mammals and is also required for female fertility.
Obesity, a global health issue, is caused by various factors including high-fat diets and genetics. A study using the fruit fly, Drosophila, found that an enzyme called CTPS, which helps make a molecule called CTP, is crucial for body weight and resistance to starvation. The study found that a high-fat diet increased the amount of CTPS and elongated structures called cytoophidia in fat cells. CTPS in fat cells is necessary for weight gain, as reducing its activity did not affect body weight. The flies with less CTPS in their fat cells also had a shorter survival rate when starved. This suggests that CTPS in fat cells plays a role in storing energy, possibly in the form of lipids. The study also found that reducing CTPS in fat cells prevented body weight gain and restricted adiposity in flies fed a high-fat diet. These findings suggest that CTPS in fat cells may be a target for treating obesity and related metabolic diseases.
In the field of developmental biology, researchers are studying how germ layers in vertebrates are patterned by secreted Nodal signals. Nodal signals are thought to pattern the germ layers by binding to a complex of Type I/II Activin receptors and the co-receptor Tdgf1. However, it is unclear if receptor binding can also affect the distribution of Nodals themselves through the embryo. Additionally, it is unknown which of the putative Acvr paralogs mediate Nodal signaling in zebrafish. Researchers have identified and characterized several Type I (Acvr1) and Type II (Acvr2) homologs in zebrafish and found that, except for Acvr1c, all receptor-encoding transcripts are maternally deposited and present during zebrafish embryogenesis. They generated mutants and used combinatorial morpholino knockdown and CRISPR F0 knockout approaches to assess compound loss-of-function phenotypes. They discovered that the Acvr2 homologs function partly redundantly and partially independently of Nodal to pattern the early zebrafish embryo, whereas the Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b redundantly act as major mediators of Nodal signaling. By combining quantitative analyses with expression manipulations, they found that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) responses are crucial for the body's defense against viral infections. These responses are tightly controlled and involve the production of IFN-Is by certain cells in the body. These cells, known as first responders, produce IFN-Is upon viral detection, which in turn triggers further IFN-I production in other cells. The regulation of the early phase of IFN-I responses, during which first responders are activated, is of particular interest because it is thought to orchestrate population-wide IFN-I signaling and establish systemic antiviral protection. However, it is unclear whether the decision for a cell to become an IFN-I producer during the early phase is a stochastic process, driven by random host-intrinsic factors, or a deterministic process, driven by predetermined host-intrinsic factors. A study using a murine fibroblast model found that the percentage of first responders was remarkably similar to what has been observed in other cell types and systems. The study also found that epigenetic drugs and transiently heritable fates, rather than stochasticity, drive responsiveness in these cells. Additionally, cell density was shown to play a role in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing. These findings challenge the idea that stochasticity is the primary factor driving early IFN-I responses and suggest that deterministic, transiently heritable fates play a significant role. These insights have the potential to improve IFN-mediated immune therapies and advance the understanding of cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses and other immune signaling systems.
Microtubules (MTs) are crucial structures in a cell, made up of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers. There are several types of tubulins, and in Drosophila, there are four α-tubulin genes, with αTub84B and αTub84D being very similar, while αTub67C is distinct. Tubulins can undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as glutamylation and glycylation, which involve adding one or more glutamic acids or glycines to the tubulins. These PTMs can affect MT interaction with different microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motors.In this study, the researchers focused on the function of TTLL5, an enzyme that catalyzes glutamylation, in Drosophila oogenesis. They found that TTLL5 is required for the normal glutamylation of the ovarian αTub84B/D but not for αTub67C. Additionally, TTLL5 is essential for the proper distribution of Kinesin heavy chain, cytoplasmic streaming during late oogenesis, and fine-tuning the localization of the Staufen protein. Furthermore, TTLL5 promotes the pausing of mitochondria during anterograde axonal transport in wing nerves. The researchers also showed that the GT335 antibody could be used to monitor Drosophila TTLL5 activity, as the antibody signal is specific and can be reduced or absent in TTLL5 mutants but reappears in rescued ovary extracts.In summary, TTLL5 plays a crucial role in the glutamylation of specific α-tubulin isotypes and has significant in vivo importance for various cellular functions involving microtubule transport.
GenESPACE is a tool used in genomics and evolutionary biology to study the patterns and processes of molecular evolution. It integrates conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. This utility has been demonstrated by dissecting presence-absence, copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of biological organization: spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes. GenESPACE has been used to study the evolution of chromosome structure, find candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, and test hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. It helps in distinguishing orthologs, which arise from speciation events, and paralogs, which arise from sequence duplications. In some systems, this is a simple task where most genes are single copy. However, in other systems with gene copy number (CNV) or presence-absence variation (PAV), more robust analyses are required. The physical position of homologs offers a second line of evidence that can help overcome challenges posed by WGDs, tandem arrays, heterozygous-duplicated regions, and other genomic complexities. Synteny, or the conserved order of DNA sequences among chromosomes that share a common ancestor, is a typical feature of eukaryotic genomes. In some taxa, synteny is preserved across hundreds of millions of years of evolution and is retained over multiple WGDs. Like chromosome-scale synteny, conserved gene order collinearity along local regions of chromosomes can provide evidence of homology, and in some cases enable determination of whether two regions diverged as a result of speciation or a large-scale duplication event. Integrating synteny and collinearity into comparative genomics pipelines also physically anchors the positions of related gene sequences onto the assemblies of each genome. GENESPACE represents networks of genes that share a common ancestor and represents these networks as a ‘pan-genome annotation’. It has been used to explore gene family evolution in flowering plants, mammals, and reptiles.
"Bacteria often exist in communities made up of multiple species, and the interactions between these species can be either beneficial or harmful. One common community found in clinics is composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which can have negative effects on human health. These two species can coexist in certain environments, such as in the human body, and previous research suggests that this may be due to altered gene expression or mutations. However, little is known about how the growth environment can influence the co-existence of these two species. A study was conducted to examine this by using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation. The researchers found that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. Specifically, they found that changing the carbon source in growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, which they call ""absolute growth"". They found that as a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture. This is due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. The relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. These findings suggest that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature, provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations."
This text discusses the development of a framework for capturing knowledge about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions between different species, specifically for the Pathogen-Host Interactions (PHI) database. The framework includes a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen-host interaction data at different levels, including the host, pathogen, strain, gene, and genotype. The concept of a multispecies genotype, or 'metagenotype', is introduced to capture changes in the disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility due to gene alterations. The framework is used for the PHI-Canto, a community curation tool for use by publication authors. The text also discusses the importance of capturing this knowledge in the face of increasing amounts of biological data being generated and published, as well as the importance of manual biocuration in capturing information about function and phenotype in databases and knowledge bases.
Genetic variation in enhancers, which are regions of DNA that control gene transcription, can significantly contribute to differences in human traits. A study used F1-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice to identify thousands of enhancers with allele-specific transcription factor (TF) binding and/or activity. The researchers found that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. They also observed that the AP-1 family of TFs, specifically Fos and Jun, are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function. These findings provide insight into how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.
In this study, researchers identified a protein called NINL as a key component of the antiviral immune response in humans. NINL is a part of the dynein activating complex, which is involved in the intracellular transport machinery of the cell. The researchers found that NINL has evolved under recurrent positive selection, particularly in its cargo-binding region, indicating that it may be involved in host-pathogen interactions. They demonstrated that cells lacking NINL have an impaired response to interferon, a signaling molecule that helps the body fight off viral infections. Additionally, they found that proteases from diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. These findings suggest that NINL plays an important role in the antiviral response and is a target of viral antagonism. The researchers also highlight the potential of using signatures of host-virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.
Actin is a crucial protein for the normal function of eukaryotic cells, and small differences in its structure determine how it interacts with other proteins. Researchers have now determined the high-resolution structures of four types of actin - skeletal muscle α-actin, cardiac muscle α-actin, ß-actin, and γ-actin - in their natural state. These structures reveal specific conformations of the N-terminus of each actin type that change when myosin binds to them, creating unique interfaces. These findings provide important insights into how the structure of actin relates to its function and can help us understand the normal physiology of the cytoskeleton.
Transgenesis, or the introduction of foreign DNA into genomes, is a crucial tool for genetic analysis and engineering. While it's widely used in single-cell models, its application in multicellular systems is limited due to the difficulty of introducing exogenous DNA into the germline. This bottleneck has hindered large-scale exploratory experiments in animals. To address this, researchers have developed a new method called Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences (TARDIS).TARDIS is a two-step process. First, experimentally introduced sequence libraries are incorporated into individuals, followed by the extraction and integration of individual sequences into engineered genomic sites. This results in thousands of genetically unique transgenic individuals from a single transformed individual. The researchers demonstrated the power of this system using Caenorhabditis elegans, increasing transformation yields up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods.The TARDIS approach has several advantages. It allows for the creation of a large set of individually barcoded lineages and transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries. It also increases transformation yields and can be adapted to any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated.In summary, TARDIS is a significant development in the field of transgenesis. It overcomes the limitations of current transgenesis methods by increasing transformation yields and adaptability, making it a powerful tool for large-scale exploratory experiments in multicellular systems.
Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria go through a complex journey from the cytosol to their final destination in the outer membrane. This process involves multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes that help translocate and assemble OMPs. These helpers often form large protein assemblies, but they are not well understood due to experimental challenges. A new study uses a deep learning pipeline, AF2Complex, to identify protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and apply it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. The study finds expected and unexpected interactions, and predicts atomic structures for these protein complexes, explaining experimental observations and providing insights into how OMPs are translocated, folded, and quality controlled. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.
Dopamine (DA) neurons are important regulators of brain functions such as movement, motivation, and reward-dependent learning. These neurons are located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and project to the ventral striatum (vSTR) and dorsal striatum (dSTR), respectively. DA neurons have a complex axonal structure with a large subset of non-synaptic release sites and a smaller subset of synaptic terminals. Molecular mechanisms regulating the connectivity and neurochemical identity of DA neurons are not well understood. A study suggests that neuroligins, trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, regulate both DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission. However, the contribution of their major interaction partners, neurexins (Nrxns), is unexplored. In this study, mice with conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::NrxnsKO) were used to test the hypothesis that Nrxns regulate DA neurotransmission. The results showed that DAT::NrxnsKO mice exhibited normal basic motor functions but had an impaired locomotor response to the psychostimulant amphetamine. In line with an alteration in DA neurotransmission, decreased levels of the membrane DA transporter (DAT) and increased levels of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) were detected in the striatum of DAT::NrxnsKO mice, along with reduced activity-dependent DA release. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings revealed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of these mice. These findings suggest that Nrxns act as regulators of the functional connectivity of DA neurons.
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, which require mobile phone ownership, are being explored in Africa to increase access to healthcare. A study was conducted to estimate the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 African countries, identify the relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic, and quantify inequities in ownership. The study focused on basic mobile phones (BPs) and smartphones (SPs), and used nationally representative data from 44,224 individuals in 3
The text is a research paper about a study on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large group of people from the UK. The study measured the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two groups of people, one group of 4256 individuals from TwinsUK and another group of 4622 individuals from ALSPAC, during April and May of 2021. The study also measured antibody levels in a follow-up group of 3575 individuals from TwinsUK from November 2021 to January 2022. The researchers found that people who had received more vaccinations had higher antibody levels compared to those who received fewer vaccinations. They also found that older people, people with certain health conditions, and people who were on the UK “Shielded Patient List” had higher antibody levels. The study also found that antibody levels were higher in individuals who had received a third vaccination, with less variation between individuals, compared to levels for those with fewer vaccinations. The median anti-Spike antibody levels in individuals who had received a third vaccination were over 10-fold higher than for individuals after second vaccination. The antibody level distribution after third vaccination was also narrower, with smaller scale-factor differences between those with median and lowest levels, compared to earlier vaccination. These results suggest that a third vaccination can provide a strong and sustained immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
