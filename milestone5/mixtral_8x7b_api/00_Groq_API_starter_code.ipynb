       "'The evolutionary origins of hypoxia-sensitive cells that trigger amniote respiratory reflexes, specifically carotid body glomus cells and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), have been a mystery. Some researchers have suggested a homology between glomus cells, which are neural crest-derived, and the hypoxia-sensitive neuroepithelial cells (NECs) of fish gills, whose embryonic origin is unknown. NECs have also been compared to PNECs, which differentiate in situ within lung airway epithelia. However, a study using genetic lineage-tracing and neural crest-deficient mutants in zebrafish, as well as physical fate-mapping in frog and lamprey, has found that NECs are not neural crest-derived, but endoderm-derived, like PNECs, whose endodermal origin has been confirmed. The study also discovered neural crest-derived catecholaminergic cells associated with zebrafish pharyngeal arch blood vessels. Based on these findings, the study proposes a new model for amniote hypoxia-sensitive cell evolution: endoderm-derived NECs were retained as PNECs, while the carotid body evolved via the aggregation of neural crest-derived catecholaminergic (chromaffin) cells already associated with blood vessels in anamniote pharyngeal arches. This research provides important insights into the development and evolution of hypoxia-sensitive cells and the respiratory system.'"
