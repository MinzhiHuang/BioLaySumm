 In a recent study, researchers evaluated the performance of two in-house MAC-ELISA assays and compared them to a commercially-available CTK lateral flow rapid test and EUROIMMUN IFA assays for the detection of anti-Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) IgM. The study used sera from two outbreaks in Singapore, one in January 2008 and the other in May-to-September 2008. The viruses from these outbreaks were related to the ECSA genotype and had different amino acid residues at position 226 of the E1 glycoprotein, with alanine in the January outbreak strain and valine in the May-to-September outbreak strain.The study found that the sensitivities of the two PCR protocols were also tested and the probe-based real time RT-PCR method was found to be 10 times more sensitive than the SYBR Green method. The findings suggest that the two strains of CHIKV using variants A226 and 226V resulted in variation in sensitivities of the assays evaluated. The observed difference in antigen efficacy could be due to the amino acid substitution differences in the viral E1 and E2 envelope proteins, especially the E1-A226V substitution.The evaluation demonstrates the importance of appraisal of different diagnostic assays before their application in clinical and operational settings. The study also highlights the need for continued research to improve diagnostic tools for CHIKV and other infectious diseases.
 West Nile virus (WNV) has been present in North America since 1999, primarily maintained in enzootic cycles between mosquitoes and birds. House sparrows (HOSPs) are a highly competent host for WNV, contributing to its spread across the U.S. However, recent studies suggest that HOSPs' competence for the early WNV strain (NY99) has decreased significantly over time. This decrease in competence may indicate that HOSPs have developed resistance to this early strain. Additionally, recently isolated WNV strains generate higher peak viremias and mortality in contemporary HOSPs compared to NY99. These findings suggest that opposing selective pressures in both the virus and avian host have resulted in a net increase in the level of host competence for currently circulating WNV strains in North American HOSPs.
 Trachoma, a leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide, is a neglected tropical disease that affects impoverished populations where access to treatment and running water is limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates the SAFE strategy to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020. Mass drug administration (MDA) of antibiotics is a component of the SAFE strategy, but it can be costly and results in many uninfected individuals receiving treatment. In this study, researchers explored alternative, targeted approaches to reduce the use of antibiotics and make trachoma control more cost-effective.The researchers analyzed data on the prevalence of ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and active trachoma disease among 4,436 individuals from two communities in The Gambia and two communities in Tanzania. They used an age- and household-structured mathematical model to analyze the data and found that targeting treatment to households with active trachoma was as effective as and significantly more cost-effective than mass treatment when antibiotics were not donated. The cost per incident infection averted ranged from $1.5 to $3.1 for MDA, from $1.0 to $1.7 for household-targeted treatment assuming equivalent coverage, and from $0.4 to $1.7 if household visits increased treatment coverage to 100% in selected households.The researchers concluded that targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma has the potential to be a cost-effective trachoma control measure, but further work is needed to assess if costs can be reduced and to what extent the approach can increase the treatment coverage of infected individuals compared to MDA in different settings. Limiting MDA to children was not as effective in reducing infection as the other targeted distribution strategies.
 In the complex process of embryonic development, multicellular animals are shaped through cell proliferation, cell rearrangement, and apoptosis. Once development is complete, tissue architecture is maintained through balanced rates of cell proliferation and loss. To better understand the underlying systems features of morphogenesis in multicellular animals, researchers took an in silico approach by evolving digital organisms using artificial evolution. These organisms exhibited distinct embryonic and homeostatic phases, and despite evolving in the absence of selection pressure for wound healing, all organisms rapidly recovered from severe wounds. The most robust regenerative response was observed in an organism with a stratified tissue-like architecture. An evolutionary analysis revealed that the ability to maintain form in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation was a result of the evolution of development itself. The exceptional robustness of this organism to surface injury was found to result from an upward flux of cells, driven in part by stable niches at the tissue base. These findings suggest that many robust systems properties observed in real organisms, including scar-free wound-healing in well-protected embryos and the layered tissue architecture of regenerating epithelial tissues, may be by-products of the evolution of morphogenesis rather than the direct result of selection.
 Pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells and primordial germ cells (PGCs), have the ability to give rise to all fetal and adult cell lineages. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of these cells is crucial for directing their differentiation and reprogramming. In this study, researchers analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and PGCs and identified genes that are upregulated in pluripotent cells both in vitro and in vivo. These genes are enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair.To identify the regulatory motifs that control gene expression within these clusters, the researchers developed a novel algorithm called CompMoby. This algorithm combines the strategies of comparative genomics with DNA sequence segmentation to identify sets of motifs in the upstream regions of coregulated genes. Using CompMoby, they identified motifs that are statistically overrepresented in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells and highly conserved across multiple mammalian species. They demonstrated that several of the predicted motifs are novel regulatory elements of gene expression in mouse and human ES cells.Furthermore, they showed that the transcription factor NF-Y binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species.
 Influenza viruses are primarily carried by migratory waterfowl around the world, but it is unclear if these birds perpetuate highly pathogenic (HP) H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses. A study was conducted from 2001 to 2006 in wild ducks in Alberta, Canada, and in shorebirds and gulls at Delaware Bay (New Jersey), United States, to examine the frequency of exchange of influenza viruses between the Eurasian and American virus clades. Influenza viruses belonging to all known subtypes were detected, but H14 and H15 were not found. HP Asian H5N1 subtypes were not detected, and there was no evidence of their circulation in adult mallard ducks. The H16 subtype was detected in American shorebirds and gulls but not in ducks. An unusual cluster of H7N3 influenza viruses was found in shorebirds and gulls that was able to replicate well in chickens and kill chicken embryos. Genetic analysis of 6,767 avian influenza gene segments and 248 complete avian influenza viruses supported the notion that the exchange of entire influenza viruses between the Eurasian and American clades does not occur frequently. Overall, the available evidence does not support the perpetuation of HP H5N1 influenza in migratory birds and suggests that the introduction of HP Asian H5N1 to the Americas by migratory birds is likely to be a rare event.
 Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause severe infections in humans and livestock. Control of acute listeriosis relies on innate immune responses, which are regulated by NF-κB and tissue protective factors like fibrin. However, the molecular pathways connecting NF-κB and fibrin production are not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated whether the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD, which inhibits NF-κB-dependent immune responses, also regulates protective host responses in murine listeriosis.Upon high-dose systemic infection, all Cyld−/− mice survived, while 100% of wildtype mice succumbed due to severe liver pathology and impaired pathogen control within 6 days. In vitro infection with Listeria revealed that CYLD reduced NF-κB-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, interleukin (IL)-6 secretion, and control of bacteria in macrophages. Furthermore, Western blot analyses showed that CYLD impaired STAT3-dependent fibrin production in cultivated hepatocytes. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CYLD interacted with STAT3 in the cytoplasm and strongly reduced K63-ubiquitination of STAT3 in IL-6 stimulated hepatocytes. In vivo, CYLD also reduced hepatic STAT3 K63-ubiquitination and activation, NF-κB activation, IL-6 and NOX2 mRNA production, as well as fibrin production in murine listeriosis.Neutralization experiments with anti-IL-6 antibodies, STAT3 siRNA, and warfarin (an inhibitor of fibrin production) demonstrated that IL-6-induced, STAT3-mediated fibrin production significantly contributed to protection in Cyld−/− mice. Additionally, Cyld siRNA treatment of Listeria-infected wildtype mice increased STAT3 phosphorylation, fibrin production, pathogen control, and reduced mortality, illustrating a therapeutic potential of CYLD inhibition. Overall, these findings suggest that CYLD prevents survival from severe systemic listeriosis by inhibiting protective NF-κB-dependent innate immune responses, impairing IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, and reduction of STAT3-dependent fibrin production.
 In the complex process of embryonic development, the precise and reliable organization of tissues is achieved through the interplay of extrinsic signals and intrinsic transcriptional networks. One intriguing question in developmental biology is how the genomic cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) orchestrate this process at the molecular level. In this study, researchers focused on understanding the regulation of Pax3 expression during the development of the spinal cord. Pax3 is an essential transcription factor that plays a role in the early segregation of the tissue into dorsal and ventral subdivisions.Using a combination of comparative genomics and transgenic assays, the researchers identified and dissected several functional cis-regulatory modules associated with the Pax3 locus. They found that the coordinated activity of two modules establishes and refines Pax3 expression during neural tube development. The initiating element of the first module is dependent on Wnt signaling, while the second module mediates direct positive autoregulation and feedback to maintain Pax3 expression.These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which transient external signals are converted into a sustained expression domain by the activities of distinct regulatory elements. This transcriptional logic differs from the cross-repression responsible for the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in the ventral neural tube, suggesting that a variety of circuits are deployed within the neural tube regulatory network to establish and elaborate pattern formation.
 Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and other oncoviruses can block innate immune responses and persist in the host. However, the immune response tries to clear the infection by producing IL-1β, a powerful cytokine. Our study reveals that HPV16 infection of human keratinocytes induces IL-1β secretion but blocks its transcription upon expression of the viral oncoprotein E6. E6 inhibits IRF6 transcription, which regulates IL-1β promoter activity. Preventing E6 expression or using E6 mutants that prevent p53 degradation restores IRF6 binding to the IL-1β promoter. HPV16 abrogation of p53, IRF6, and IL-1β expression was confirmed in cervical cancer cells and tissues from patients. These findings demonstrate the struggle between the host innate immune response and viral immune escape, highlighting the importance of IL-1β regulation.
 Title: A Novel Framework for Evaluating the Predictive Power of Genetic Risk Models: Beyond the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic CurveBackground: With the increasing number of genetic variants identified for complex diseases, the potential for individualized risk prediction based on genomic profiles is raising hope. However, it is still unclear whether such tests will be useful clinically. Appropriate statistical measures to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models are required.Methods: In this study, we develop a novel unifying statistical framework that connects a large variety of predictive indices together. We demonstrate how to estimate analytically a range of prediction metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement (NRI), proportion of cases explained, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile.Results: Our theoretical estimates match well with the results from simulations. We apply the methodology to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait.Discussion: The AUC, while popular, is not the only way to assess the performance of a prediction model. It has limitations, including its indirect relationship to absolute disease risks and the requirement for very large odds ratios to increase the AUC beyond existing risk factors. Our framework provides a more comprehensive way to evaluate the predictive power of genetic risk models.Conclusion: Our novel unifying statistical framework offers a more complete understanding of the predictive power of genetic risk models, providing insights beyond the area under the ROC curve. This framework can help guide the development and implementation of clinical risk prediction models based on genomic profiles.
 The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene, which is the homolog of human XPD, is essential for both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Some mutant alleles of RAD3, such as rad3-101 and rad3-102, have partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies suggested that the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3-101 and rad3-102 is due to persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. However, the systems used to characterize the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3 strains do not detect the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. In this study, the authors further characterized these events using a system in which the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination are recovered. Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events shows that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs), and the remainder reflects DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. The authors mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. They found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. Additionally, there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. The authors suggest that a subset of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
 A proposed budget cut of $26.7 million from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vector-borne diseases program could significantly impact the country's ability to handle and manage mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus. In this study, we used a mathematical model to evaluate the consequences of delayed control responses to a hypothetical dengue epidemic in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia, resulting from halted mosquito surveillance. Our findings demonstrate that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance are much lower than the costs required to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, emphasizing the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance.
 Insulator elements, such as CTCF, play a crucial role in regulating transcription by preventing inappropriate enhancer-promoter interactions. While CTCF is well-studied in vertebrates as an enhancer blocking factor, its role in Drosophila has only recently been characterized. In this study, researchers used chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites within representative regions of the Drosophila genome, including the Adh region, the Bithorax complex (BX-C), and the Antennapedia complex. They identified a CTCF binding-site consensus sequence and found that CTCF binding sites in the BX-C precisely map to known insulator elements, such as Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. Additionally, they identified new CTCF binding sites that correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains, allowing them to locate three additional presumptive insulator elements: "Fab-2," "Fab-3," and "Fab-4." With the exception of Fab-7, their data indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism. Comparison of the locations of the CTCF sites with characterized Polycomb target sites and histone modification provides support for the domain model of BX-C regulation. Overall, this study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism underpinning pathogenicity and stress responses in M. oryzae, and will also serve as a guide in studying the role of individual TF genes and the coordination of their expression in controlling development, pathogenicity, and abiotic stress responses in M. oryzae.
 Toxoplasma gondii, a parasitic protozoan, causes infection in a wide range of hosts, including humans. Previous studies have shown that strains from French Guiana exhibit genetic diversity, with distinct strain types found in anthropized and jungle environments. In this study, researchers analyzed T. gondii strains from French Guiana to better understand the composition of these distinct strain types.Comparison of intron sequences from selectively neutral genes revealed that anthropized strains were most closely related to clonal type III strains from North America, but were natural hybrids. In contrast, strains isolated from the jungle were genetically very diverse. Remarkably, nearly all anthropized strains contained the monomorphic version of Chr1a, while wild strains were extremely divergent. The presence of the monomorphic Chr1a strongly correlated with greater transmission in domestic cats, although there were several exceptions.Anthropized strains also varied in their virulence in laboratory mice, and this pattern could not be explained by the simple combination of previously identified virulence factors. This suggests that other genetic determinants influence pathogenicity. Overall, these studies underscore the marked genetic separation of anthropized and wild strains of T. gondii in French Guiana and provide additional evidence that the presence of Chr1a is associated with successful expansion of widely different lineages within diverse geographic areas. The predominance of Chr1a among strains in the anthropized environment suggests that it may confer an advantage for transmission in this environment, potentially contributing to the spread of pathogenicity determinants.
 In this study, researchers aimed to compare the intracellular spread of rabies virus and thereby viral propagation between the paralytic and furious forms of rabies. They determined the amount of rabies viral antigen beyond the neuronal cell body at different levels of the spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebrum in a cohort of naturally rabies-infected non-vaccinated dogs.Results showed that the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes decreased in a rostral direction, following the pattern for the amount of rabies viral antigen in neuronal cell bodies and the percentage of involved cell bodies. However, there was a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, suggesting that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation. Greater amounts of antigen were seen in cell processes in dogs with the furious compared to paralytic form, at all anatomic levels examined. These findings suggest that host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport may play a role in the differences between the two forms of rabies. Possible mechanisms might involve cytokine-mediated differences.Overall, this study provides important insights into the differences between the furious and paralytic forms of rabies, specifically in the intracellular spread of the virus and its impact on viral propagation. These findings may help explain the observed clinical differences between the two forms of the disease and could have implications for understanding the mechanisms of rabies virus transmission and pathogenesis.Keywords: rabies, neurotropic RNA virus, central nervous system, Lyssavirus, furious form, paralytic form, intracellular transport, cytokines, neuronal cell bodies, cell processes, viral propagation.
 Replication forks, which are essential for maintaining genome stability, can be impeded by DNA damage. To prevent potential chromosome breaks and mutations, a replication checkpoint has evolved to monitor replication fork integrity. Exo1 is a nuclease that processes stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective cells. Recent research has identified 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo1 in both yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, 14-3-3 deficient cells fail to induce Mec1-dependent Exo1 hyperphosphorylation, leading to the accumulation of Exo1-dependent ssDNA gaps at stalled forks and persistent checkpoint activation. Additionally, 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. These findings suggest that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and other unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress.
 Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes polyarthritis and rash in humans. While outbreaks of SINV have been suggested to occur every seven years in northern Europe, the reliability of this hypothesis has been questioned. To objectively assess SINV activity, researchers collected and assayed vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in Sweden for virus presence. The findings revealed that infection rates were significantly higher in 2002 compared to the previous and following years. The genetic analysis of the isolated strains suggested local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains. These results provide valuable insights into the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks and the mechanisms behind. Understanding the periodicity of SINV outbreaks can help inform public health authorities about the risk for mosquito-borne infection and motivate people to use protective measures to reduce the number of mosquito bites and thereby decrease the risk for infection and disease.
 In this study, researchers investigated the role of the deubiquitining enzyme CYLD in regulating protective host responses during severe listeriosis caused by the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. CYLD is known to inhibit the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which plays an important role in immune responses. Using wildtype and Cyld−/− mice, the researchers found that CYLD significantly reduced pathogen control and production of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-6, and NOX2 mRNA in liver and spleen, resulting in death of wildtype but not of Cyld−/− mice upon high-dose systemic infection. In vitro, CYLD impaired NF-κB-dependent pathogen control, reactive oxygen production, and IL-6 secretion in IFN-γ-stimulated, infected macrophages. The researchers also identified that CYLD directly removed K63-ubiquitin from STAT3, inhibited STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation, and reduced hepatocyte fibrin production. In Listeria-infected Cyld−/− mice, hepatic STAT3 K63-ubiquitination and activation, NF-κB activation, IL-6 production, and fibrin deposition were also increased. Neutralization experiments confirmed that the improved survival and pathogen control of Cyld−/− mice was dependent on IL-6-STAT3-mediated fibrin deposition. Finally, Cyld siRNA treatment of Listeria-infected wildtype mice significantly increased activated STAT3 and fibrin production, improved pathogen control, and reduced mortality, illustrating a therapeutic potential of CYLD inhibition. Overall, this study suggests that CYLD prevents survival from severe systemic listeriosis by inhibiting protective NF-κB-dependent innate immune responses, impairing IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, and reduction of STAT3-dependent fibrin production.
 Centromeres are essential components of chromosomes that enable their movement during cell division. While the DNA sequence of centromeres is not crucial for their function, RNA transcribed from centromeres plays a role in the epigenetic marking system that helps recruit key inner kinetochore proteins. In this study, researchers focused on CENPC, a protein that plays a crucial role in centromere recognition and maintenance. They found that CENPC has both DNA-binding and RNA-binding capacities, and that the binding domain is localized to an exon duplication region. The RNA directly facilitates the binding of CENPC to DNA in vitro, suggesting that CENPC and RNA work together to direct CENH3 to newly replicated centromere DNA.
 In this study, researchers investigated the development of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Culex pipiens pallens mosquitoes by exposing them to different selection pressures and monitoring the frequency of kdr mutations and detoxification enzyme activities. The results showed that the level of pyrethroid resistance was proportional to the insecticide selection pressure, and both kdr and metabolic resistance contributed to pyrethroid resistance in the Cx. pipiens pallens populations, but they had different roles under different selection pressures. This study provides important evidence for understanding the development and mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance, which may guide future insecticide use and vector management to avoid or delay resistance.Pyrethroids are the most commonly used insecticides for vector control, including insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying. However, the rapid spread of pyrethroid resistance worldwide compromises the effectiveness of control programs and threatens public health. Since few new insecticide classes for vector control are anticipated, limiting the development of resistance is crucial for prolonging the efficacy of pyrethroids.The researchers exposed a field-collected population of Culex pipiens pallens to different insecticide selection intensities to dynamically monitor the development of resistance. They detected kdr mutations and three detoxification enzyme activities in order to explore the evolutionary mechanism of pyrethroid resistance. The results revealed that the level of pyrethroid resistance was proportional to the insecticide selection pressure. The kdr and metabolic resistance both contributed to pyrethroid resistance in the Cx. pipiens pallens populations, but they had different roles under different selection pressures.The kdr resistance mechanism involves mutations in the sodium channel gene, reducing neuronal sensitivity to pyrethroids. The metabolic resistance, on the other hand, results from enhanced detoxification enzyme activity in resistant organisms. The primary detoxification enzymes linked to insecticide resistance include cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, carboxyl/choline esterases, and glutathione-S-transferases.Understanding the mechanism of resistance to insecticides is essential for vector control measures. The findings from this study may lead to the development of more appropriate use of insecticides and more accurate resistance monitoring systems in the field.
 Trypanosomatids, a group of unicellular protists that includes human pathogens such as Leishmania, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi, have recently had their genomes sequenced and analyzed. These studies revealed the presence of non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposons, or retroposons, which are abundant in the genomes of T. cruzi and T. brucei but absent in Leishmania major.Using the signature sequence common to all trypanosomatid retroposons as a bait, researchers identified two new families of small elements in the Leishmania major genome: LmSIDER1 (785 copies) and LmSIDER2 (1,073 copies). These elements share all the characteristics of extinct trypanosomatid retroposons and are predominantly located in the 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of L. major mRNAs.Experimental evidence suggests that LmSIDER2 acts as an mRNA instability element and that LmSIDER2-containing mRNAs are generally expressed at lower levels compared to non-LmSIDER2 mRNAs. The considerable expansion of LmSIDERs within 3'UTRs in an organism lacking transcriptional control and their role in regulating mRNA stability indicate that Leishmania have probably recycled these short retroposons to globally modulate the expression of a number of genes.This is the first example of the domestication and expansion of a family of mobile elements that have evolved to fulfill a critical cellular function in eukaryotes.
 In the world of bacteria, σ factors play a crucial role in endowing RNA polymerase with promoter specificity. Among these, Extra-Cytoplasmic Function (ECF) σ factors represent the largest and most diverse family. Most ECF σ factors require activation in response to external signals, and one mechanism of activation is through Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP). In most cases, the site-1 protease responsible for initiating the RIP process directly senses the signal. However, a recent study has uncovered a new mechanism where the anti-σ factor, RsiV, rather than the site-1 protease, acts as the sensor for the innate immune defense enzyme, lysozyme.The site-1 cleavage site for σV activation in Bacillus subtilis is similar to the recognition site of signal peptidase, and cleavage at this site is necessary for σV activation. Researchers have reconstituted site-1 cleavage in vitro and demonstrated that it requires both signal peptidase and lysozyme. They also found that the anti-σ factor RsiV directly binds to lysozyme, and muramidase activity is not required for σV activation.The proposed model suggests that the binding of lysozyme to RsiV activates RsiV for signal peptidase cleavage at site-1, initiating proteolytic destruction of RsiV and activation of σV. This finding suggests a novel mechanism in which conformational change in a substrate controls the cleavage susceptibility for signal peptidase. Unlike other ECF σ factors which require regulated intramembrane proteolysis for activation, the sensor for σV activation is not the site-1 protease but the anti-σ factor. This discovery provides new insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms governing bacterial gene expression in response to environmental signals.
 Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, has a complex surface coat primarily composed of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. However, little is known about less abundant surface proteins and their roles in host-parasite interactions. In this study, we identified a novel family of T. cruzi surface membrane proteins (TcSMP) that are conserved among different T. cruzi lineages and have orthologs in other Trypanosoma species. TcSMP genes are densely clustered within the genome, suggesting they may have originated by tandem gene duplication. TcSMP is a membrane-spanning protein located at the cellular surface and is released into the extracellular milieu. It exhibits key elements typical of surface proteins, such as an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence predicted to be a trans-membrane domain. Immunofluorescence of live parasites showed that anti-TcSMP antibodies clearly labeled the surface of all T. cruzi developmental forms. TcSMP peptides were identified in membrane vesicles as well as in soluble forms in the T. cruzi secretome. TcSMP proteins were also located intracellularly, likely associated with membrane-bound structures. TcSMP proteins were capable of inhibiting metacyclic trypomastigote entry into host cells and triggered Ca2+ signaling and lysosome exocytosis, events required for parasitophorous vacuole biogenesis. The effects of TcSMP were of lower magnitude compared to gp82, the major adhesion protein of metacyclic trypomastigotes, suggesting that TcSMP may play an auxiliary role in host cell invasion. We hypothesized that the productive interaction of T. cruzi with host cells that effectively results in internalization may depend on diverse adhesion molecules, and that the signaling induced by TcSMP may be additive to that triggered by the major surface molecule gp82, further increasing the host cell responses required for infection.
 Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neurogenic disease caused by mutations in the human survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN protein is essential for the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and its reduction leads to cell death. However, it is unclear how the reduction of this ubiquitously expressed protein can lead to tissue-specific abnormalities. Using the Drosophila system, researchers have shown that SMN is enriched in postembryonic neuroblasts and forms a concentration gradient in the differentiating progeny. In addition, Drosophila larval and adult testes have a striking SMN gradient. When SMN is reduced in postembryonic neuroblasts using MARCM clonal analysis, cell proliferation and clone formation defects occur. These SMN mutant neuroblasts fail to correctly localise Miranda and have reduced levels of snRNAs. When SMN is removed, germline stem cells are lost more frequently. Changes in SMN levels can also disrupt the correct timing of cell differentiation. These findings suggest that highly regulated SMN levels are essential to drive timely cell proliferation and cell differentiation.
 Herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry into cells requires glycoproteins gD, gH/gL, and gB, which activate in a cascade fashion through conformational modifications triggered by cognate receptors and intermolecular signaling. The receptors are nectin1 and HVEM for gD, and αvβ6 or αvβ8 integrins for gH. Previous studies have shown that inserting a single chain antibody (scFv) to the cancer receptor HER2 into gD or gH results in HSV specifically targeting HER2-positive cancer cells, creating highly specific non-attenuated oncolytic agents. In this study, researchers inserted the scFv to HER2 into gB, re-targeting the virus tropism to HER2-positive cancer cells. Surprisingly, gB, known as a fusogenic glycoprotein, was found to be the major determinant of HSV tropism. The chimeric gBHER2 bypasses the requirement for receptor-mediated activation of other essential entry glycoproteins, and a soluble form of HER2 can replace the membrane-bound HER2 in mediating virus entry, suggesting that HER2 acts by inducing conformational changes to the chimeric gB. This study demonstrates that gB can be modified and become the major determinant of HSV tropism, and the chimeric gBHER2 bypasses the requirement for receptor-mediated activation of other essential entry glycoproteins.
 Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), including Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm, affect over a billion people, particularly in developing countries. Preventive chemotherapy, which involves administering anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the primary method of control. However, this strategy does not prevent reinfection. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. From 154 studies identified, 51 were included, and 24 provided STH infection rates pre- and post-treatment. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, A. lumbricoides prevalence reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. For T. trichiura, respective reinfection prevalence were 36%, 67%, and 82%, and for hookworm, 30%, 55%, and 57%. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. To maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy, frequent anthelmintic drug administrations are needed, along with integrated control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation to interrupt transmission.
 Rabies is a deadly disease that can be prevented through prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes vaccination and, in some cases, the administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). However, access to PEP is a challenge, particularly in resource-poor countries where it is often not readily available or affordable. In this study, researchers analyzed different PEP vaccination regimens and their costs and benefits. They found that PEP vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention, with costs ranging from $200 to less than $60 per life saved. Switching from intramuscular (IM) administration of PEP to equally effective intradermal (ID) regimens can result in significant savings in vaccine volume, which could help mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce costs. The researchers also presented financing mechanisms to make PEP more affordable and accessible, including subsidies for those in need and support for rabies control and prevention programs. They concluded that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths and being economical for healthcare providers.
 In this study, researchers investigated the relationship between human cases of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. b. rhodesiense) infection and the presence of T. brucei s. l. infections in cattle in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts in Uganda. T. b. rhodesiense is the causative agent of the acute form of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), while T. brucei s. l. includes both human-infective and non-human infective strains.The study found that villages with reported cases of HAT had higher odds of T. brucei s. l. infections in cattle compared to villages without reported cases. Cattle age was also found to be a significant factor, with older cattle (18-36 months and over 36 months) having higher odds of T. brucei s. l. infection than younger cattle. Additionally, the study found that the likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense being detected in a village herd was higher in villages with reported cases of HAT. A higher than average T. brucei s. l. prevalence in a village herd was also associated with a higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense being detected.These findings suggest that infected cattle play a significant role in the transmission of T. b. rhodesiense to humans, and that older cattle are more likely to carry both human-infective and non-human infective strains of T. brucei s. l. The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between infected cattle and human cases of HAT in order to effectively respond to the risk posed to communities from animals infected with human pathogens.
 Dietary restriction (DR) is a well-known intervention that extends lifespan and delays age-related diseases in various species. The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is known to be essential for the longevity phenotypes resulting from DR in flies and yeast. TOR is a conserved protein kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth factors. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has been identified as a new target of the TOR pathway, which plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response. In this study, we describe a novel role for HIF-1 in modulating lifespan extension by DR in C. elegans. We find that HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with that by inhibition of the RSKS-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the TOR pathway. Our results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway.
 Acetogens, a type of microorganism that can ferment a wide range of substrates, are of great interest for the biotechnological production of commodity chemicals due to their ability to grow with hydrogen and carbon dioxide or syngas (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide). However, advanced design strategies for acetogens are currently limited by incomplete knowledge about their physiology and our inability to accurately predict their phenotypes. In this study, researchers reconstructed a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) for the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. This ME-model is the first of its kind for a Gram-positive bacterium and captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways to synthesize RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology by explicitly predicting both RNA and protein abundances, enabling the exploration of cofactor requirements and providing new inroads for advanced engineering designs. The researchers used the model to reveal how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens and accurately predicted secretion of multiple fermentation products. Predicting overflow metabolism is of particular interest since it enables new design strategies, such as the formation of glycerol, a novel product for C. ljungdahlii, and broadens the metabolic capability for this model microbe. Additionally, the prediction and experimental validation of changing secretion rates based on different metal availability opens the window into fermentation optimization and provides new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.
 In the present study, researchers investigated the link between toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and FcγRIII in vitro and in vivo. TLR4 is essential for responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is involved in FcγRIII signaling via FcRγ-subunit activation. The findings suggest that TLR4 and FcγRIII pathways are structurally and functionally connected.TLR4 is a pattern-recognition receptor that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to bacterial infections. It recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and initiates the intracellular signaling pathway, ultimately leading to NF-κB activation and subsequent cytokine/chemokine production and release. FcγRs, on the other hand, are predominantly expressed on immune and inflammatory cells and bind to the Fc domain of immunoglobulins. Binding of IgGs to FcγRs on phagocytes triggers a wide variety of cellular functions, including phagocytosis, release of inflammatory mediators, and clearance of immune complexes.The study found that TLR4 is involved in FcγRIII signaling and that heterodimerization of TLR4 and FcγRIII occurs in the presence of IgGIC but not LPS. Consequently, dysfunctional TLR4 signaling results in unresponsiveness of immune cells in vitro to both LPS and IgGIC, leading to the absence of acute lung injury after intratracheal administration of LPS or intrapulmonary immune complex deposition.In summary, the study provides new insights into the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, which closely interact with each other at the receptor level and post receptor signaling pathways. The findings have important implications for understanding the complex regulation of immune responses and the role of TLR4 and FcγRIII in the immune response to bacterial infections.
 Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), cause foodborne disease and pose a significant economic and health burden. EHEC, which can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), utilizes a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells. In this study, researchers identified two T3SS effectors, NleH1 and NleH2, that bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of NF-κB transcriptional complexes. The binding of NleH1 and NleH2 to RPS3 occurs in the cytoplasm but not in cell nuclei, and their binding is independent of kinase activity. NleH1 inhibits RPS3-dependent transcription, while NleH2 stimulates it. The findings suggest that NleH may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes. Deleting nleH1 from EHEC produced a hypervirulent phenotype in a gnotobiotic piglet model of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection. Overall, the study provides insights into how bacterial effectors bind to host proteins and disrupt normal functions of intestinal epithelial cells.Keywords: microbiology, cellular microbiology and pathogenesis, innate immunity, Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, type III secretion system, T3SS, ribosomal protein S3, NF-κB, transcriptional complexes, host-pathogen interactions.
 Cryptococcus neoformans is a common and life-threatening human fungal pathogen, typically measuring 5 to 10 micrometers in size. However, in vivo observations have revealed the presence of enlarged cells, up to 100 micrometers, which affect pathogenicity by reducing phagocytosis, increasing resistance to oxidative and nitrosative stress, and correlated with reduced penetration of the central nervous system. This cell enlargement is stimulated by coinfection with strains of opposite mating types and ste3aΔ pheromone receptor mutant strains, which have reduced cell enlargement. The DNA content analysis of these novel cells revealed they are polyploid, uninucleate, and produce daughter cells in vivo. This study describes a novel mechanism by which C. neoformans evades host phagocytosis, allowing survival of a subset of the population during early stages of infection. Morphological changes play unique and specialized roles during infection.
 During an epidemic, individuals can reduce their risk of infection by practicing social distancing, which involves reducing contact rates with infectious individuals. However, the value of social distancing depends on the severity of the epidemic and the costs associated with the behavior. In this study, a differential game was used to identify the optimal use of social distancing and related self-protective behaviors during an epidemic. The epidemic was modeled using a simple, well-mixed ordinary differential equation, and the game was used to calculate the equilibrium behaviors under various cost functions. The results showed that social distancing is most beneficial for individuals when the basic reproduction number is around 2. In the absence of vaccines or other intervention measures, optimal social distancing never recovers more than 30% of the cost of infection. The window of opportunity for vaccine development also lengthens as the efficiency of social distancing and detection improve.Introduction:Epidemics of infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to human health, as demonstrated by the 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza. One of the key questions in public health epidemiology is how individual and community actions can help mitigate and manage the costs of an epidemic. Social distancing, which involves reducing contact rates between susceptible individuals and infectious individuals, is an important behavior that can help reduce the severity of an epidemic. However, the value of social distancing depends on the efficiency of the response and how it changes the epidemic as a whole.Theoretical work on social distancing has been stimulated by studies of agent-based influenza simulations, which suggest that small changes in behavior can have large effects on transmission patterns during an epidemic. Compartmental epidemic models have also been used to study social distancing by including states that represent individuals employing specific behaviors. For instance, Hyman and Li formulated and began the analysis of flu disease transmission in SIR models where some individuals decrease their activity levels following infection. Reluga and Medlock used this approach to show that social distancing can resemble immunization but can generate hysteresis phenomena much more readily than immunization.Rather than treating behaviors as states, some models treat behaviors as parameters determined by simple functions of the available information. Reluga et al. studied dynamics where contact rates can depend on the perceived disease incidence. Buonomo et al. investigated the impact of information dynamics on the stability of stationary solutions in epidemic models. Chen considered a similar system but allowed individuals to learn from a random sample of neighbors. Funk et al. considered the information dynamics associated with social distancing in a network setting by prescribing a reduction in contacts based on proximity to infection.Building on the ground-breaking work of Fine and Clarkson, there has been substantial recent interest in the application of game theory to epidemiology. The games studied so far have primarily considered steady-state problems and have not allowed for dynamic strategies. One notable exception is the work of Francis, which determines the time-dependent game-theoretical solution of a vaccination problem over the course of an epidemic. Van Boven et al. studied the optimal use of anti-viral treatment by individuals when they take into account the direct and indirect costs of treatment.To study the best usage of social distancing, we apply differential-game theory at a population-scale. Differential games are games where strategies have a continuous time-dependence; at each point in time, a player can choose a different action. For instance, a pursuit-game between a target and a pursuer is a two-player differential game where each player's strategies consist of choosing how to move at each successive time until the target is caught by the pursuer or escapes. Geometrically, one might think of differential games as games where strategies are represented by curves instead of points. Two-player differential-game theory was systematically developed by Isaacs as an extension of optimal control theory.Here, we employ an extension of differential game theory to population games of the form described by Reluga and Galvani. The analysis in this paper will be limited to the simplest case of the Kermack-McKendrick SIR model with strong mixing. In the Model section, we formulate an epidemiological-economics model for an epidemic, accounting for the individual and community costs of both social distancing practices and infection. We then use differential game theory and numerical methods to identify the equilibrium strategies over the course of an epidemic. Numerical methods are used to investigate the finite-time problem where vaccines become available after a fixed interval from the start of the epidemic and the infinite-horizon problem without vaccination. Fundamental results on the value and timing of social distancing are obtained.
 Dengue is a significant public health issue, with an estimated 50-100 million cases per year and 3 billion people at risk. Dengue is caused by the dengue virus, which is primarily transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The disease can range from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe forms like dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Early and accurate diagnosis of dengue is crucial for clinical management, but current methods like virus isolation and real-time RT-PCR have limitations. Serological tests, such as the Dengue Duo Cassette, which detects IgM and IgG antibodies, are commonly used but have limitations in detecting early infections.A new commercial dengue NS1 antigen detection test, the Dengue Early Rapid, has been developed to improve diagnostic sensitivity, especially in detecting early infections. The test was evaluated in retrospective studies in Vietnam and Malaysia, and the results showed a sensitivity of 69.2% (Vietnam) and 68.9% (Malaysia) when used alone, and a specificity of 96% in both studies. When used in combination with the IgM/IgG test, the sensitivity increased to 93.0%. The test differentiates antigen and antibody markers, and can extend the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples. Using dengue NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology can significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and enhance the clinical utility of rapid immunochromatographic testing for dengue.
 Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial for initiating and propagating the innate immune response in eukaryotic cells. In this study, researchers investigated TirS, a Staphylococcus aureus TIR mimic that is part of a novel bacterial invasion mechanism. They found that ectopic expression of TirS in eukaryotic cells inhibited TLR signaling, downregulating the NF-κB pathway and reducing TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 activity. In a mouse model, skin lesions caused by the S. aureus knockout tirS mutant were more severe compared to wild-type, and the strain restored antibiotic resistance even though the tirS-mutant and wild-type strains did not differ in bacterial load. TirS was also associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity, confirming its role in virulence attenuation through local inflammatory responses. TirS was found in the staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance but not always carrying the mecA gene. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid increased tirS expression, and epidemiological studies showed a selective advantage with a SCCmec element carrying SCC fusC/tirS. These findings suggest that the ability of S. aureus to survive and establish a critical population size may be linked to the presence of TirS.
 Protein N-terminal acetylation is a common modification found in various organisms, including insects and humans. This modification occurs co-translationally, after the removal of the initiator methionine residue. While the enzymes involved in this process have been studied, the biological function of N-terminal acetylation is not well understood. In this study, researchers analyzed the amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and identified more than 1,200 mature protein N-termini. They found that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans and extracted the X PX rule, which indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer a protein to study the functional importance of the presence or absence of an acetyl group, providing a generic assay to probe the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylation. The researchers applied this assay by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and in flies, paving the way for a systematic study of the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylation in cells and whole organisms. Since the X PX rule seems to be of general validity in lower and higher eukaryotes, it can be used to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species.
 Exosomes, small membrane-encapsulated vesicles, play a crucial role in viral infections by transferring genetic materials between cells. In the case of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), exosomes released from infected cells contain viral RNA and miR-146a, which can facilitate the viral replication in a new target cell by suppressing type I interferon response. This study reveals that EV71 infection leads to upregulated exosome secretion and differential packaging of viral RNA and miR-146a into exosomes. The exosomal viral RNA can replicate in a recipient cell, while the exosomal miR-146a suppresses type I interferon response, enabling the viral replication. Additionally, IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs) and BST-2/tetherin were found to regulate EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. In vivo studies showed that exosomal viral RNA exhibits differential tissue accumulation compared to free virus particles. Overall, this research provides evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which facilitates the exosomal EV71 RNA to replicate in the recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.
 Recent experiments have shown that the interaction between chromatin loops plays an important role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. However, there is a need for a modeling effect that systematically addresses how changes in connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form affect variability at the expression level. In this study, we present a mechanistic model that maps three fundamental patterns for two interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of stochastic transcription. Our results show that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, while alternating loops have opposite effects. We also compare the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression and find that the former performs better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise, but this control or tuning is distance-dependent and there is a limit loop length such that the difference in effect between two communication forms almost disappears. Our analysis and results justify the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis.
 Predicting the behavior of large gene transcription networks is a significant challenge in systems and synthetic biology due to the context-dependent behavior of modules. One cause of context-dependence is retroactivity, a phenomenon similar to loading that influences the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules in non-trivial ways. In this study, we establish an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity.We define a module's key properties using three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity. All of them have a physical interpretation and can be computed from macroscopic parameters (dissociation constants and promoter concentrations) and the modules' topology. The internal retroactivity quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on an isolated module's dynamics. The scaling and mixing retroactivity establish how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules.Using these matrices and the dynamics of modules in isolation, we can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. We illustrate the implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. We also provide a quantitative metric that determines how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules, which can be employed to evaluate the modularity of natural networks and establish design guidelines to minimize retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.
 Lung cancer, specifically non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women. For patients with resectable NSCLC, the choice of preoperative chemotherapy is crucial for eliminating micrometastases and improving operability. In silico experiments can suggest the optimal treatment protocol based on the cytotoxic efficacy of drugs on cancer cells. In this study, a mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment was used to estimate the plausible value range of the cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens. The model takes into account cancer mechanisms such as uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. The methodology is based on tumor volumetric data at two time points and considers the effect of tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify key features for more accurate estimates, including the volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis. The methodology was applied to the retrospective data of thirteen patients with NSCLC who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The results provide a quantitative framework for estimating the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies, which could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
 Psychomotor retardation, a condition characterized by motor and cognitive impairments, is a complex neurological disorder with unclear mechanisms and limited treatment options. The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is an X-linked form of psychomotor retardation associated with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, which is responsible for thyroid hormone (TH) transport. To better understand the pathophysiology of AHDS, researchers generated an MCT8 knockout zebrafish using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) gene editing. The elimination of MCT8 led to decreased TH receptor expression and neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light, increased sleep time, and impaired myelin formation and axon branching in sensory and motor neurons. TH analogs restored some of these deficiencies, suggesting a mechanism by which MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly and mediates sensory and motor control. These findings provide insights into the therapeutic potential of TH analogs for AHDS patients.
 In the world of biology, natural selection drives populations towards higher fitness, but crossing fitness valleys or plateaus can facilitate progress up a rugged fitness landscape. A new study investigates quantitatively the effect of subdividing an asexual population on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau. The researchers focus on a minimal model that includes only population subdivision into equivalent demes connected by global migration, without significant size changes or environmental heterogeneity. They determine the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision, if the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest. The study shows that isolated demes must be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. The researchers obtain analytical expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved and verify their predictions through stochastic simulations. The results demonstrate that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus over a wide range of parameters, extending beyond the optimal window. The study also investigates the effect of varying the degree of subdivision and the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. The findings have implications for understanding the role of population structure in evolution and inferring fitness landscape structure from evolution experiments.
 The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a crucial structure in the nuclear envelope that regulates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The mechanism of this transport process, which happens on the order of milliseconds and involves hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and FG repeat domains, remains elusive. To better understand this process, researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure that mimics nucleocytoplasmic transport. This model predicts that the first-passage time of a cargo-complex is about 2.6 ms and that the kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. The model also suggests that cytoplasmic filaments play a defining role in the selectivity barrier of the NPC. Overall, this study provides new insights into the biophysical mechanisms of nucleocytoplasmic transport and the role of the NPC in regulating molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope.
 Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium that can cause a range of infections, from minor skin conditions to life-threatening systemic infections. Persistent infections often involve biofilms, which are communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are resistant to antibiotics and the immune system. In this study, researchers discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. These fibers are made up of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) and have amyloid-like properties. Mutants unable to produce PSMs were more susceptible to biofilm disassembly, suggesting that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms. This discovery could lead to new approaches in treating persistent biofilm-associated infections.
 In the field of neuroscience, it is widely accepted that cognitive and behavioral processes are ultimately implemented through nonlinear neural system dynamics. However, directly assessing these underlying dynamics from experimental measurements is a significant challenge. Traditional approaches, such as linear state space models, have limitations in capturing complex dynamical phenomena like multi-stability, complex limit cycles, or chaos. To address this, researchers have turned to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a more powerful alternative.RNNs are a class of nonlinear dynamic models that can approximate any other dynamical system. By embedding RNNs into a statistical inference framework, researchers have developed a nonlinear state space model using piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) for the latent dynamical process. This approach allows for the inference of system parameters by maximizing a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the observations.In this study, the authors present a state space model based on generative piecewise-linear recurrent neural networks (PLRNNs) to assess dynamics from neuroimaging data. They introduce a new observation model suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, an efficient stepwise training procedure, and an empirical measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to evaluate how well the learnt dynamics capture the underlying dynamics.The authors validate their approach on simulated ground-truth dynamical systems and demonstrate that the learnt dynamics harbor task-related nonlinear structure that a linear dynamical model fails to capture. Given that fMRI is a common technique for measuring brain activity non-invasively in human subjects, this approach may provide a novel step toward analyzing aberrant (nonlinear) dynamics for clinical assessment or neuroscientific research.
 Burkholderia pseudomallei, a mostly saprophytic bacterium, can cause the serious disease melioidosis in humans. Despite proper diagnosis and treatment, mortality rates for melioidosis remain high. It was previously assumed that B. pseudomallei uses common iron-acquisition systems, such as siderophores, to survive within its hosts. However, recent discoveries suggest that other iron-acquisition systems may contribute to virulence.In this study, researchers deleted the major siderophore malleobactin and pyochelin gene clusters in strain 1710b and found a residual siderophore activity unrelated to other known Burkholderia siderophores. They also discovered that Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, and that Hem cannot complement a Hmu deficiency. Prolonged incubation of a hmu hem mutant in hemoglobin-containing minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin, suggesting alternate pathways for utilization of these two host iron sources. Lactoferrin utilization was dependent on malleobactin but not pyochelin synthesis and/or uptake. A mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. These data suggest that B. pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth.Introduction:Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that normally survives as a saprophyte in soil and water but is also capable of infecting most mammals and causing serious infections, including melioidosis. Despite rapid diagnosis and prompt and aggressive treatment, the fatality rate for melioidosis patients still ranges from 10-20% in Australia to over 40% in Thailand. B. pseudomallei is considered an emerging pathogen and infections have been increasingly reported in many countries in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Iron is essential for bacteria, yet in almost any abiotic or biotic environment, bacteria are confronted with levels of soluble iron too low to sustain growth. The two main strategies used by Gram-negative bacteria to acquire biotic iron are uptake of iron-siderophore complexes and uptake of heme. Because of the necessity for iron uptake, siderophore-dependent uptake mechanisms are considered virulence factors, and corresponding mutants are severely attenuated in animal models of infection. In Burkholderia species, iron acquisition mechanisms have been best characterized in members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). These bacteria produce as many as four different siderophores (ornibactin, pyochelin, cepabactin, and cepaciachelin). In addition, Bcc bacteria possess mechanisms for acquiring iron from heme and ferritin. Very little is known about iron acquisition mechanisms in B. pseudomallei. The bacterium produces a hydroxamate-type siderophore, malleobactin, that can remove iron from lactoferrin and transferrin, allowing this bacterium to grow under iron-limiting conditions. Genome-wide microarray expression and whole genome sequence analyses identified genes encoding a number of other iron acquisition systems, such as a pyochelin (pch) gene cluster, a heme uptake locus (hmu), and plasma membrane iron transporters. Despite the recognized importance of iron acquisition systems, no data have been published about the contribution of any of these to B. pseudomallei virulence. There is evidence that iron availability influences colony morphology, a not well-understood characteristic of B. pseudomallei that affects virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility. We previously discovered that the clinical isolate 708a contains a large (>130 kb) genomic deletion. This deleted region includes the amrAB-oprA efflux pump operon, which explains the gentamicin sensitivity of 708a. The >90 gene region also contains numerous other genes that may be pertinent for B. pseudomallei's physiology and pathogenesis. Of note is the absence of the complete malleobactin biosynthetic gene cluster. Despite the lack of this gene cluster and, presumably, malleobactin, 708a caused human melioidosis and was fully le
 Schistosomiasis, caused by the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, can lead to in-utero sensitization in the offspring of infected women. This sensitization may influence their immune responsiveness and morbidity when they are exposed to the parasite later in life. A study was conducted in Uganda to examine the effects of praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni during pregnancy on the prevalence and immune responsiveness of offspring at age five years. The study involved 1343 children, and no difference in infection prevalence was observed between children of treated and untreated mothers. However, children with S. mansoni infection had higher cytokine and antibody responses to SWA and SEA, as well as higher FoxP3 expression. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had no effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to SWA, which were higher in offspring of women who received praziquantel during pregnancy. These findings suggest that maternal S. mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This may have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.
 Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV), are large DNA viruses that encode a complex network of proteins to manipulate host cells for efficient propagation. While many viral proteins have known functions, over 60% of CMV-encoded proteins have no functional annotation. Understanding the roles of these uncharacterized proteins is important for determining how viruses propagate and for identifying mechanisms that regulate key cellular processes.To gain insights into the functions of these proteins, researchers generated a mammalian expression library consisting of most of the open reading frames of HSV, CMV, and EBV. They expressed these proteins fused to a C-terminal tag suitable for protein localization and protein interaction studies. The team then conducted subcellular localization screening for all of these proteins.The study identified several proteins from all three viruses that disrupt PML bodies, suggesting that they would enable viral infection. These findings provide the first information on the potential function of 120 previously unstudied viral proteins and show that each virus has multiple mechanisms to disrupt PML bodies that were not previously recognized.PML bodies are involved in several important host cell processes, including apoptosis and the DNA damage response, and suppress lytic infection of both RNA and DNA viruses as part of an intrinsic immune response. By disrupting PML bodies, some viral proteins counteract this antiviral response and enable viral infection.The study's findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the functions of uncharacterized viral proteins and the role they play in viral infection and host cell manipulation. Further research in this area could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating viral infections.Keywords: virology/persistence and latency, virology/virulence factors and mechanisms, virology/viral replication and gene regulation, cell biology/nuclear structure and function, virology/viruses and cancer, virology/host antiviral responses.
 Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are large DNA viruses that encode a complex network of proteins to manipulate host cells for efficient propagation. While many proteins have known functions, over 60% of CMV-encoded proteins have no functional annotation. Understanding the role of each viral protein is crucial for determining how viruses propagate and identifying mechanisms that regulate key cellular processes.To gain insights into the functions of previously unstudied proteins, researchers determined the subcellular localization of 234 epitope-tagged proteins from HSV, CMV, and EBV using a mammalian expression library. They identified 24 proteins that formed subnuclear structures, 12 of which localized to the nucleolus and 5 to PML bodies, which suppress viral lytic infection. Additionally, two proteins disrupted Cajal bodies, and 19 of the nuclear proteins significantly decreased the number of PML bodies per cell, including six that were shown to be SUMO-modified.These findings provide the first functional insights into over 120 previously unstudied proteins and suggest that herpesviruses employ multiple strategies for manipulating nuclear bodies that control key cellular processes. Understanding these strategies can lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between viruses and their host cells.
 Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a crucial mechanism by which bacteria increase genetic diversity and adapt to new environments. However, the incorporation of foreign DNA may pose a challenge for the regulation of the bacterial core genome, leading to a potential fitness cost. The global modulator H-NS plays a role in controlling the expression of both core and HGT genes in response to external stimuli. In enteric bacteria, plasmid-encoded H-NS proteins have evolved to selectively silence HGT genes without interfering with core genome regulation. This selective silencing requires the presence of helper proteins, such as Hha, which form H-NS-Hha complexes to tightly silence HGT DNA. Core genes, on the other hand, are modulated by H-NS homoligomers. The capacity to discriminate between core and HGT DNA may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in silent form and give these bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments. The H-NS system in enteric bacteria presents unique evolutionary features, as the presence of Hha-like proteins and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants is restricted to this family.
 Recent studies on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have revealed that it has a dedicated mechanism for forgetting, which is not a result of capacity or retrieval limitations but rather an adaptive strategy to optimally cope with a changing environment. This active form of forgetting, which is modulated by the learning task and not by internal constraints of the memory system, allows the fruit fly to show forgetting with a rate that is linked to the time scale of changes in the environment. Moreover, an optimal agent may trade the risk of immediate pain for information gain and thus forget faster after aversive conditioning to reduce the odds of missing future reward. A simple neuronal network reproduces these features, and the theory shows that forgetting in Drosophila appears as an optimal adaptive behavior in a changing environment. This view is in line with the idea that forgetting is adaptive rather than a consequence of limitations of the memory system.
 In recent years, linear mixed models (LMMs) have gained popularity for modeling population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the variety of LMM methods and software packages can make it unclear how they differ from each other. In this study, we compared the performance of several LMM approaches, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM, through their application to a GWAS of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families. We investigated the sensitivity of these methods to user-chosen options and their success in controlling the overall genome-wide error rate. We also compared the LMM results to traditional family-based association tests and alternative approaches. We found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches and all were successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches when applied naively to longitudinal data with many repeated measures. The LMM approaches also showed high correlation with alternative approaches, except for transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. Overall, we concluded that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches. The choice of precise LMM implementation cannot be based on power or type I error considerations but must instead be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use.
 A team of researchers has developed a novel screening approach to identify genes that maintain cellular ATP levels in human cells. They used a fluorescent biosensor and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to measure ATP in single living cells and identified genes that are most essential to maintaining energy levels. They found that mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are particularly critical in maintaining energy levels and enabling cell growth. They also identified genetic targets that could be amenable to an energy-based therapy via supplementation with the mitochondrial cofactor coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). These findings provide valuable insight into key pathways and therapeutic strategies to maintain ATP in human cells. The screening paradigm can also be used to identify genetic defects that will be responsive to energy-based therapies and may enable powerful screens for other key metabolites to further advance a genome-scale understanding of the regulation of metabolism.
 In the complex world of cellular signaling, two-component systems play a crucial role in enabling bacteria to adapt to environmental changes, a key feature for bacterial survival. One such system, the general stress response (GSR) in the plant-protecting alphaproteobacterium Sphingomonas melonis Fr1, involves a two-component system consisting of multiple stress-sensing histidine kinases (Paks) and the response regulator PhyR. PhyR, in turn, regulates the alternative sigma factor EcfG, which controls expression of the GSR regulon.Although it was known that Paks phosphorylate PhyR in vitro, it was unclear if and under what conditions this direct phosphorylation occurs in the cell. This is because Paks also phosphorylate the single domain response regulator SdrG, an essential yet enigmatic component of the GSR signaling pathway.In a recent study, researchers investigated the role of SdrG and the alternative function of the membrane-bound PhyP (renamed PhyT), previously assumed to act as a PhyR phosphatase. They found that PhyT transfers a phosphoryl group from SdrG to PhyR via phosphoryl transfer on a conserved His residue. This finding, along with complementary GSR reporter assays, indicates the participation of SdrG and PhyT in a Pak-SdrG-PhyT-PhyR phosphorelay.Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated complex formation between PhyT and PhyR. This finding is substantiated by PhyT-dependent membrane association of PhyR in unstressed cells, while the response regulator is released from the membrane upon stress induction. Their data support a model in which PhyT sequesters PhyR, thereby favoring Pak-dependent phosphorylation of SdrG. In addition, PhyT assumes the role of the SdrG-phosphotransferase to activate PhyR.These results place SdrG into the GSR signaling cascade and uncover a dual role of PhyT in the GSR. By understanding the intricacies of this signaling system, researchers can gain insights into how bacteria respond to stress and adapt to their environment.
 Miltefosine, a drug originally developed for cancer treatment, has shown promising effects against Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis. In this study, researchers investigated how miltefosine affects the exposure of worm surface antigens in vitro. They found that miltefosine treatment led to strong immunofluorescence of adult worms using both rabbit anti-S. mansoni adult worm homogenate and anti-S. mansoni infection antiserum. Four proteins were identified through western immunoblotting and mass spectrometry that reacted with the antibodies, which were found to bind to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induce immune agglutination. These findings suggest a novel mode of action for miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent and potentially as intervention targets and antibodies against these antigens may act to increase the drug's anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection.Introduction:Schistosomiasis, caused by the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, remains a significant public health concern despite control efforts. The current drug, praziquantel (PZQ), is the only available treatment, but concerns over its efficacy and the emergence of resistance have led researchers to explore alternative therapeutic strategies. One approach is drug repositioning, which involves identifying and developing new uses for existing, approved drugs. Miltefosine, a drug approved for topical treatment of cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer, has shown promising effects against Schistosoma spp. in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism by which miltefosine exerts its effect is unclear, and it is believed to act mainly on cell membranes, producing biophysical perturbation of lipid rafts and interfering with phospholipid metabolism and cell growth signalling pathways. One target of miltefosine is sphingomyelin, a schistosome membrane phospholipid. However, it is not known if miltefosine induces exposure of antigens on the parasite surface. In the present study, researchers evaluated the in vitro effect of miltefosine on a Puerto Rican strain of S. mansoni and investigated whether the drug treatment would unmask hidden antigens on the adult worm tegument using immunofluorescence (IF) and western immunoblotting assays linked to a proteomic approach, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). They also investigated the likelihood of expression of the proteins exposed by the drug on the surface of adults and 3-hour schistosomula. Previous studies have shown that exposure of cryptic adult membrane proteins can be an important factor in host immune responses and potentially involved in development of resistance to re-infection by targeting migratory schistosomula.Keywords:schistosoma, invertebrates, medicine and health sciences, immune physiology, body fluids, helminths, immunology, parasitic diseases, animals, parasitology, developmental biology, pharmaceutics, antibodies, immunologic techniques, research and analysis methods, immune system proteins, proteins, immunoassays, life cycles, immunofluorescence, biochemistry, blood, anatomy, physiology, biology and life sciences, drug therapy, immune serum, organisms, parasitic life cycles.Lay Summary:Miltefosine, a drug originally developed for cancer treatment, has shown promising effects against Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis.

 Neurons have distinct molecular compositions and functional properties in their axons and dendrites, which is crucial for shaping neuronal form and function. However, the molecular processes that mediate polarized targeting of neuronal proteins are not well understood. Recent studies have shown that Myosin Va plays a critical role in targeting transmembrane proteins to dendrites, but the role of myosin motors in axonal targeting is unknown. In this study, we found that Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. Engineering non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myosin VI causes them to become highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Disruption of Myosin VI function or expression leads to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myosin VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that has been shown to underlie the localization of many axonal proteins. Additionally, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon in mice in vivo, suggesting it could be a useful tool for probing circuit structure and function. Overall, our results indicate that myosins help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins.
 In the field of ecology, the consensus that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems has been a long-standing assumption. However, recent studies have challenged this notion, suggesting that large and complex ecosystems may not necessarily be more stable. A new analysis provides analytical results and simulations that show equilibrium feasibility, a key assumption for local stability criteria, vanishes in species-rich systems. This result leaves the assumption that complexity begets stability in an uncomfortable position, as the existence of a feasible equilibrium is not guaranteed. The study also explores the impact of changing interaction structure and intensity and finds that feasibility and stability are warranted in systems with weak interactions, regardless of species richness. The findings suggest that a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.
 Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a DNA virus linked to several types of cancer. The virus synthesizes structural proteins, which form the protein shell around the viral genome, after amplification of the viral genome. The mechanism controlling expression of these late genes has long been a mystery in EBV and other DNA viruses. In this study, researchers have discovered that two EBV regulatory proteins, BGLF4 and BGLF3, control synthesis of mRNAs encoding viral structural proteins. BGLF4 is a protein kinase conserved in all herpesviruses, while BGLF3 is a protein of unknown function with no cellular counterparts. The enzymatic activity of BGLF4 is required after replication of viral DNA to stimulate expression of structural proteins. BGLF3 and BGLF4 are expressed from the same locus in the genome and work in concert and independently to promote expression of viral genes encoding structural proteins. These findings provide novel insights into control of expression of genes encoding viral structural proteins and potential targets for development of new antiviral drugs.
 Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is commonly found in soil and water in tropical regions. Diabetes mellitus is the most significant risk factor for melioidosis, and prevention recommendations include avoiding direct contact with soil and water and drinking only boiled or bottled water. A multifaceted prevention program for melioidosis was evaluated in diabetic adults in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. The program included ten behavioral support groups, each with six to ten participants, and used twelve behavior change techniques, such as information about health consequences, commitment, and social support. Participants found the intervention beneficial, interesting, and engaging. The proportion of participants who always wore boots while working in rice fields increased from 30% to 77%, and the proportion who drank only boiled or bottled water increased from 43% to 86%. The program is highly acceptable to participants and can support behavior change. Policy makers should consider implementing the program in areas where melioidosis is endemic. Making calendars with individual photographs and self-pledges as a reminder tool could be a powerful component in behavior change interventions, and further research is needed on this component.
 Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease can lead to chronic stages with no cure currently available. In this study, researchers optimized a whole cell-based assay for high-throughput screening of compounds that inhibit T. cruzi infection in mammalian cells. A 2000-compound chemical library was screened using a recombinant T. cruzi strain expressing β-galactosidase. Three hits were identified with high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells: PCH1, NT1, and CX1. Each of these compounds has a different mechanism of action against intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes. CX1 shows strong trypanocidal activity, which is essential for the development of drugs against the chronic stage of Chagas disease. NT1 has a trypanostatic effect, while PCH1 affects parasite division. The three compounds also show high activity against intracellular T. cruzi from the Y strain and against related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. Two additional compounds, PCH6 and CX2, were selected based on their chemical similarity to the library hits and their low IC50 values of 2 nM, which are approximately 100 times lower than the medicines used to treat T. cruzi. These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
 Bistability, the ability of a system to exist in two stable states, is a common feature of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control essential biological functions such as cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. However, identifying the network topologies that can exhibit bistability is a challenge due to the vast number of possible GRNs. In this study, researchers used chemical reaction network theory to systematically survey over 40,000 simple GRNs formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins, and found that approximately 90% of these networks have the capacity for bistability. The findings reveal eleven minimal bistable networks, which are bistable networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks. The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies suggests that switch-like behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not easily lost through network evolution. The researchers also applied this systematic approach to publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion. This study demonstrates the relevance of parameter-free CRNT analysis in identifying bistable networks in real biological systems.
 Filarial infections, caused by parasitic worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, can lead to lymphatic dysfunction and obstruction, resulting in conditions like lymphedema and elephantiasis. While the adaptive immune response is thought to play a role in the severe, irreversible forms of these conditions in humans, recent studies suggest that filarial parasites and their antigens may also directly influence the lymphatics. In this study, human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected patient serum. The results showed that live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Additionally, serum from infected patients induced increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. The differentiation of LEC into tube-like networks was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (TIMPs). Comparison of global gene expression in LEC exposed to live parasites versus parasite-unexposed LEC revealed that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways, which in turn decreased trans-endothelial transport. These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis.
 In this study, researchers introduce a new method for estimating local ancestry (LA) in admixed populations using short read pileup data and the time of admixture within a population. The method models ancestry across the genome as a hidden Markov model (HMM) and estimates LA by explicitly modeling read counts as a function of sample allele frequencies within an admixed population. This approach is generalized to accommodate arbitrary sample ploidies and yields accurate LA estimates for simulated datasets, including samples of high sample ploidy and evolutionary scenarios that violate the assumptions of the neutral demographic model. The researchers demonstrate that their method offers a significant improvement over existing LAI methods and provides a solution to the problem of assumptions about the time since admixture impacting the results of these methods. They apply their method to a Drosophila melanogaster ancestry cline on the east coast of North America and find evidence of natural selection operating against the introduction of foreign ancestry into populations of one predominant ancestry type. The results provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics and genome organization.
 The study explores the role of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in protein complexes and their impact on cellular signaling. The researchers integrated datasets of global acetylation, ubiquitination, and tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation with protein interaction data. They identified hundreds of protein complexes that selectively accumulate each PTM, indicating coordinated targeting of specific molecular functions. Furthermore, they found that PTM integration (PTMi) spots, which represent very dense modification patterns in disordered protein regions, showed an equally high mutation rate as functional protein domains in cancer. Systematic PTMi spot identification highlighted more than 300 candidate proteins for combinatorial PTM regulation. The study emphasizes the importance of dataset integration in proteomic PTM studies to better predict modification impact on cellular signaling.
 Two-component signaling systems are essential for bacteria to adapt to changing environments. These systems typically involve a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue in a receiver (REC) domain. However, some REC domains lack this phosphorylatable Asp residue, and it is unclear how many of these divergent REC domains exist, what their functions are, and how they are regulated in its absence. In this study, we compiled all deposited REC domains missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue and renamed them as Aspartate-Less Receivers (ALRs). Our analysis shows that ALRs are surprisingly common and are enriched for when attached to more rare effector outputs. The available ALR atomic structures, combined with structural, biochemical, and genetic data of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to instead take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. This work defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains.
 The bacterial DnaA protein plays a crucial role in initiating the replication cycle, but it is unclear whether its accumulation controls the timing of initiation. To investigate this, researchers studied cells with an excess of ATP-DnaA and found no changes in the timing of replication. They suggest that while ATP-DnaA is necessary for initiation, other factors must be involved in the precise timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. The study also explored the roles of datA-dependent DnaA inactivation (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA. Loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein, indicating that compromised cell cycle machines perform less robustly. Overall, the findings suggest that ATP-DnaA is the motor that drives initiation, but other factors are required for precise timing.
 The rat demyelination (dmy) mutation is a unique model system to study myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS) as it leads to severe myelin breakdown after normal postnatal completion. Through positional cloning, we identified a G-to-A transition in the Mrs2 (MRS2 magnesium homeostasis factor) gene, which resulted in a novel splice acceptor site and functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA confirmed our findings. Mrs2 encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. The dmy/dmy rats exhibit major mitochondrial deficits, including a markedly elevated lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, a 60% reduction in ATP, and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed that MRS2 was dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and was ultrastructurally observed in the inner membrane of mitochondria. These observations suggest that dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for myelin maintenance.
 Leishmaniasis is a disease affecting 12 million people worldwide, with 2 million new cases each year. Leishmania amazonensis is a common cause of the disease in Brazil, leading to clinical forms ranging from localized to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The immune response of the host can impact Leishmania phenotype and virulence. In this study, we compared the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice to understand the effect of the host immune system on Leishmania proteins. Among the 44 differentially expressed spots, we identified proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases, some of which correspond to known Leishmania virulence factors such as OPB and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells probably restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. Conversely, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice. Our study may help identify potential virulence factors and ways to regulate their expression.Introduction:Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases reported every year. The disease is caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus, which are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected sandflies. Leishmania amazonensis is an important agent in Brazil, leading to clinical forms varying from localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The immune response of the host can impact Leishmania phenotype and virulence. In this study, we aimed to understand the effect of the host immune system on Leishmania proteins by comparing the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice.The murine model has been widely used to study various aspects of Leishmania infection, including the virulence of different parasite species and how different mouse strains respond to the same Leishmania species. Infections by Leishmania major have been the most commonly used model, allowing the definition of resistant and susceptible lineages such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c, which mount Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively. However, the response to Leishmania infection in athymic nude mice, particularly BALB/c nude mice, has not been thoroughly analyzed. Nude mice of C57BL/6 background have been shown not to develop lesions when infected by L. amazonensis, and had an expected reduced influx of T cells and monocytes in the site of infection. No similar analysis has been performed in BALB/c nude mice.One interesting issue in Leishmania infections is how the host immune response affects Leishmania phenotype and virulence. For instance, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in L. amazonensis amastigotes is an apoptotic feature that leads to parasite intracellular survival due to inhibition of macrophage inflammatory response. It has been shown that the host immune response modulates PS exposure by L. amazonensis amastigotes, with parasites derived from more susceptible BALB/c mice displaying more PS than parasites derived from less susceptible C57BL/6 mice. This correlation has been observed in human infections as well, with clinical parameters and experimental infection characteristics.Proteomics is an efficient method to compare protein profiles, and most studies have focused on abundance or post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, of proteins in amastigotes and promastigotes of the same Leishmania species, parasites sensitive and resistant to drugs, and proteins from different Leishmania species. Some works have also analyzed immunogenic proteins and secreted proteins. Due to the difficulty in obtaining robust amounts of virulent amastigotes from infected animals for in vitro analysis, most works have used axenic amastigotes for proteomics analysis. However, comparison of proteomes from lesion-derived amastigotes and axenic amastigotes have shown important differences.In this study, we analyzed the proteomes of mouse lesion-derived amastigotes using the protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis with fluorescent labeling (DIGE) and protein identification by mass spect
 A study of 498 isolates of the Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii species complex in Thailand revealed that the majority were C. neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their sources. The molecular types VNII, VNIV, VGI, and VGII were found less frequently. Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) analysis identified 20 sequence types in Thailand, with some being unique to the country. The Thai isolates are part of the global cryptococcal population genetic structure, with ST30 for C. gattii and ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172, and ST173 for C. neoformans being unique to Thailand. Most C. gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, which is identical to the less virulent Vancouver Island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The current study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.
 Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is commonly found in soil and water in tropical regions. Diabetes mellitus is the most significant risk factor for melioidosis, and prevention measures include avoiding contact with soil and water and drinking only boiled or bottled water. A multifaceted prevention program was evaluated in diabetic adults in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, using ten behavioral support groups and twelve behavior change techniques. Participants found the intervention beneficial, interesting, and engaging, particularly when they watched videos about melioidosis and saw demonstrations of protective gear. The proportion of participants who always wore boots while working in rice fields increased from 30% to 77%, and those who drank only boiled or bottled water increased from 43% to 86%. The program is highly acceptable to participants and can support behavior change. Policy makers should consider implementing the program in areas where melioidosis is endemic, and further research is needed on the effectiveness of using calendars with individual photographs and self-pledges as a reminder tool in behavior change interventions.
 Recent studies have shown that the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a dedicated mechanism for forgetting, which can be modulated by the learning task and the environment. This active form of forgetting is important for optimal decision making in a changing environment, as it allows the fly to adapt to new situations and reduce the risk of missing future rewards. In a stochastic environment where a stimulus may switch between being indicative of reward or punishment, an optimal agent shows forgetting with a rate that is linked to the time scale of changes in the environment. This active forgetting can also explain the different memory performances for multiple training sessions with varying inter-session intervals, as observed in a wide range of species from flies to humans. Overall, forgetting as a trait of optimality can be viewed as a dimension of adaptive behavior that is tuned to the environment to maximize subjective benefits.
 In this study, researchers investigated the factors contributing to miltefosine unresponsiveness in clinical isolates of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent. Miltefosine, an oral antileishmanial drug, has seen a significant decline in efficacy with high relapse rates in both VL and PKDL.The study compared parasites obtained from pretreatment cases (LdPreTx), relapsed cases (LdRelapse), and laboratory-adapted MIL-resistant parasites (LdM30). The results showed that LdRelapse parasites exhibited higher IC50 values at both the promastigote and intracellular amastigote levels, indicating a reduced susceptibility to miltefosine. Additionally, LdRelapse parasites had significantly higher percent infectivity and metacyclogenesis, suggesting an increased ability to survive within macrophages.Miltefosine accumulation was significantly lower in LdRelapse and LdM30 parasites, and these parasites showed better tolerance for oxidative stress, as indicated by lower MIL-induced ROS levels and higher intracellular thiol content. Furthermore, genes associated with oxidative stress, metabolic processes, and transporters showed modulated expression in LdRelapse and LdM30 parasites compared to LdPreTx parasites.These findings suggest that the parasites isolated from relapsed cases exhibit high infectivity, increased metacyclogenesis, reduced drug accumulation, and reconfigured metabolism to overcome the oxidative stress induced during MIL exposure. These factors may be contributing to the high relapse rate observed in MIL-treated VL and PKDL patients. Understanding the parasitic factors and molecular mechanisms involved in miltefosine unresponsiveness is crucial for monitoring drug efficacy and its longevity.
 Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a global health problem with over one-third of the world's population infected. Mycobacteria are successful pathogens that inhibit inflammation and arrest phago-lysosomal fusion to enhance their intracellular survival. In a previous study, we demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii dense granule antigen (GRA) 7 interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) via MyD88, enabling innate immune responses in macrophages and protecting against T. gondii infection. In this study, we further investigated the intracellular regulatory network of T. gondii GRA-induced ASC, PLD1, and PKCα signaling pathways to identify novel therapeutic modalities for tuberculosis.We found that PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of GRA7 is essential for interaction between GRA7 and ASC or PLD1, contributing to antimicrobial defense against MTB in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, PKCα phosphorylates Ser52 and Ser135 of GRA7, and the N-terminal of GRA7 (GRA7-I) interacts with the PYD domain of ASC, while GRA7-III interacts with the PX domain of phospholipase D1 (PLD1), facilitating its enzyme activity, phago-lysosomal maturation, and subsequent antimicrobial activity in a GRA7-III (Ser135) phosphorylation-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that GRA7 plays fine-tuning roles in the activation of host-directed therapies (HDTs) and innate immune machineries through direct binding with ASC or PLD1 and may provide a unique opportunity for therapeutic interventions against tuberculosis.
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic in 98 countries, with approximately 2 million cases and 59,000 deaths annually. In Brazil, which is one of the most severely affected countries, reported incidence data for cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL) leishmaniasis covering a 10-year period (2001-2010) were analyzed using Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models. The models were fitted using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) for fast approximate Bayesian inference and Bayesian variable selection to determine the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors. For both types of leishmaniasis, precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were identified as important risk factors. The predicted number of cases in 2010 were 30,189 (SD: 7,676) for CL and 4,889 (SD: 288) for VL. The highest numbers of infected people were predicted in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. These high-resolution incidence maps can help prioritize intervention areas and optimize resource allocation for leishmaniasis control efforts.
 The olfactory bulb (OB), the first station in the brain where odor information is processed, has been compared to the retina due to its primary circuit and the stability of stimulus representation at early stages of processing. However, recent studies suggest that early stimulus representation in the OB can be shaped by previously derived meaning, allowing for a simplified yet biased interpretation of incoming odor stimuli. In this study, researchers investigated the activity of mitral cells, the output cells of the OB, during an odor discrimination task. They found that mitral cells changed their responses transiently, increasing their ability to convey information necessary to discriminate between closely related odors. Remarkably, a switch between which of the two odors was rewarded caused mitral cells to switch the polarity of their divergent responses. These results redefine the function of the OB as a transiently modifiable filter, shaping early odor representations in behaviorally meaningful ways.
 In the complex world of cellular regulation, transcription and splicing have long been considered separate processes. However, recent research suggests that these two processes are interconnected. In a groundbreaking study, researchers have constructed a transcription-splicing integrated network to explore the interplay between these processes.The network includes human proteins belonging to three groups: transcription factors, splicing factors, and kinases. The nodes were wired by instances of predicted transcriptional and alternative splicing regulation. Analysis of the network revealed a pervasive cross-regulation among the nodes, specifically splicing factors are significantly more connected by alternative splicing regulatory edges relative to the two other subgroups. Transcription factors, on the other hand, are more extensively controlled by transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, splicing factors are the most regulated of the three regulatory groups and are subject to extensive combinatorial control by alternative splicing and transcriptional regulation.These findings suggest a new regulatory paradigm, postulating that gene expression regulation of the master regulators in the cell is predominantly achieved by cross-regulation. This new perspective may provide insights into the complex interplay between different regulators and their target genes, which is crucial for understanding the causes of disease states.
 In this study, researchers aimed to identify new genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer in East Asian women by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls. After analyzing over 690,000 SNPs, they identified three SNPs that showed consistent associations with breast cancer risk across all four stages of the study. The top SNP, rs9485372, is located near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene and had a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. The other two SNPs, rs9383951, located in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene, and rs7107217, located at 11q24.3, also showed consistent associations in each of the four stages. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372, near the TAB2 gene, and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility in East Asian women.
 A novel technique has been developed to assess the confidence levels of interactions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks obtained from experimental studies. This method utilizes a currently the best fitting network model for PPI networks, geometric graphs, and achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. The approach was used to predict new interactions in the human PPI network and validate a statistically significant portion of the predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. The data and Matlab code implementing the methods are freely available online.Protein-protein interactions are essential for understanding complex biological systems. However, the data produced by high-throughput techniques such as yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem affinity purification (TAP) have very high levels of false positives and false negatives. For example, the false positive rate for Y2H could be as high as 64%, and the false negative rate may range from 43% to 71% for TAP.To address this challenge, a novel technique has been presented to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks obtained from experimental studies. This method utilizes a currently the best fitting network model for PPI networks, geometric graphs, and achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%.The approach was used to predict new interactions in the human PPI network and validate a statistically significant portion of the predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. The data and Matlab code implementing the methods are freely available online.Protein-protein interaction networks are modeled as graphs, where nodes represent proteins and edges represent interactions between the corresponding proteins. Understanding these complex networks is a fundamental issue in systems biology. Of particular importance are protein-protein interaction networks. In PPI networks, nodes correspond to proteins, and two nodes are linked by an edge if the corresponding proteins can interact. The topology of PPI networks can give new insight into the function of individual proteins, protein complexes, and cellular machinery as a complex system.Advances in high-throughput techniques such as yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H), tandem affinity purification (TAP), and mass spectrometric protein complex identification (HMS-PCI) are producing a growing amount of experimental PPI data for many organisms. However, reducing the level of noise in PPI networks and assessing the confidence of each interaction is an essential task.Two recent studies provided two high-quality PPI data sets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gavin et al. defined "socio-affinity" scores measuring the log-odds of the number of times two proteins are observed together, relative to their frequency in the data set. They use not only direct bait-prey connections but also indirect prey-prey relationships. In this, two proteins are each identified as preys in a purification in which a third protein is used as bait. Krogan et al. used machine learning methods, including Bayesian networks and boosted stump decision trees, to define confidence scores for potential interactions. These scores are based on direct bait-prey observations. They used a Markov clustering algorithm to define protein complexes.From the original 12,122 interactions from these two studies in the General Repository of Interaction Data (BioGRID), they discarded 7,504 as being of low confidence. Applying their metric, they discovered 4,456 new interactions, that were not among the original 12,122 interactions, and produced a set of 9,074 interactions with accuracy comparable to the accuracy of small-scale experimental methods.In this paper, the high-confidence data set produced by merging the two data sets was used to test the approach. In recent years, several random graph models have been proposed to model PPI networks: Erdös-Rényi random graphs, scale-free graphs, geometric random graphs, and stickiness-index-based models. The technique presented in this paper is one of the first to use a network model of PPI networks for purposes other than just generating synthetic data.A geometric graph model was used for assessing the confidence levels of known interactions in PPI networks and predicting novel ones. The new approach was compared with existing PPI network post-processing techniques in the final section. Proteins form interactions with each other based on their biochemical properties. Mathematically, we can consider these properties to be dimensions of some abstract metric space. Therefore, PPI networks reside in some biochemical space with a finite number
 Buruli ulcer, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a chronic skin disease associated with the production of the cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin mycolactone. While histopathological analyses suggest that the bacteria mainly reside outside of cells, there is evidence for an early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. In an experimental mouse model, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was found to play a critical role in early host defense against M. ulcerans infections. IFN-γ knockout mice displayed faster progression of the infection, with more extensive tissue necrosis, edema formation, and a higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that mice lacking IFN-γ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. These findings support the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be applicable to Buruli ulcer.Buruli ulcer is a progressive skin disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. The disease primarily affects West African rural communities but has also been reported in other parts of the world. The pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer is mainly attributed to mycolactone, a macrolide exotoxin produced by M. ulcerans. Mycolactone is essential for bacterial virulence and is highly cytotoxic for a wide range of mammalian cell types. Despite this, sera of individuals living in Buruli ulcer endemic regions frequently contain M. ulcerans-specific antibodies, indicating that many individuals develop immune responses without developing clinical disease.Histopathological analyses of advanced Buruli ulcer lesions have demonstrated a mainly extracellular localization of the toxin-producing acid-fast bacilli. However, there is growing evidence for an early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. This has led researchers to investigate whether interferon-γ (IFN-γ) might play an important role in containing M. ulcerans infections.In an experimental Buruli ulcer mouse model, IFN-γ was found to be a critical regulator of early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infections. IFN-γ knockout mice displayed a faster progression of the infection compared to wild-type mice, as evidenced by faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and edema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that mice lacking IFN-γ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans.These findings demonstrate a prominent role of IFN-γ in early defense against M. ulcerans infection and support the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for Buruli ulcer.Keywords: Buruli ulcer, Mycobacterium ulcerans, mycolactone, interferon-γ, immune defense, early intra-macrophage growth phase, vaccine development.
 The hippocampus, a crucial brain region for memory storage and retrieval, has long been studied using the framework of autoassociative memory networks. This theory assumes that the hippocampus operates as an autoassociator, retrieving previously stored memory traces from noisy or partial cues through pattern completion. However, this framework makes simplifying assumptions about synaptic plasticity rules and the dynamics of the network during recall.One such assumption is the use of additive learning rules, which make the analysis of the circuit tractable but violate Dale's principle by allowing synaptic weights to grow arbitrarily large or switch sign. Metaplasticity, a mechanism that modulates synaptic plasticity, can help maintain synapses within the relevant biological range. The cascade model of metaplasticity, in particular, enables information to be stored in bounded synapses almost as efficiently as additive learning rules.Despite this advantage, metaplastic synapses have been found to perform equally poorly when the amount of recalled information is measured instead of the attractor dynamics used during retrieval. This raises the question of how efficient memory recall is possible from more realistic synapses that suffer from a bounded dynamical range.To address this question, a theoretical framework for memory storage and recall with bounded synapses was developed. The recall of a previously stored pattern from a noisy recall cue and limited-capacity synapses was formulated as a probabilistic inference problem, and neural dynamics were derived to implement approximate inference algorithms to solve this problem efficiently. For binary synapses with metaplastic states, it was demonstrated for the first time that memories can be efficiently read out with biologically plausible network dynamics that are completely constrained by the synaptic plasticity rule and the statistics of the stored patterns and of the recall cue.This theory organizes a wide range of existing data about the regulation of excitability, feedback inhibition, and network oscillations in area CA3 into a coherent framework and makes novel and directly testable predictions that can guide future experiments.
 In the field of neuroscience, understanding the behavior of neural networks at the mesoscopic level, which involves networks composed of a few tens of neurons, is crucial for linking single neuron activity to behavior. However, mathematical methods that accurately describe such networks are still limited, preventing progress in understanding neural dynamics at these intermediate scales. In this study, a novel approach is developed to systematically analyze the dynamics of arbitrarily small neural networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. The analysis identifies complex dynamics caused by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations that emerge through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, revealing qualitative and previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. This ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity is important for reducing the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing.
 In the field of biology, understanding how complex tissue shapes arise through growth is a major problem. Two theories suggest that orientations are specified through stresses in the tissue (axiality-based system) or independently through molecular signaling (polarity-based system). While the axiality-based system has been explored through computational modeling, a polarity-based system called the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework was recently developed.The GPT framework treats tissue as a continuous material, and polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and are anchored in regions called tissue polarity organizers. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are then specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature.The GPT framework was illustrated by applying it to a growing Snapdragon flower, and it was proposed that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth, which are a key feature of polarity-based systems, have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes. The underlying hypotheses of the GPT-framework can be tested through computational simulation.
 Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg Anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by eye malformations, most commonly anophthalmia, and post-axial oligosyndactyly of the limbs. Homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene, which encodes a BMP antagonist, have been identified in eight unrelated families with OAS. Four of these mutations are nonsense, two are frame-shift, and two are missense. The missense mutations are both in the second Thyroglobulin Type-1 (Tg1) domain of the protein. SMOC1 shows site- and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. A targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of Smoc1 in mice results in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly and eye malformations, providing a phenocopy of the human disease. The loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for both the limb and eye phenotype in humans and mice.
 HIV infection is linked to high rates of osteopenia and osteoporosis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our recent research in a rat model of HIV infection revealed that bone loss was associated with increased B cell expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor-activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), while expression of its physiological moderator, osteoprotegerin (OPG), decreased.To translate these findings to humans, we conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV-uninfected and antiretroviral therapy-naïve HIV-infected individuals. We found that HIV-infected individuals had higher bone resorption and osteopenia, with increased B cell expression of RANKL and decreased expression of OPG. The B cell RANKL/OPG ratio correlated significantly with total hip and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected subjects, but not at the lumbar spine.B cell subset analyses revealed significant HIV-related increases in RANKL-expressing naïve, resting memory, and exhausted tissue-like memory B cells. By contrast, the net B cell OPG decrease in HIV-infected individuals resulted from a significant decline in resting memory B cells, a population containing a high frequency of OPG-expressing cells, concurrent with a significant increase in exhausted tissue-like memory B cells, a population with a lower frequency of OPG-expressing cells.These findings validate our pre-clinical findings of an immuno-centric mechanism for accelerated HIV-induced bone loss, aligned with B cell dysfunction.
 In this study, researchers investigated the role of neutrophils and macrophages in eliminating bacteria that cannot be reached by phagocytosis in the zebrafish embryo notochord infection model. They found that neutrophils, but not macrophages, are instrumental for bacterial clearance and larva survival. The bactericidal action of neutrophils relies on the NADPH oxidase-dependent production of superoxide and is independent of NO synthase or myeloperoxidase. This discovery reveals a new host defense mechanism against bacteria that cannot be reached by phagocytes.
 Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly infectious pathogen that causes significant economic losses through the international trade of animals and animal products. FMDV capsids, which are unstable below pH 6.5, release their genome into the host cell from an acidic compartment, such as an endosome, and dissociate into pentamers. However, unlike other members of the Picornaviridae family, such as enteroviruses, there is no evidence of an expanded intermediate capsid state for FMDV. Instead, the capsid appears to simply dissociate into pentamers.In this study, researchers present the 8-Å resolution structure of isolated dissociated pentamers of FMDV, which lack VP4. They also found that these pentamers re-associate into a rigid, icosahedrally symmetric assembly, enabling their structure to be solved at higher resolution (5.2 Å). In this assembly, the pentamers unexpectedly associate 'inside out,' but still with their exposed hydrophobic edges buried. Stabilizing interactions occur between the HI loop of VP2 and its symmetry related partners at the icosahedral 3-fold axes, and between the BC and EF loops of VP3 with the VP2 βB-strand and the CD loop at the 2-fold axes. The relatively extensive but subtle structural rearrangement towards the periphery of the dissociated pentamer compared to that in the mature virus provides insight into the mechanism of dissociation of FMDV and the marked difference in antigenicity.
 Buruli ulcer (BU) is a severe skin disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The disease can progress from a painless papule to a destructive ulcer with undermined edges. The exact cause of BU is still unknown, but it is believed that the immune system plays a critical role in controlling the infection. Autophagy, a cellular process that helps in the clearance of intracellular pathogens, has been identified as an important immune response against BU.Recent studies have suggested that genetic variants in certain autophagy-related genes may influence susceptibility to BU and its progression to severe phenotypes. In this study, researchers investigated the association between three specific autophagy-related genes, NOD2, PARK2, and ATG16L1, and BU risk and phenotypes.The study involved 208 BU patients, 70.2% of whom had an ulcerative form and 28% in the severe WHO category 3 phenotype, and 300 healthy endemic controls. The researchers found that the rs1333955 SNP in PARK2 was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to BU (odds ratio (OR) = 1.43; P = 0.05). Additionally, both the rs9302752 and rs2066842 SNPs in NOD2 were found to significantly increase the predisposition of patients to develop category 3 (OR = 2.23; P = 0.02 and OR = 12.7; P = 0.03, respectively). Conversely, the rs2241880 SNP in ATG16L1 was found to significantly protect patients from presenting the ulcer phenotype (OR = 0.35; P = 0.02).These findings suggest that specific genetic variants in autophagy-related genes can influence susceptibility to BU and its progression to severe phenotypes. Understanding the role of these genes in the immune response to M. ulcerans infection may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of BU.
 Plants produce vast amounts of lignocellulosic biomass annually, which is metabolized by microbes in various environments for carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes. Clostridium phytofermentans, a soil bacterium, is one of the dominant microbes in the human gut microbiome and a top candidate for transforming cellulosic biomass into fuels and commodities. This study demonstrates a method to analyze how C. phytofermentans ferments plant polysaccharides, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans, using carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening. The results reveal that these polysaccharides are fermented with varying efficiencies and that the bacterium responds by up-regulating specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. The 56 up-regulated CAZymes were purified, and their activities showed that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with divergent rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. CAZymes were then tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This study advances our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, which is essential for carbon flow in the environment, healthy human nutrition, and industrial processes.
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a genetic component. Over 800 genetic association studies have been conducted to identify PD risk loci, but the results have been difficult to interpret due to conflicting findings and the large volume of data. To address this issue, researchers have created PDGene, an online database that comprehensively collects and meta-analyzes all published genetic association studies in PD.The database includes data from over 800 studies and over seven million polymorphisms. Meta-analyses revealed eleven loci that showed genome-wide significant association with PD risk: BST1, CCDC62/HIP1R, DGKQ/GAK, GBA, LRRK2, MAPT, MCCC1/LAMP3, PARK16, SNCA, STK39, and SYT11/RAB25. In addition, a novel PD susceptibility locus in ITGA8 was identified. PDGene is regularly updated and provides a valuable resource for researchers in the field.In the context of public health and epidemiology, PDGene is an important tool for understanding the genetic basis of PD and for identifying new targets for prevention and treatment. The database also serves as a valuable example for other complex diseases.In summary, PDGene is a freely available online database that provides an exhaustive account of all published genetic association studies in PD. The database includes up-to-date summary statistics for overlapping DNA sequence variants and has identified eleven loci that show genome-wide significant association with PD risk. PDGene is an essential resource for researchers in the field and has implications for understanding the genetic basis of PD and for developing new prevention and treatment strategies.
 In the plant model system Arabidopsis thaliana, auxin biosynthesis through indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) is essential for root development and requires redundant TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1) and TAA1-RELATED (TAR) genes. In the monocotyledon Brachypodium distachyon, a promoter T-DNA insertion in the BdTAR2L gene results in reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity, creating a hypomorphic Bdtar2l allele. Surprisingly, Bdtar2lhypo mutants display elongated seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation, which is also observed in stronger Bdtar2l alleles and upon treatment with the TAA1/TAR inhibitor L-kynerunine. Contrary to expectations, L-kynerunine-treated and Bdtar2l roots exhibit elevated auxin levels, which is not due to compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways. Instead, expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for conversion of IPA to auxin, is increased in Bdtar2l mutants. This suggests that ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin bios synthesis in an IPA-dependent manner to confer auxin levels that are sub-optimal for root cell elongation. These findings reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk as compared to Arabidopsis.
 Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium commonly found in soil and water. Diabetes mellitus is the leading risk factor for melioidosis, and prevention measures include avoiding contact with soil and water and drinking only boiled or bottled water. A multifaceted prevention program was evaluated in diabetic adults in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, using ten behavioral support groups and twelve behavior change techniques. Participants found the intervention beneficial, interesting, and engaging, particularly when they watched videos about melioidosis and saw demonstrations of protective gear. The proportion of participants who always wore boots while working in rice fields increased from 30% to 77%, and those who drank only boiled or bottled water increased from 43% to 86%. The program is highly acceptable to participants and can support behavior change. Policy makers should consider implementing the program in areas where melioidosis is endemic, and further research is needed on the effectiveness of using calendars with individual photographs and self-pledges as a reminder tool.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that has seen a resurgence in recent years. Two strains of CHIKV, A226 and 226V, have been identified, and they have different effects on the sensitivity of diagnostic assays. The CTK lateral flow test and MAC-ELISA assays using the A226 strain detected IgM in sera from the first outbreak earlier than those using the 226V strain. However, the CTK lateral flow test was delayed in detecting IgM in sera from the second outbreak. The MAC-ELISA assay using the 226V strain detected IgM in the second outbreak sera one day earlier than that using the A226 strain. The EUROIMMUN IFA assay and the two commercial CTK lateral flow tests had 100% specificity, and the in-house MAC-ELISAs had 95.6% specificity. The probe-based real time RT-PCR method was found to be 10 times more sensitive than the SYBR Green method for detecting CHIKV RNA. The findings demonstrate the importance of evaluating different diagnostic assays before their application in clinical and operational settings.Copy number variations (CNVs) are a significant source of genetic variation in humans and have been increasingly studied for disease association. The GSTT1 gene, which encodes the cytosolic detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase theta 1, has been extensively studied for cancer susceptibility. However, clear conclusions have not been reached due to the presence of a confounding effect from another CNV at the same locus, the GSTT2B deletion polymorphism. The GSTT2B deletion polymorphism is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the neighboring GSTT1 deletion polymorphism in the Caucasian population, and alleles harboring a single deletion are significantly overrepresented. The deletion alleles are almost certainly the derived ones, as they are not present in chimpanzees. Extremely low GSTT2 mRNA expression is associated with the GSTT2B deletion, suggesting an influence of the deletion on the flanking region and loss of GSTT2 function. Genome-wide LD analysis between deletion polymorphisms further points to the uniqueness of the two deletions. These results show a complex genomic organization and emphasize the importance of detailed structural characterization for disease association studies.Chromosomes are long and densely packed polymers, and understanding their 3D organization is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Developing adequate models and simulation methods to investigate the multi-spatial and temporal scales of such macromolecules is a significant challenge. Here, a generic strategy is proposed to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for the polymer entanglement length and volumic density. The simulation scheme captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system and tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining levels, offering a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and study long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. The strategy is applied to investigate the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R in drosophila during one cell cycle, revealing that a combination of the coarse-graining
 Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that replicates in mammalian cells within a parasitophorous vacuole, which does not fuse with any host organelles. To acquire nutrients, Toxoplasma attracts host organelles to the vacuole, specifically lipid droplets (LD). LD are cytoplasmic structures containing neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, and are involved in various cellular processes, including energy storage and lipid homeostasis. Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells that are depleted of LD or have impaired TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes progressively increase until the onset of parasite replication. Toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host LD and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and LD. The parasite intercepts and internalizes within the PV host LD, some of which remain associated with Rab7, forming an intravacuolar network of membranes. Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host LD. Parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV, suggesting a major contribution of the IVN for host LD processing in the PV and lipid content release. Toxoplasma's ability to access and utilize host LD is crucial for its intracellular development and survival.
 During embryonic development, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning. In Drosophila, BMP signaling is transduced through the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. In this study, researchers combined RNA-seq with ChIP-seq for Mad and Brinker to decipher the BMP-responsive transcriptional network underlying differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm. They identified multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. Manipulation of EGF signaling levels revealed that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription, establishing a balance between BMP activity and that of the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway. The findings provide insight into the self-regulating property of the BMP gene network and its relevance to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.
 Schistosoma mansoni, the major causative agent of schistosomiasis, takes advantage of host signals to complete its development in the human body. One such signal is Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), a human cytokine involved in skin inflammatory responses. Although the effects of TNF-α on the adult parasite's metabolism and egg-laying process have been previously described, a comprehensive assessment of the TNF-α pathway and its downstream molecular effects is lacking.In this study, researchers describe a possible TNF-α receptor (SmTNFR) homolog gene in S. mansoni and reveal that it encodes a complete receptor sequence composed of 599 amino acids, with four cysteine-rich domains as described for TNFR members. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed that SmTNFR is most highly expressed in cercariae, 3.5 times higher than in adult worms.To simulate parasite exposure to human cytokine during penetration of the skin, schistosomula were exposed to human TNF-α just 3 hours after cercariae-to-schistosomula in vitro transformation, and large-scale gene expression measurements were performed with microarrays. A total of 548 genes with significantly altered expression were detected in schistosomula, and 1,857 genes were altered in adult worms. Interestingly, the set of genes altered in adults was different from that of schistosomula, with 58 genes in common, representing 3% of altered genes in adults and 11% in 3-hour-old early schistosomula.The researchers describe the possible molecular elements and targets involved in human TNF-α effect on S. mansoni, highlighting the mechanism by which recently transformed schistosomula may sense and respond to this host mediator at the site of cercarial penetration into the skin. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism underpinning pathogenicity and stress responses in M. oryzae and will also serve as a guide in studying the role of individual TF genes and the coordination of their expression in controlling development, pathogenicity, and abiotic stress responses in M. oryzae.
 In this study, researchers found that a subpopulation of CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3+) cells from individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) can inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) through the production of a soluble factor called Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (D4GDI). D4GDI is a small GTP-binding protein that enhances production of IL-1β, TNF-α, and ROS, and increases apoptosis of M. tb-infected MDMs. D4GDI was also found to be concentrated at the site of disease in tuberculosis patients, with higher levels detected in pleural fluid than in serum. However, in response to M. tb, PBMC from tuberculosis patients produced less D4GDI than PBMC from individuals with LTBI. M. tb-expanded CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3+) cells and D4GDI induced intracellular M. tb to express the dormancy survival regulator DosR and DosR-dependent genes, suggesting that D4GDI induces a non-replicating state in the pathogen. This study provides the first evidence that a subpopulation of CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3+) cells enhances immunity to M. tb, and that production of D4GDI by this subpopulation inhibits M. tb growth.
 Acinetobacter baumannii, a common opportunistic pathogen, has recently become resistant to multiple drugs, making it a major health concern. Ethanol has been shown to increase the virulence of A. baumannii in Dictyostelium discoideum and Caenorhabditis elegans models of infection. To understand how ethanol affects A. baumannii, researchers used RNA-Seq to analyze the transcriptional profile of the bacterium grown in the presence or absence of ethanol. They identified 70 genes whose expression is altered by ethanol, including genes encoding metabolic enzymes, stress proteins, and phosphate transport systems. One of these genes, plc1, which encodes an A. baumannii-specific phospholipase C, was found to be important for virulence as a deletion mutant exhibited a reduction in A. baumannii-induced cytotoxicity of epithelial cells. Overall, this study highlights the importance of RNA-Seq in identifying key modulators of bacterial pathogenesis and suggests that the effect of ethanol on A. baumannii virulence is multifactorial and includes a general stress response and other specific components such as phospholipase C.
 In the field of biology, particularly in the study of microorganisms and human pathogens, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosis. NGS provides a fast, specific, and relatively unbiased method of capturing the full spectrum of macro- and microorganisms in any sample. However, the dependence on reference databases for diagnosis presents challenges, as no database contains the full spectrum of all potential human pathogens and existing reference databases have been found to contain contamination.To address this problem, researchers have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This software was applied to a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes, resulting in a database of "clean" eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools.Using this new database, researchers have demonstrated better sensitivity in identifying eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives. This is particularly important for the diagnosis of human infections, where accurate identification of pathogens is crucial for effective treatment and patient care.In conclusion, NGS is a promising tool for human pathogen diagnosis, but the availability and quality of genomes for comparison is essential for accurate identification. The development of bioinformatics systems for eliminating contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens is a significant step forward in improving the reliability and accuracy of NGS in pathogen diagnostics.
 The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes important for coronary artery disease (CAD) using whole-genome expression profiles from multiple organs. The study used a modified version of a two-way clustering approach, processing all mRNA signals within one organ to define tissue clusters based on associations between mRNA signals across all patients. In the second step, patients were clustered according to the mRNA signals within each tissue cluster to identify signals related to clinical phenotypes. The clinical endpoint was the extent of coronary atherosclerotic lesions as judged from the degree of coronary stenosis, measured by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). The study comprised 114 carefully characterized patients and a compendium of 278 global gene-expression profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues isolated during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The study found that one cluster, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module), was important for atherosclerosis development and was genetically enriched with CAD risk by 1.8-fold. The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, and subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and the expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2–deficient arterial wall supported this notion. The A-module merits further attention in CAD research.
 In a series of experiments, researchers investigated the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on human visual perception. Using multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches, they found that each perceptual report is influenced by opposite biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes. Low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, while decisional traces attract perceptual reports toward the recent past. These findings suggest that human visual perception is constantly shaped by two contrasting forces, and that the persistence of past decisions plays a significant role in shaping current perceptual reports. The results are consistent with a Two-process model of serial dependence, which proposes that the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. The study provides a unified account of serial dependence and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the interaction between past experiences and current perception.
 In this study, researchers investigated the mechanism behind the spontaneous transition from cardiac electrical alternans (CEA) to re-entry and the role of sodium channels in this process. CEA is a clinical biomarker for predicting cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death, but the underlying mechanism for its transition to arrhythmias is incompletely understood.Using multiscale rabbit ventricular models, the researchers found that CEA can evolve into either concordant or discordant action potential (AP) conduction alternans, depending on tissue AP duration and conduction velocity restitution properties. Discordant alternans can cause conduction failure and is promoted by impaired sodium channels with either reduced or increased channel current. In a two-dimensional homogeneous tissue model, a combined effect of rate- and curvature-dependent conduction velocity broke-up alternating wavefronts at localised points, facilitating a spontaneous transition from CEA to re-entry. Tissue inhomogeneity or anisotropy further promoted break-up of re-entry, leading to multiple wavelets. Similar observations have been seen in human atrial cellular and tissue models.The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanism by which cellular CEA spontaneously evolves into cardiac arrhythmias and demonstrate the important pro-arrhythmic role of impaired sodium channel activity. These results are model-independent and have potential clinical relevance.
 Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are DNA viruses that cause major human cancers, making the development of new prevention methods, such as vaccines and microbicides, a priority. HPV infection is closely linked to the differentiation state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus only produced in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment. It has long been unclear why HPV establishes its infection in the basal layer of stratified epithelium. In this study, researchers used chemical biology approaches to reveal that cell cycle progression through mitosis is crucial for HPV infection. They found that the recipient cell must enter M phase (mitosis) for HPV infection to occur, while late M phase inhibitors had no effect. This suggests that host cells need to pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. These findings provide insight into why HPV initially establishes infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia and have implications for HPV control.
 Orofacial clefts, including cleft lip and palate, are among the most common birth defects, affecting one in every 700 newborns. The causes of this heterogeneous condition are not fully understood, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role. In this study, researchers identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene as a cause of syndromic orofacial clefting. HYAL2 encodes hyaluronidase 2, an enzyme that degrades extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. The gene mutations destabilize the molecule, leading to dramatically reduced HYAL2 protein levels. Consistent with the clinical presentation in affected individuals, investigations of Hyal2-/- mice revealed craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate. Additionally, cor triatriatum sinister and hearing loss, identified in a proportion of Hyal2-/- mice, were also found as incompletely penetrant features in affected humans. These findings identify a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting in humans and mice and define the first molecular cause of human cor triatriatum sinister, illustrating the fundamental importance of HYAL2 and hyaluronan turnover for normal human and mouse development.
 Hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, can cause significant damage to the developing human brain, leading to chronic neurodevelopmental impairments. While recent studies in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that hypoxia causes axon pathfinding errors in certain interneurons and motor neurons, it is unclear if similar effects occur in a vertebrate nervous system. In this study, researchers investigated the effects of developmental hypoxia on axon pathfinding in zebrafish, a common model organism in developmental neuroscience. They found that hypoxia disrupts pathfinding of forebrain neurons in zebrafish, leading to errors in which commissural axons fail to cross the midline. This results from the activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway and can be mimicked by chemical inducers or constitutively active hif1α. Blocking transcriptional activation by hif1α helps prevent the guidance errors. The researchers identified ephrinB2a as a target of hif1 pathway activation and found that knocking down ephrinB2a rescues the guidance errors. They also showed that the receptor ephA4a is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons and that ephrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Finally, they found that magnesium sulfate, which is used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2. These results demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia and support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium.
 Filarial nematodes, such as those that cause lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, form a mutualistic relationship with the endosymbiont Wolbachia. Depletion of Wolbachia leads to profound defects in nematode development, fertility, and viability, making it a promising approach for treating filarial diseases. However, the basis for this mutualistic relationship is not well understood. In this study, whole mount confocal microscopy was used to observe the consequences of Wolbachia depletion on host nematode cellular and nuclear structure. The results showed that an immediate response to Wolbachia depletion is extensive apoptosis in the adult germline and embryos, as well as microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae (L4). Surprisingly, apoptosis occurs in the majority of embryonic cells that had not been infected prior to antibiotic treatment. No apoptosis occurs in the hypodermal chords, which are populated with large numbers of Wolbachia. The induction of apoptosis upon Wolbachia depletion is non-cell autonomous and suggests the involvement of factors originating from Wolbachia in the hypodermal chords. The pattern of apoptosis correlates closely with the nematode tissues and processes initially perturbed following depletion of Wolbachia, such as embryogenesis and long-term sterilization, which are sustained for several months until the premature death of the adult worms. These observations provide a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.
 Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are negative-strand RNA viruses that can cause infections in various species, including birds, pigs, and humans. Swine are proposed as a "mixing vessel" for generating reassortants of avian and mammalian IAVs that could pose a risk to mammals, including humans. However, how a transmissible reassortant emerges in swine is not well understood. In a recent study, researchers analyzed 571 isolates recovered from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues of co-housed pigs infected with avian H1N1 IAV and swine H3N2 IAV. They identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants, with the largest genomic diversity found in viruses recovered from lower respiratory tract tissues. Reassortants from lower respiratory tracts had the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells, and the cold temperature in swine nasal cells seemed to select the type of reassortant viruses shed by the pigs. One reassortant in nasal wash samples was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tract tissues and was confirmed to be transmitted efficiently between pigs. The findings suggest that during mixed infections of avian and swine IAVs, genetic reassortments are likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract, and tissue tropism is an important factor selecting for a transmissible reassortant.
 The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is a large-scale international initiative aimed at discovering and defining functional elements encoded in the human genome. The project, which includes seven ENCODE Data Production Centers, uses multiple complementary types of genome-wide data, including identification and quantification of RNA species, mapping of protein-coding regions, delineation of chromatin and DNA accessibility and structure, mapping of histone modifications and transcription factor binding sites, and measurement of DNA methylation. The data are collected by a central Data Coordination Center and released rapidly to the public through a web-accessible database, providing a valuable resource for the scientific community to interpret the human genome and improve health. The ENCODE Project has focused on completing annotations of genes and their RNA transcripts, as well as transcriptional regulatory regions, and has found that approximately 59% of interspecific inversions in the melanogaster species subgroup of Drosophila are associated with inverted duplications of protein-coding genes or other nonrepetitive sequences present at the breakpoint regions. This suggests a mechanism of staggered breaks, either isochromatid or chromatid, as the most parsimonious explanation for the origin of inversions in this group. The project has also found evidence for widespread breakpoint recycling and disrupted expression domains in D. yakuba, bringing into question their potential adaptive significance. Overall, the ENCODE Project is providing valuable insights into the functional elements of the human genome and the mechanisms underlying genome evolution.
 In the late 17th and 18th centuries, European and African descendants settled in the continental US, coming into contact with established Native American populations. This contact resulted in significant admixture among these groups, leading to a reservoir of Native American ancestry in the modern US population outside of recognized indigenous communities. In this study, we analyzed the patterns of Native American admixture in three large genetic ancestry groups in the US population: African descendants, Western European descendants, and Spanish descendants.Native American ancestry in the modern African descendant population does not align with local geography but instead forms a single group with origins in the southeastern US, consistent with the Great Migration of the early 20th century. Western European descendants show Native American ancestry that tracks their geographic origins across the US, indicative of ongoing contact during westward expansion. Spanish descendants can be resolved into distinct local groups formed by more recent migration from Mexico and Puerto Rico, with an anomalous pattern of Native American ancestry from the US southwest, most likely corresponding to the Nuevomexicanos, descendants of early Spanish settlers to the region.Nuevomexicanos are less admixed than nearby Mexican-American individuals, with more European and less Native American and African ancestry. While they do show demonstrable Sephardic Jewish ancestry, the fraction is no greater than seen for other New World Spanish descendant populations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex history of population movements and admixture in the US.
 Schistosoma mansoni, the major causative agent of schistosomiasis, takes advantage of host signals to complete its development in the human body. One such signal is Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), a human cytokine involved in skin inflammatory responses. While the effect of TNF-α on the adult parasite's metabolism and egg-laying process has been previously described, a comprehensive assessment of the TNF-α pathway and its downstream molecular effects is lacking.In this study, researchers describe a possible TNF-α receptor (TNFR) homolog gene in S. mansoni (SmTNFR). SmTNFR encodes a complete receptor sequence composed of 599 amino acids and contains four cysteine-rich domains, as described for TNFR members. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that SmTNFR is most highly expressed in cercariae, 3.5 times higher than in adult worms.Through an in silico analysis, downstream members of the known human TNF-α pathway were identified in S. mansoni, revealing a possible TNF-α signaling pathway in the parasite. To simulate parasite exposure to human cytokine during penetration of the skin, schistosomula were exposed to human TNF-α just 3 hours after cercariae-to-schistosomula in vitro transformation. Large-scale gene expression measurements were performed with microarrays, revealing a total of 548 genes with significantly altered expression in schistosomula compared to control parasites. Similarly, treatment of adult worms with TNF-α caused a significantly altered expression of 1857 genes. Interestingly, the set of genes altered in adults is different from that of schistosomula, with 58 genes in common, representing 3% of altered genes in adults and 11% in 3-hour-old early schistosomula.This work increases the number of known signaling pathways of the parasite and opens new perspectives into understanding the molecular components of TNF-α response and potentially interfering with parasite-host interaction.
 Scorpion venom causes systemic inflammation, including insulin resistance, through the activation of TNF-α and the subsequent increase in Map4k4 expression in adipose tissue. Androctonus australis hector (Aah) venom, in particular, has been shown to induce insulin resistance in mice. The findings from this study suggest that TNF-α inhibitors could be used as a complementary treatment to anti-scorpion venom immunotherapy to reduce Map4k4 expression and restore glucose uptake in adipose tissue. This could potentially improve outcomes for individuals envenomed by Aah and other scorpions.
 Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a significant cause of foodborne illness, and its intracellular survival in host cells is crucial for its virulence. In this study, researchers investigated the role of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) in EHEC's intracellular survival and virulence. They identified a novel T6SS effector protein, KatN, which is a Mn-catalase secreted by EHEC to antagonize ROS of eukaryotic host cells and facilitate its survival. The researchers found that KatN is secreted into the host cell cytosol after EHEC is phagocytized by macrophages, leading to decreased levels of intracellular ROS and facilitating EHEC's intramacrophage survival. The deletion mutant of T6SS was attenuated in virulence compared to the wild type strain, while the deletion mutant of katN had comparable virulence. These findings suggest that EHEC can sense oxidative stress in the phagosome and decrease the host cell ROS by secreting catalase KatN to facilitate its survival in the host cells.
 Candida auris is a multi-drug resistant, health care-associated fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections. It is unique among Candida species due to its ability to adhere to and colonize the skin or persist in an environment outside the host. In this study, researchers identified the presence of Als3-like adhesins in C. auris, making it a potential target for immunotherapeutic strategies using NDV-3A, a vaccine with known efficacy against other Candida species and safety as well as efficacy in clinical trials. NDV-3A vaccination induced cross-reactive antibody and T cell responses against C. auris, and the sera from vaccinated mice blocked virulence characteristics of C. auris and enhanced opsonophagocytic killing. Furthermore, vaccination protected mice from lethal C. auris infection and improved the efficacy of sub-therapeutic doses of micafungin. The protection appears to be mediated by humoral and cellular immunity that leads to fungal clearance by tissue macrophages. These findings identify NDV-3A as a promising vaccine for adjunctive treatment of life-threatening bloodstream infections caused by the multidrug resistant C. auris.
 Androctonus australis hector (Aah) scorpion venom causes systemic inflammation in the adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance. The venom induces an increase in TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression, which in turn activates Map4k4 kinase and decreases Hexokinase 2 expression, blunting the insulin response in adipocytes. The findings suggest that Aah venom-induced adipose tissue inflammation contributes to insulin resistance, and the use of TNF-α inhibitors as a treatment complementary to anti-scorpion venom immunotherapy should be evaluated clinically.Introduction:Scorpion venoms induce systemic inflammation, which is associated with an increase in cytokine release and chemokine production. Androctonus australis hector (Aah) venom is the most common cause of serious human envenomation in Algeria, responsible for approximately 50,000 cases per year. The venom causes multi-system failure, including cardiopulmonary abnormalities, lung edema, and inflammation. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia have been reported in scorpion-envenomed animals. The mechanisms causing systemic and local inflammation are poorly understood.Study:To investigate the effects of Aah venom on adipose tissue inflammation (ATI) and insulin sensitivity, mice were injected with Aah venom, toxic fraction of Aah (FTox-G50), or saline solution as a control. Inflammatory responses were evaluated by ELISA and cell sorting analyses in adipose tissue 45 minutes and 24 hours after injection. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the regulation of genes implicated in glucose uptake. The titers of selected inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were also determined in sera and in insulin target tissues.Results:The serum concentration of IL-1β rose 45 minutes after envenomation and returned to basal level after 24 hours. The pathophysiological effects of the venom after 24 hours mainly involved M1-proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue combined with high titers of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. TNF-α was strongly induced in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Insulin induced a significant increase in the expression of the mRNAs for hexokinase 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in control mice; this upregulation was completely abolished after 24 hours in mice envenomed with Aah or FTox-G50.Conclusion:The findings suggest that Aah venom induces insulin resistance by mechanisms involving TNF-α-dependent Map4k4 kinase activation in the adipose tissue. The use of TNF-α inhibitors as a treatment complementary to anti-scorpion venom immunotherapy should be evaluated clinically.Keywords:medicine, biology, insulin resistance, adipose tissue inflammation, Androctonus australis hector, TNF-α, Map4k4 kinase, hexokinase 2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
 Influenza viruses, particularly the seasonal A (H1N1) and H3N2 strains, continue to pose a significant threat to public health. The emergence of new variants with distinct antigenic properties can cause varying degrees of morbidity and mortality. Accurately estimating the mortality burden of new influenza strains in a timely manner is crucial for effective response and prevention strategies. However, current methods rely mainly on intensive and unbiased influenza surveillance, which can be limited and prone to bias.In this study, a novel host-virus interaction model was proposed to establish a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by viral strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each type of seasonal influenza viruses. This relationship was used to develop a method for rapidly assessing the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between A (H1N1) strains.The findings from this study could help formulate cost-effective responses for influenza control and prevention by providing rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden for new seasonal strains.
 In the complex world of skin biology, epithelial stem cells operate within a niche that is influenced by various signaling pathways, including those of the immune system. While it is known that immune cells interact with epithelial stem cells, the specific role of immune cells in stem cell activation is not well understood. In a recent study, researchers investigated the relationship between skin-resident macrophages and skin epithelial stem cells during the murine hair cycle.The study found that before the onset of epithelial hair follicle stem cell activation, skin-resident macrophages undergo apoptosis, leading to a decrease in their number. This process is linked to distinct gene expression, including Wnt transcription. Interestingly, by mimicking this event through the selective induction of macrophage apoptosis in early telogen, the researchers identified a novel involvement of macrophages in stem cell activation in vivo. Furthermore, the macrophage-specific pharmacological inhibition of Wnt production delayed hair follicle growth, suggesting that perifollicular macrophages contribute to the activation of skin epithelial stem cells as a novel, additional cue that regulates their regenerative activity.These findings may have significant implications for skin repair, inflammatory skin diseases, and cancer. By understanding the role of immune cells in stem cell activation, researchers may be able to develop new therapeutic strategies for promoting wound healing and treating skin disorders. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay between different cell types in the skin niche when studying skin biology and developing new treatments.
 Schistosomiasis is a major public health issue affecting millions of people worldwide. While current treatments, such as praziquantel, are effective, they have limitations, including their inability to prevent reinfection and the potential for drug resistance. To address these challenges, a transmission-blocking vaccine for schistosomes is being explored as a complementary strategy. Schistosoma japonicum, a major parasite responsible for zoonotic schistosomiasis in China and the Philippines, has two types of insulin receptors (SjIR1 and SjIR2) that are highly expressed in adult worms and play important roles in glucose metabolism and fecundity. In this study, we investigated the functions of SjIR1 and SjIR2 in adult S. japonicum using protein interaction assays and RNA interference (RNAi). We found that human insulin can bind the L1 subdomain (insulin binding domain) of recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2, and RNAi knockdown of SjIRs resulted in reduced transcription of downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake in SjIR-knockdown worms compared to luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, we found that recombinant SjLD1 and SjLD2 (the L1 subdomains of SjIR1 and SjIR2) depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These findings re-emphasize the potential of SjIRs as veterinary transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica.
 Primate lentiviruses, such as HIV-1 and SIV, rely on the protein Nef for sustained replication in vivo and accelerated progression to AIDS. While the mechanism by which Nef increases the infectivity of cell-free virions is not well understood, recent studies have explored a potential functional link between Nef and Env. Nef was found to confer resistance to certain neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that target the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of TMgp41 in HIV-1, with as much as 50-fold resistance observed for 2F5 and 4E10. This resistance was observed across a range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. This activity requires Nef myristoylation but is genetically separable from other Nef functions. Glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV substituted for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. The data suggests that Nef alters MPER recognition in the context of the virion membrane, as Nef and Glycosylated-Gag decreased the efficiency of virion capture by 2F5 and 4E10, but not by other nAbs. These findings demonstrate that Nef protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies, with important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
 In response to oxygen depletion, denitrifying bacteria produce a set of enzymes to convert nitrate and nitrite to nitrogen gas (denitrification). This process is crucial for generating energy during anoxia and plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle with far-reaching consequences, including contributions to global warming and destruction of stratospheric ozone. Recent studies suggest that only a marginal fraction of Paracoccus denitrificans, a model denitrifying bacterium, is able to switch to denitrification when oxygen levels decrease. To explain this phenomenon, a dynamic model was constructed to investigate the hypothesis that the low success rate is due to a low probability for cells to initiate the transcription of genes (nirS) encoding a key denitrification enzyme (NirS) and a limited time-window in which NirS must be produced. The simulation results showed that within the limited time available, a probability of 0.005 h−1 for each cell to initiate nirS transcription, resulting in the recruitment of 3.8-16.1% cells to denitrification, is sufficient to adequately simulate experimental data. This finding challenges conventional outlook on the regulation of denitrification and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the geographic distribution of denitrifying bacteria.
 In this study, researchers investigated how contextual bars influence the perception of a target bar in visual object recognition. Participants were asked to judge whether a target bar was present at the center of a display, given weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without a context of other bars. The results showed that observers are more likely to perceive a target when the context has a weaker rather than stronger contrast. When the context can perceptually group well with the target, weak contrast contextual bars bias observers to perceive a target relative to the condition without contexts. However, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of whether they group well with the target, bias observers to perceive no target.A Bayesian model of visual inference was used to account for the data, illustrating that the context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The data suggest that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences, as the context does not influence the perceived target contrast despite its influence on the bias to perceive the target's presence.
 Lectin-like bacteriotoxic proteins, found in certain plant-associated bacteria, can selectively kill closely related species, including phytopathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas. The crystal structure of LlpABW, the prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, reveals an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain adopts a fold similar to plant lectins and contains a mannose-binding site, while the N-terminal MMBL domain is structurally more divergent and lacks a functional mannose-binding site. The N-domain determines target specificity, suggesting that this bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity.
 The genomic GC-content of bacteria varies greatly, from less than 20% to over 70%. This variation is often attributed to differences in mutation patterns between bacteria. However, a recent study examining synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species found a large excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in all but the most AT-rich bacteria. This excess of GC→AT mutations cannot be explained by mutation bias, translational selection, or biased gene conversion. Instead, it suggests that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, this finding also implies that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
 Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that can survive in their human hosts for decades. Previously, it was shown that schistosomes possess stem cells, called neoblasts, which support tissue maintenance. However, it is unclear whether neoblasts have functions independent of tissue maintenance, such as in tissue regeneration following injury. In this study, researchers investigated the role of the schistosome CBP/p300 homolog, Sm-cbp1, in neoblast function and tissue repair.The researchers found that depleting Sm-cbp1 transcript levels using RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increased neoblast proliferation and cell death, eventually leading to organ degeneration. They speculated that this increased rate of neoblast proliferation may be a response to mitigate tissue damage due to increased cell death. To test this hypothesis, they investigated the effect of mechanical injury on neoblast proliferation. They found that mechanical injury induced both cell death and neoblast proliferation at wound sites, suggesting that schistosome neoblasts are capable of mounting proliferative responses to injury.Furthermore, they observed that the health of cbp1 (RNAi) parasites progressively declined during the course of their in vitro experiments. To determine the fate of cbp1 (RNAi) parasites in the context of a mammalian host, they coupled RNAi with an established technique to transplant schistosomes into the mesenteric veins of uninfected mice. They found that transplanted cbp1 (RNAi) parasites were cleared from the vasculature of recipient mice and were incapable of inducing measurable pathology in their recipient hosts.Together, these data suggest that injury is sufficient to induce neoblast proliferation and that cbp1 is essential for parasite survival in vivo. These studies present a new methodology to study schistosome gene function in vivo and highlight a potential role for schistosome neoblasts in promoting tissue repair following injury.
 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that disproportionately affect low-income populations, and research efforts to address them have increased in recent decades. However, significant need gaps in diagnostic and treatment tools remain. In this study, we aimed to identify and map NTD research networks in Germany and their partners abroad to evaluate German contributions to NTD research. We conducted a SCOPUS database search for articles with German author affiliations published between 2002 and 2012 for kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. We then used open-access tools for data cleaning, geocoding, and creating co-authorship networks to analyze collaborations and research institutions. Our findings revealed that of the 1,187 publications with at least one German author affiliation, 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions were identified. The majority of collaborations were with high-income countries and Brazil, while collaborations with partners on the African continent remained scattered. We identified strong performers using classic parameters and social network analysis parameters. The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases. The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research, highlighting the need to identify barriers and expand German research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators and can facilitate data-driven health policies. Our findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.
 Chagas disease, a major vector-borne parasitic disease in Latin America, is primarily transmitted to humans by triatomine vectors, with approximately 9.8 to 11 million infected people and 60 million at risk. While efforts to control domiciled vectors through insecticide spraying and housing improvement have been successful in reducing house infestations and Chagas disease transmission, non-domiciled vectors remain a significant challenge for disease control. These vectors, such as Triatoma dimidiata in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, occasionally infest domestic habitats through seasonal dispersal from peridomestic and sylvatic sites.To better understand the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciled vectors inside houses, a mathematical model was developed and used to fit and predict field data from the Yucatan peninsula. The model accurately predicted the seasonal pattern of transient house infestation by T. dimidiata, and simulations examined the efficacy of control strategies based on residual insecticide spraying, insect screens, and bednets.Pyrethroid spraying was found to be effective when applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season, resulting in an 80% reduction in bug abundance. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction, and the efficacy decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. In contrast, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate.Control of non-domiciled vectors cannot be effectively achieved by insecticide spraying due to the need for yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
 In this study, researchers investigated the role of two EBV regulatory proteins, BGLF4 and BGLF3, in controlling the expression of structural proteins necessary for EBV infection and pathogenesis. BGLF4 is a protein kinase conserved in all herpesviruses, and BGLF3 is a protein of unknown function with no cellular counterparts. The researchers found that the enzymatic activity of BGLF4 is required after replication of viral DNA to stimulate expression of structural proteins. BGLF3 and BGLF4 are expressed from the same locus in the genome, and they work in concert and independently to promote expression of viral genes encoding structural proteins. These findings provide novel insights into the control of expression of genes encoding viral structural proteins and suggest that the enzymatic activity of BGLF4 is a potential target for development of new antiviral drugs.
 In this study, researchers investigated the role of a novel effector protein, KatN, in the intracellular survival and virulence of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in mice. KatN is a Mn-catalase identified as a T6SS effector that inhibits host cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) to help EHEC evade host immune killing. The researchers found that KatN is conserved among different T. cruzi lineages and has orthologs in other Trypanosoma species. They also demonstrated that TcSMP proteins, which were previously identified in T. cruzi membrane-enriched fractions, are capable of inhibiting metacyclic trypomastigote entry into host cells and triggering Ca2+ signaling and lysosome exocytosis, events required for parasitophorous vacuole biogenesis. The effects of TcSMP were of lower magnitude compared to gp82, the major adhesion protein of metacyclic trypomastigotes, suggesting that TcSMP may play an auxiliary role in host cell invasion. Overall, the findings suggest that T. cruzi may rely on diverse adhesion molecules to effectively infect mammalian hosts, and that the productive interaction of T. cruzi with host cells may depend on multiple surface molecules working together.
 In this study, researchers analyzed the genomes of 20 individuals to evaluate the prospects for identifying rare functional variants that contribute to a phenotype of interest. They sequenced ten "case" genomes from individuals with severe hemophilia A and ten "control" genomes. The analysis revealed that each genome carries an average of 165 homozygous protein-truncating or stop loss variants in genes representing a diverse set of pathways. The researchers also found that the number of novel single nucleotide variants (SNVs) discovered per genome seems to stabilize at about 144,000 new variants per genome after the first 15 individuals have been sequenced. The study provides a proof of concept for the identification of rare and highly-penetrant functional variants by confirming that the cause of hemophilia A is easily recognizable in this data set. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the human genome and the genetic basis of diseases.
 HIV infection is linked to high rates of osteopenia and osteoporosis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our recent research in rats with the HIV transgenic model revealed that bone loss was associated with increased B cell expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor-activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), while OPG expression was decreased. To translate these findings to humans, we conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV-uninfected and antiretroviral therapy-naïve HIV-infected individuals. We found that HIV-infected individuals had higher bone resorption and osteopenia, with increased B cell expression of RANKL and decreased expression of OPG. The B cell RANKL/OPG ratio correlated significantly with total hip and femoral neck bone mineral density in HIV-infected subjects. Our findings suggest that HIV-induced bone loss may be driven in part by the disruption of the immuno-skeletal interface, specifically B cell dysfunction.
 In this study, researchers investigated the molecular responses of schistosomes, the parasitic worms that cause schistosomiasis, to the drug praziquantel. They used a transcriptional and functional approach to define the molecular responses of Schistosoma japonicum to praziquantel by analyzing gene expression in adult worms isolated from infected mice after 0.5 to 24 hours after oral administration of sub-lethal doses of the drug. The results showed that male parasites initially up-regulated genes associated with surface integrity, muscle function, ion regulation, and drug resistance. Female worms, on the other hand, up-regulated genes associated with calcium regulation, drug resistance, detoxification, and pathogen defense. A subset of highly over-expressed genes was validated by qPCR, and the leading candidate among these was CamKII, a putative calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II. RNA interference was used to knockdown CamKII in S. japonicum to determine its role in the response to praziquantel. The findings suggest that CamKII mitigates the effects of praziquantel by stabilizing Ca2+ fluxes within parasite muscles and tegument. Overall, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of praziquantel's mode of action against schistosomes.
 Histone chaperones CAF-1 and Asf1 play crucial roles in depositing newly synthesized histones onto replicating DNA to promote nucleosome formation during DNA replication and DNA repair. The Elongator complex, which includes the catalytic subunit Elp3, is involved in this process by acetylating histones H3 and H4. Elp3 interacts with the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), and cells lacking Elp3 exhibit growth defects and increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In this study, we report an interaction between Elp3 and PCNA, and we demonstrate that Elp3 is required for S-phase progression in the presence of DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). Our findings suggest that the Elongator complex plays a novel role in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability through a pathway linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA.
 Vaccines are an essential tool in protecting against infectious diseases, but determining the optimal inoculum dose, or the amount of antigen used, is crucial. Higher doses can lead to better immune responses, but may also cause more severe side effects and limit population coverage in the event of vaccine shortages. In this study, researchers used mathematical models and experimental data from influenza A virus (IAV) and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection in mice and cotton rats, respectively, to map inoculum doses to immune protection and morbidity levels. They found that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can vary depending on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. This framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal inoculum dose.
 Mycobacterium africanum, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), is responsible for up to half of all tuberculosis cases in West Africa. Two lineages of M. africanum, lineages 5 and 6, have been identified within the MTC and are primarily found in West Africa. The reasons for the geographic restriction of these lineages are not well understood, but hypotheses include a unique animal reservoir, a preference for West African ethnicities, or an inability to compete with other lineages outside of West Africa.To better understand the genetics of lineages 5 and 6, we sequenced 92 clinical MTC isolates from Mali, including 26 lineage 5 and 24 lineage 6 strains. Our analysis revealed that these lineages do not constitute a distinct species within the MTC, but rather share similar levels of diversity and evolve drug resistance through similar mechanisms as other MTC lineages. We also identified a putative novel streptomycin resistance mutation and evidence of person-to-person transmission of lineage 6 isolates.Our findings suggest that lineages 5 and 6 are not geographically restricted due to an inability to transmit between West African hosts or to an elevated number of mutations in virulence-associated genes. However, lineage-specific mutations, such as mutations in cell wall structure, secretion systems, and cofactor biosynthesis, may contribute to host specificity.Overall, this is the largest collection of lineage 5 and 6 whole genome sequences to date, and our data provide valuable insights into the genetics of these lineages and potential mechanisms that may explain their geographic distribution. Further studies are needed to fully characterize the genetics of lineages 5 and 6 and to understand the factors contributing to their geographic restriction.
 Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species, which can lead to a range of symptoms from mild to severe, including jaundice, kidney and liver dysfunction, and widespread endothelial damage. The ability of Leptospira to bind to host tissue components is crucial for infection and pathogenesis. While it is known that extracellular matrix (ECM) components play a role in the interaction of the pathogen with host molecules, recent research suggests that pathogenic Leptospira binds more efficiently to host cells than to ECM components.To identify the bacterial adhesins involved in this interaction, researchers used in vitro phage display to select for phage clones that bind to endothelial cells. They identified four candidate adhesins: LIC10508, LIC11574, LIC12341, and LIC13411. Recombinant LIC11574 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both endothelial and epithelial cells and bound to VE-cadherin, an endothelial cell receptor for L. interrogans. These findings may be valuable in leptospirosis control and prevention, as the bacterial adhesins could potentially serve as targets for the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
 Inhibitory neurons play crucial roles in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in various brain systems. Two common inhibitory network motifs are feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB). In the locust, it was proposed that lateral horn interneurons (LHNs) provide feed-forward inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing, which is essential for olfactory learning and memory. However, recent studies revealed that a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), is the primary source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and that inhibition from this cell is mediated by a feedback loop including KCs and the GGN. To better understand the differences between FF and FB inhibition in circuit dynamics, a model of the locust olfactory system was developed. The study found that both inhibitory motifs could maintain sparse KCs responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with in vivo data. These findings suggest that the GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs. A better understanding of how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.
 The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project aimed at aggregating BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support collaborative research activities. Its goal is to generate an informed and current understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across these iconic cancer predisposition genes. The project began by integrating reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases into a single site, www.brcaexchange.org. The purpose of the BRCA Exchange is to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number found in the next-largest public database, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases, as well as population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together the existing international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium expert panel, along with expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, all with a common goal of advancing our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data to encourage data sharing, development of methods suitable for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The BRCA Exchange allows for rapid and simple classification of Leishmania isolates to the species complex level, consistent with reference methods, which could be useful to guide treatment decision in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.
 We present a new method to infer demographic parameters from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of large genomic datasets using a flexible and robust simulation-based framework. Our approach allows for the study of evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which cannot be handled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple scenarios, our method compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed with the current reference method, while showing better convergence properties for complex models. We apply our methodology to non-coding genomic SNP data from four human populations and infer their demographic history by comparing neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity, including unsampled populations. We also extend our framework to infer demographic parameters from SNP chips with known ascertainment bias, such as that recently released by Affymetrix to study human origins. Our method can correctly infer parameters of more complex models, including the divergence of several populations, bottlenecks, and migration, while previous ways of handling ascertained SNPs were either restricted to a single population or only allowed the inference of divergence time between a pair of populations. Our methodology appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large genomic data sets.
 In the field of infectious disease outbreaks, reconstructing transmission trees from densely sampled whole genome sequence data has become an essential tool for understanding transmission dynamics. However, a fundamental limitation of such approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. This study introduces the concept of 'transmission divergence' as a measure of the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. Using literature-derived parameters, the authors simulate outbreak scenarios for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens and find that transmission divergence is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. This low transmission divergence limits the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using genetic data alone and highlights the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data. The results demonstrate that genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens, such as RNA viruses, can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, while sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events.
 Mycobacterium africanum, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), causes up to half of all tuberculosis cases in West Africa but is rarely found outside of this region. The reasons for this geographical restriction are unknown, but possible explanations include a geographically restricted animal reservoir, a unique preference for hosts of West African ethnicity, or an inability to compete with other lineages outside of West Africa. To better understand the genetics of lineages 5 and 6 and their geographic distribution, researchers sequenced 92 MTC clinical isolates from Mali, including two lineage 5 and 24 lineage 6 strains. Their analysis revealed that lineages 5 and 6 do not constitute a distinct species within the MTC and that drug resistance evolves through similar mechanisms in Mali. However, lineage-specific mutations, such as mutations in cell wall structure, secretion systems, and cofactor biosynthesis, may contribute to host specificity. This is the largest collection of lineage 6 strains sequenced to date and the first in-depth whole genomic characterization of lineage 5.
