 Neural networks in the brain are essential for complex cognitive functions, but it is unclear how immature neural networks develop into their mature form needed for these functions. Researchers investigated the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns in developing mice using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology. They found that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. Similar developmental trajectories were observed in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. The researchers hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. During this developmental epoch, cortical microcircuits are still undergoing changes in anatomical and functional connectivity, and inhibitory network influences of interneurons increase. These local circuit changes are paralleled by the gradual ingrowth of subcortical neurotransmitters that assist in setting brain state changes. Together, these modifications could prime a shift in network operating mode, setting the stage for re-emergence of a different oscillation that occupies a similar frequency band, thalamocortical sleep spindles. In contrast to immature spindle bursts, these oscillations are characteristic of the offline state of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep only, and they facilitate memory consolidation. Understanding when and how these properties develop in the immature brain is critical for the development of interventions to prevent or mitigate impaired cognition.
 Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that affects brain development and function, and its causes are not fully understood. One gene that has been linked to schizophrenia is neuregulin 1 (NRG1), which encodes a signaling protein with multiple isoforms. One of these isoforms, type III NRG1, is membrane-bound and can signal intracellularly. The intracellular part of NRG1, Nrg1-ICD, is released by intramembrane cleavage by γ-secretase. However, it is unclear which specific γ-secretase is involved in this cleavage.In this study, researchers used genetic techniques to remove a specific part of the γ-secretase enzyme in the brains of mice and found that the brain cells of these mutant mice contained fewer dendritic spines than mice with normal γ-secretases. However, the number of dendritic spines in the mutant mice could be restored by introducing γ-secretase. These results suggest that mutations that remove the ability of γ-secretases to cleave NRG1 may contribute to some of the structural and functional changes in the brain that are associated with schizophrenia.Furthermore, the researchers identified a positive feedback loop in which TGF-β signaling promotes the expression of Rbfox2 in NCCs. This finding may be relevant in human disease studies, given that altered TGF-β signaling is a common feature in many birth defects seen in humans. Overall, this study provides important insights into the role of γ-secretases in NRG1 processing and the potential aetiological role of misprocessing of NRG1 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
 A recent study published in the journal "Neuron" explored the relationship between functional connectivity in the brain and smoking and drinking behaviors. The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from two large datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the IMAGEN collaboration, to examine whole-brain functional connectivity in groups of people using nicotine, alcohol, or both.The researchers found that smokers had a lower overall functional connectivity between brain regions compared to non-smokers. Specifically, smokers had weaker connections involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, which are regions associated with non-reward mechanisms. These differences may make smokers more impulsive and less able to resist smoking.On the other hand, people who drank a high amount of alcohol had increased overall functional connectivity, with specific increases in reward-related systems including the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the cingulate cortex. These differences may make drinkers more sensitive to the rewarding aspects of alcohol or more impulsive.The study also found that increased impulsivity was associated with decreased functional connectivity of the non-reward-related lateral orbitofrontal cortex in smokers, and increased impulsivity was associated with increased functional connectivity of the reward-related medial orbitofrontal cortex in high amount drinkers.These findings were cross-validated in an independent longitudinal dataset, suggesting that these differences in brain connectivity play a role in smoking and drinking behaviors. The study also found that the functional connectivities in 14-year-old non-smokers and female low-drinkers were related to who would smoke or drink at age 19, providing further evidence for the importance of these differences.Overall, this study provides important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying smoking and drinking behaviors, and highlights the potential role of functional connectivity differences in the development and maintenance of these behaviors.
 In the field of neuroscience, researchers have long studied how the brain learns and adapts to new information. Traditionally, it was believed that learning was driven solely by external feedback, such as rewards or punishments. However, recent studies suggest that internal feedback processes may also play a role in learning, particularly in instances where no external feedback is present.Guggenmos et al. investigated this hypothesis in the context of perceptual learning using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and confidence reports as a measure of internal monitoring processes. They found that mesolimbic brain areas, including the ventral striatum and ventral tegmental area, encoded both anticipation and prediction error of confidence, similar to previous findings for external reward-based feedback.The researchers developed a novel computational model in which learning is guided by confidence-based reinforcement signals. They found that confidence prediction errors, which act as a teaching signal in the model, serve as the basis for strengthening neural circuitry associated with high-confidence percepts and weakening circuitry associated with low-confidence percepts. The strength of these mesolimbic confidence signals was linked to individual learning success.These findings provide a mechanistic neurobiological explanation for learning without external feedback by augmenting reinforcement models with confidence-based feedback. The results demonstrate that internal feedback processes can play a crucial role in learning and that confidence reports can serve as a window into these processes. Future studies could investigate whether similar self-generated feedback applies in non-perceptual forms of learning.
 A recent study published in the journal Nature Genetics aimed to characterize the genetic diversity and gene-flow in a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups. The researchers used a genome-wide, haplotype-based analysis to understand the historical connections between different population groups due to admixture.The study revealed that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years.The findings provide insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, which is relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the genetic basis of diseases in Africa, as progress has been slower compared to populations of European descent.The researchers used a genome-wide analysis to identify recent Eurasian admixture in the Fulani of West Africa and several East African groups, as well as ancient Eurasian admixture in the Yoruba of Central West Africa. Comparisons of contemporary sub-Saharan African populations with the first ancient genome from within Africa provide additional support for limited migration of Eurasian ancestry back into East Africa within the last 3000 years.The study also found evidence of widespread hunter-gatherer ancestry in African populations, including ancient Khoesan ancestry in the Igbo from Nigeria and more recent hunter-gatherer ancestry in eastern and southern African populations. The identification of hunter-gatherer ancestry in non-hunter-gatherer populations together with the timing of these events is consistent with the known expansion of Bantu languages across Africa within the last 3000 years.Overall, the study provides an important description of the movement of alleles and haplotypes into and within the continent, but questions remain regarding the extent and timing of key events and their impact on contemporary populations.
 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common human tumor virus that can cause various types of cancer. EBV expresses several oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis, with the viral protein LMP1 being a key player in this process. However, during early infection, EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. To understand how early-infected B cells survive, researchers used a technique called BH3 profiling to investigate mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis. They identified a transition from uninfected B cells to early-infected cells and immortalized cells, which is unique to virus-infected cells. This transition relies on the viral EBNA3A protein's regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription. This study sheds new light on EBNA3A's role in suppressing apoptosis and has implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.
 The inferior colliculus, a major hearing center in the mammalian brain, is crucial for recognizing speech and pinpointing the location of sounds. However, little is known about the specific properties of neurons within this region, particularly in terms of defining distinct classes and understanding the precise nature of their connections. In a recent study, researchers identified vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons as a novel class of principal neurons in the inferior colliculus of mice. These neurons are glutamatergic stellate cells with sustained firing patterns and extensive axons that project to long-range targets, including the auditory thalamus, auditory brainstem, superior colliculus, and periaqueductal gray. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, the researchers found that VIP neurons integrate input from the contralateral IC and the dorsal cochlear nucleus, and that input from the auditory brainstem also drove local, feedforward inhibition onto VIP neurons. This reveals a novel circuit motif that may control the temporal summation of ascending input to the IC, providing a critical step toward determining how defined neural circuits in the IC support sound processing.
 Exercise has been shown to reduce tumor growth in animals and improve outcomes for cancer patients in humans. The mechanisms behind this protective effect are not well understood, but recent research suggests that exercise may enhance the function of cytotoxic T cells, which play a crucial role in controlling tumor growth by identifying and eliminating malignant cells. In this study, Rundqvist et al. investigated how exercise affects cytotoxic T cells and the metabolites released in response to exercise that may alter their function.The researchers found that exercise itself can modify cytotoxic T cell metabolism, and that exercise-induced effects on tumor growth are dependent on cytotoxic T cell activity. They also discovered that CDK9, a kinase that facilitates Pol II pause release, stimulates release of paused polymerases and activates transcription by increasing the number of transcribing polymerases and thus the amount of mRNA synthesized per time. This study provides important insights into how exercise may enhance the immune response against tumors and could have implications for the development of new cancer therapies.
 Chromosome segregation during meiosis is a complex process that requires the coordination of multiple forces and regulatory mechanisms. In mammalian oocytes, a protein called Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) plays an essential role in this process by protecting cohesin, turning off the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), promoting chromosome congression and bi-orientation, and limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, while its effects on the SAC, chromosome congression, and bi-orientation are independent of PP2A. Sgol2 achieves these functions by recruiting MCAK to limit bivalent stretching and inhibiting Aurora C kinase activity to promote K-fiber formation. By linking these diverse processes, Sgol2 ensures accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis.
 The primary cilium is a hair-like structure that extends from the surface of many types of cells, playing a role in sensing and signaling. Defects in the primary cilium can lead to various human diseases, collectively known as ciliopathies. The length and stability of primary cilia are regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and its co-activator Cdc20. APC-Cdc20 is localized to the basal body of primary cilia, where it negatively controls the length and stability of axonemal microtubules. During cell exit from the quiescent state, APC-Cdc20 is activated and drives ciliary resorption. Additionally, APC-Cdc20 regulates the stability of axonemal microtubules through targeting Nek1, the ciliary kinase, for proteolysis. These findings demonstrate a novel function of APC beyond cell cycle control and highlight the importance of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in ciliary disassembly.
 C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has evolved independently in over 60 plant lineages, but the evolutionary pathways leading to this trait are not well understood. In a new study, researchers used a combination of data analysis and modeling to explore the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and identified four major trajectories.The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3-C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. They then developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model to predict how the C4 phenotype evolved.The results showed that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. The order of C4 trait acquisition was also flexible, which will have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait.Understanding the evolutionary events that have generated C4 photosynthesis on many independent occasions has the potential to inform approaches being undertaken to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species. C4 photosynthesis is important because it increases the efficiency of photosynthesis in the sub-tropics and tropics, making it the most productive crops and native vegetation on the planet.The study provides new insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and highlights the importance of considering evolutionary paths as stochastic processes on complex adaptive landscapes.
 Influenza A viruses (IAV) are known to shut off host gene expression to ensure priority access to the translation machinery for their own replication. However, the mechanisms behind this host shutoff are not well understood. In a recent study, researchers used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the strategies used by IAV to induce host shutoff.The results showed that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, but instead, the decline in cellular protein synthesis is due to viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Interestingly, short transcripts are less affected by IAV, and these refractory mRNAs are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation.These findings advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions. The study also reveals strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, which could be useful in understanding the specific mechanisms of host shutoff in different contexts. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between viruses and host cells during infection.
 In the ocean, microscopic algae called phytoplankton play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into organic matter through photosynthesis. During spring, these algae bloom in large numbers, leading to a surge in primary production. However, not all of this organic matter is used by the algae or consumed by larger organisms. Instead, a significant portion is consumed by bacteria that feed on the dead or dying algae.These bacteria, which include members of the Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Roseobacter clade, play a critical role in the carbon cycle by breaking down the organic matter and releasing carbon dioxide back into the water. The process by which these bacteria remineralize algal biomass is of global importance, as it impacts the amount of carbon that is cycled back into the atmosphere.Recent studies have shown that the succession of bacterial clades during phytoplankton blooms is not random but rather governed by deterministic principles. During spring blooms in the southern North Sea, researchers detected recurring patterns of bacterial clades down to the genus level, as well as recurrent patterns at the functional level with respect to algal polysaccharide degradation genes.These findings suggest that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is largely governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing. Understanding the mechanisms behind these patterns can help us better predict the impact of phytoplankton blooms on the carbon cycle and the role of bacteria in shaping microbial communities in the ocean.
 Coiled coils are well-studied protein structures, with their backbone structure able to be described by parametric equations. However, recent research has revealed an unexpected formation of a new type of fiber through the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the formation of short β-strands and an α/β coiled coil. This new structure retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil, demonstrating that substantially novel backbone structures are possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.
 Hemoglobin (Hb), a protein responsible for tissue oxygen delivery, has long been studied for its adaptive properties. While it was believed that only the affinity of oxygen binding to Hb determines molecular adaptations, recent research suggests that both affinity and cooperativity play important roles. The authors of this study propose that Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimize tissue oxygen delivery.To test this hypothesis, the authors derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the 'biophysical Hill landscape' describing this relation. They found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape, allowing for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen.These findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb and have implications for understanding the adaptive behavior of other proteins. The 'biophysical Hill landscape'-mapping strategy used in this study offers a mechanistic-level understanding of how physiological and evolutionary variations operate to shape the molecular properties of proteins.
 A recent study published in the journal eLife has revealed the existence of a functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. This valve complex, which is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals, allows females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections.The females of Neotrogla have a penis-like intromittent organ, which is inserted into a male's vagina-like genital cavity for copulation. During mating, the male injects liquid semen into the female's sperm storage organ, the spermatheca, through the opening of the female penis. The semen then forms a hard capsule around itself within the spermatheca. Although there is only a single inlet spermathecal duct present, occasionally two seminal capsules are attached simultaneously to a plate-like structure on the spermatheca, which is termed the 'spermathecal plate'.The semen within the capsule is used not only for fertilization but is also consumed by the female as nutrition. To compete for nutritious semen, the direction of sexual selection is reversed in Neotrogla, and each seminal capsule is voluminous and the duration of copulation is very long. The female penis of Neotrogla bears a lot of spines, which females use to anchor a male coercively during copulation.After consumption of the semen, the empty capsule is detached from the plate, which is kept within the spermatheca. Females frequently have empty capsules within the spermathecal pouch, and the empty capsules are detached and replaced with new ones. This allows females to be considered polyandrous, which is apparently controlled actively by the female.The spermathecal plate, which is kept within the spermatheca, is a novelty tightly associated with the seminal gifting in Neotrogla. However, the detailed morphology and function of this plate remained unclear due to the extremely small size of the involved subcomponents and their fragile spatial composition. In this study, the researchers used a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy and high-resolution synchrotron microcomputed tomography to assess the functional morphology of sperm storage and control of seminal flow in the spermathecal plate of three species of Neotrogla.Based on the results, the researchers discuss the evolutionary significance of this plate during the evolution of the reversed intromittent organs in Neotrogla. The study provides new insights into the morphology and function of this fascinating biological structure, which is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats.
 The Golgi complex is a crucial compartment in eukaryotic cells that sorts and packages proteins and lipids for transport to various destinations. Sec7, a regulatory protein at the Golgi complex, plays a key role in controlling outgoing vesicles. The protein has multiple domains, including the DCB and HUS domains, which have been proposed to have various functions but their exact roles remain unclear.Through X-ray crystallography, Richardson et al. have determined the three-dimensional structure of the regulatory DCB and HUS domains of Sec7 from a species of yeast. Surprisingly, they found that these domains form a single continuous structural unit, rather than being separate as previously thought.The DCB/HUS domain helps Sec7 function on the surface of membranes by enhancing the activation of Arf1, a regulatory protein involved in vesicle formation. This enhancement is dependent on both lipids and the N-terminal membrane insertion element of Arf1, suggesting a role in chaperoning the insertion of Arf1 into the Golgi membrane.Understanding the structure and function of the DCB/HUS domain will help researchers unravel the complex mechanisms of protein trafficking and membrane biogenesis at the Golgi complex.
 Histones are proteins that help organize and compact DNA in the nucleus of a cell. In the fruit fly Drosophila, there is a complex called DOMINO that is responsible for both adding a specific histone variant called H2A.V (similar to H2A.Z in humans) and acetylating histones. Until now, it was thought that DOMINO was a single complex with both functions. However, new research shows that DOMINO actually consists of two distinct complexes, DOM-A and DOM-B, each with unique functions.DOM-B is responsible for depositing H2A.V genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. DOM-A, on the other hand, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex. This discovery provides an interesting example of how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separations.In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. In Drosophila, however, the same diversity is achieved through alternative splicing of a single gene. This finding raises questions about whether other small proteins can destabilize cell membranes in a similar manner to defensins and whether the immune systems of other organisms also recognize molecules from microbial cell membranes to trigger this kind of counterattack. Additionally, since defensins can also kill tumor cells, a better understanding of how they work might also lead to new treatments for cancer and other diseases in humans.
 In the field of developmental biology, the first two lineages to segregate during mammalian development are the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (TE). The ICM forms the embryo and gives rise to all germ layers, while the TE forms the extraembryonic tissue, giving rise to the placenta. During the blastocyst stage, the TE forms a monolayer epithelium surrounding the ICM, and inside and outside cell populations first form. During the 8 to 16 cell divisions, cells inherit varying amounts of apically localized proteins, leading to differences in polarity and the formation of distinct cell fates.Polarity differences result in differential activation of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is a key driver of ICM-TE lineage segregation. However, the exact timing of when differential Hippo signaling is instructive to establish cell fate is not known. Previous studies attempting to define this timing by isolating inside and outside cells at different stages and assessing cell potential in chimeras or re-aggregated embryos yielded conflicting results.To address these questions, Posfai et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the temporal dynamics of gene expression during lineage segregation and identify known and novel markers of the process. They found that the inner cell mass and trophectoderm lineages develop at different times, with the inner cell mass adopting its identity before committing to remaining in this lineage, revealing a window of time where different signals could still change the fate of the cells. However, when the early trophectoderm cells show the first signs of specialization, they also commit to their new identity at the same time.These findings suggest that the different timings at which these cell lineages form might provide embryos with the means to organize their own cells. However, it is important to understand exactly how cells commit to their fate, and future challenges include investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying this process.
 Recent studies have suggested that magnetic fields play a role in biological systems, with claims of a protein complex acting like a compass needle for magnetic orientation in animals and magnetic control of membrane conductance. However, these findings conflict with basic laws of physics, as the reported phenomena involve large discrepancies, from 5 to 10 log units. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. In this analysis, we argue that these claims require alternative explanations if they are to be valid. The physical laws governing magnetic fields and matter impose constraints on plausible biological mechanisms for both magnetosensation and magnetogenetics. These arguments should help in evaluating future hypotheses and in engineering new molecular tools.
 In a recent study, researchers investigated the neural basis for the strategy used by individuals with congenital amusia, a condition characterized by lifelong impairments in pitch processing. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), individuals with amusia and controls read sentences with comma-indicated grammatical phrase boundaries and then heard two sentences that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues, selecting the best match for the written sentence. The results revealed prominent reductions in functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions in the amusia group, reflecting the between-group differences in cue weights. These connectivity differences were not present during a control task. The findings suggest a compensatory mechanism for the reliability of perceptual dimensions and indicate that the neural basis for perceptual weighting in speech has yet to be investigated in atypical individuals.
 A recent study has identified a new player in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I pathway, a protein called TAPBPR, which functions as a peptide editor, working alongside the previously known peptide editor tapasin. TAPBPR binds to MHC class I in a peptide-receptive state and enhances peptide optimization, ensuring that MHC class I molecules are loaded with high-affinity peptides. The study reveals that TAPBPR catalyzes the dissociation of peptides from MHC class I complexes, enhances the loading of peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, and discriminates between peptides based on affinity in vitro. In cells, the depletion of TAPBPR increases the diversity of peptides presented on MHC I molecules, suggesting that TAPBPR is involved in restricting peptide presentation. The findings suggest that TAPBPR and tapasin are intimately involved in controlling peptide presentation to the immune system, with tapasin enhancing the rate and extent of MHC class I peptide loading and improving discrimination between peptides, while TAPBPR acts as a quality control checkpoint, closely monitoring and ensuring that the loaded peptide is stable within the MHC class I molecule.
 Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause foodborne illnesses and, in some cases, invasive infections. To survive, Listeria must evade the host's immune system and replicate in various cell types. In response to Listeria infection, the host cell activates an innate immune response, which includes the production of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). ISG15 is a linear di-ubiquitin-like protein that can modify other proteins and act as a cytokine.Previous studies have shown that ISG15 production is induced by type I interferon, but recent research suggests that its expression can also be independent of this interferon. In nonphagocytic cells, ISG15 expression is induced by the cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP), which detects bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. Importantly, ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo.To understand how ISG15 restricts Listeria infection, researchers used stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC) to identify ISGylated proteins. They found that infection or overexpression of ISG15 leads to ISGylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, which correlates with increased secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection.These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized role for ISG15 in the innate immune response to Listeria infection, highlighting its importance as a key component of the host defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens.
 In the complex process of protein production in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome. The Hrd1 protein plays a crucial role in this process by forming a channel that retrotranslocates misfolded proteins and associates with three other membrane proteins, Hrd3, Usa1, and Der1. Hrd1 undergoes autoubiquitination to activate the channel, but how it escapes degradation by the proteasome and returns to its inactive ground state is unknown.Recent research has shed light on this question by identifying Ubp1 as a membrane-bound deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that reverses the polyubiquitin modification of Hrd1, allowing it to escape uncontrolled degradation. The Hrd1 partner Hrd3 serves as a brake for autoubiquitination, while the UBL domain of Usa1 attenuates Ubp1’s activity, allowing Hrd1 autoubiquitination and activation. This delicate balance allows Hrd1 to undergo cycles of autoubiquitination and deubiquitination during ERAD.Understanding the regulation of Hrd1 is important because ERAD is a common quality control system for proteins, present in many different species, and dysfunction in ERAD can lead to various diseases. By studying the mechanisms of Hrd1 regulation in yeast, we may gain insights into how human cells deal with damaged proteins.
