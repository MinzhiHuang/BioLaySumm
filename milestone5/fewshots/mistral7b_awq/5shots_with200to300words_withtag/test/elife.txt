Acylation, a process of adding an acetyl group to various carbohydrates, is a widespread phenomenon in all forms of life. The proteins responsible for this process, known as acyltransferases with an AT3 domain, have been linked to various important functions in bacteria, including symbiosis, resistance to viruses and antimicrobials, and the biosynthesis of antibiotics. However, the structure and mechanism of these proteins are largely unknown. In this study, researchers used computational methods to build a model of a bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB, and discovered a novel fold for the AT3 domain. The resulting structure exhibited a large cytoplasmic cavity lined by essential residues for function. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the acyl-coA donor spans the membrane through a pore created by movement of an important loop, enabling OafB to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface. Limited interactions with the fused SGNH domain in OafB were identified, and modeling suggested this domain is mobile and can both accept acyl-groups from the AT3 and then reach beyond the membrane to reach acceptor substrates. This new model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could abrogate critical functions of bacterial pathogens.
Honey bees are skilled decision-makers when it comes to choosing which flowers to visit for nectar or pollen. To understand the mechanisms behind their quick and accurate decisions, researchers studied their behavior in a controlled environment. They found that honey bees' decisions were influenced by both the quality and reliability of evidence, with acceptance responses being more accurate and faster than rejection responses. The team also developed a novel model of decision-making that can be linked to known neural pathways in the insect brain and could have applications in robotics.The researchers used a controlled flight arena to test the honey bees' decision-making abilities, varying the likelihood of a stimulus offering reward or punishment and the quality of evidence for the stimuli. They found that honey bee decision-making was as sophisticated as that reported for primates. The bees' decisions were sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence, and acceptance responses were more accurate and faster than rejection responses. Fast acceptance responses were also more likely to be correct than slower ones, a phenomenon also seen in primates.To investigate the minimal circuitry required for these decision-making capacities, the team developed a model of decision-making. The model proposes a system for robust autonomous decision-making and can be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain. The findings from this study could help scientists better understand the neural mechanisms underlying honey bee foraging decisions and have potential applications in robotics.Introduction:Decision-making is a crucial aspect of cognition, and animals make decisions based on various factors such as what they can sense about their environment, their past experiences, context, and their current state. Honey bees, for example, must decide which flowers to visit for nectar and pollen. In this study, researchers investigated honey bee foraging decisions in controlled conditions to understand their decision-making capacities. They applied signal detection theory to understand the processes of signal discrimination, which is essential for making decisions.Signal detection theory is a framework for evaluating animals' decision-making capacity. It provides an abstract model and simple logic for how animals should respond given the signal they have received and their prior knowledge. In this study, the researchers assumed that a honey bee must choose between two possible actions - acceptance or rejection - after detecting a signal. They considered four possible outcomes: correct acceptance, correct rejection, incorrect acceptance, and incorrect rejection. The optimal decision is calculated by considering the expected payoffs of all four outcomes together. Both errors are integral parts of the decision-making process, and in an ecological context, they typically differ in costs to an animal.Decision-making processes are most often modeled with sequential sampling models, which are built on the assumption that sensory information on available options is noisy but evidence for different options accumulates over time through sequential sampling. A decision is made when the cumulant reaches a threshold. Variations in sequential sampling models differ in the nature of the threshold for the decision. For example, in the race model, a decision is made when evidence for one alternative reaches an upper threshold. Leaky competing accumulator (LCA) models set the evidence for different options in competition, such that as evidence for one option accumulates, it inhibits evidence for the alternative, and a decision is made when the difference in evidence for the two alternatives reaches a threshold.Sequential sampling models have proven influential in neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. They capture many features of biological decision-making, particularly a speed/accuracy trade-off. The researchers investigated the neural mechanisms of choice in primates and found interacting neural systems for the evaluation of different options and the selection of a choice, involving the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and frontal and parietal cortices. However, most animal brains are much smaller than this complex system. To understand how smaller brains make effective decisions, the team explored honey bee foraging decisions. They measured bees' acceptance and rejection of different options under controlled conditions that manipulated the quality of available evidence and the probability of a rewarding outcome. They then explored their data with signal detection theory and examined how accuracy varied with decision speed. Having identified the key properties of bee decision-making, they then constructed the simplest sequential sampling model capable of the same decision-making capacities as the bee. Finally, they related this abstract model to the known systems of the bee brain to propose a hypothetical brain mechanism for autonomous decision-making in insects.Keywords: computational and systems biology, decision-making, honey bees, signal detection theory, sequential sampling models.
Biguanides, a class of drugs including metformin, the most commonly prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes, have been found to not only lower blood sugar but also promote longevity in various preclinical models. Epidemiological studies in humans also suggest that metformin use is associated with increased longevity and reduced incidence of aging-related diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these health benefits are not fully understood. In a recent study, researchers used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to uncover a role for genes involved in ether lipid biosynthesis in the favorable effects of biguanides. They found that biguanides extend lifespan by stimulating ether lipid biogenesis, and loss of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery mitigates lifespan extension caused by dietary restriction, TOR inhibition, and mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition. The researchers propose that ether lipids are required for activation of longevity-promoting metabolic stress defenses downstream of the conserved transcription factor skn-1/Nrf. Overexpression of a single ether lipid biosynthetic enzyme, fard-1/FAR1, is sufficient to promote lifespan extension. These findings suggest that the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery is a novel therapeutic target for promoting healthy aging.Introduction:Metformin is the most widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic medication for type 2 diabetes, and its use is associated with decreased incidence of cancer and extended lifespan in various preclinical models. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these health benefits are not fully understood. Previous work identified a conserved signaling axis connecting mitochondria, the nuclear pore complex, and mTORC1 inhibition that is required for metformin-mediated lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is necessary for metformin's pro-longevity effects, and the longevity-promoting transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf is required for biguanide-mediated lifespan extension. However, the relationship between these metformin longevity response elements and their hierarchy in the biological response to biguanides remains unknown. Ether lipids, a major structural component of cell membranes, have broad roles in the regulation of cell differentiation, cellular signaling, and reduction of oxidative stress through their action as antioxidants. Humans deficient in ether lipid biogenesis suffer from rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, a rare genetic disorder that results in skeletal and facial abnormalities, psychomotor retardation, and is uniformly fatal before reaching teenage years. Ether lipids have a unique biosynthetic pathway, and ether lipid precursors are first synthesized by enzymes associated with the membranes of peroxisomes. The main enzymes involved in ether lipid biosynthesis within the peroxisomal matrix are glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) and alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS), and fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1) supplies most of the fatty alcohols used to generate the ether linkage in the precursor. In C. elegans, loss-of-function mutations of any of the three main enzymes involved in human ether lipid biosynthesis result in an inability to produce ether-linked lipids and a shortened worm lifespan. However, ether lipid deficient nematodes develop to adulthood at a normal rate, providing an opportunity to determine the biological roles of ether lipids in aging and longevity without pleiotropies associated with developmental rate.Results:The researchers found that the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery is necessary for lifespan extension stimulated by metformin or the related biguanide phenformin in C. elegans. Metabolomic analysis indicates that phenformin treatment drives increases in multiple phosphatidylethanolamine-containing ether lipids through direct biguanide action on C. elegans rather than on the bacterial food source. The requirement for the ether lipid biosynthetic genes extends to multiple genetic longevity paradigms, including defective mitochondrial electron transport function (isp-1
The relationship between bacteria in the gut microbiome and their hosts is crucial for understanding the services that microbiomes provide, including metabolism and host health. However, it is unclear whether these relationships are consistent across hosts or unique to individual hosts. In a recent study, researchers used a modeling framework to analyze extensive time series data from baboons and found that most bacterial correlations were weak, negative, and universal across hosts. They also compared these patterns to human data sets and found that shared correlation patterns dominated over host-specific correlations. The study's findings contribute to the understanding of the universality of bacterial associations across hosts and have implications for microbiome personalization, community assembly, and stability, and for designing microbiome interventions to improve host health.The gut microbiome is home to a diverse range of ecological relationships between bacteria, including mutualisms, competition, parasitism, and predation. These relationships play a significant role in various biological processes, such as metabolism and the synthesis of essential compounds. However, there are gaps in our understanding of microbial relationships in the gut. In particular, it is unclear whether the abundance of one microbe consistently predicts the abundance of other microbes in the same host community, or whether these correlative relationships are consistent in strength and direction across hosts.Previous studies have suggested that microbial relationships may not be consistent across hosts and may instead be individualized to each host. However, recent evidence suggests that microbiome community ecology is not highly individualized and is instead largely consistent across hosts. To test this hypothesis, researchers used a multinomial logistic-normal modeling framework to analyze extensive time series data from baboons, which had similar diets and habitats, over 13 years. They found that most bacterial correlations were weak, negative, and universal across hosts.The researchers also compared these patterns to two human data sets and found that shared correlation patterns dominated over host-specific correlations by almost twofold. Taxon pairs that had inconsistent correlation signs in different hosts always had weak correlations within hosts. From the host perspective, host pairs with the most similar bacterial correlation patterns also had similar microbiome taxonomic compositions and tended to be genetic relatives.The findings of this study have implications for microbiome personalization, community assembly, and stability, and for designing microbiome interventions to improve host health. Understanding the degree to which correlative relationships between microbes are the same or different in different hosts can shed light on whether hosts share similar underlying microbial ecologies, which may make it possible to manipulate the microbiome's emergent properties to improve host health. The study's findings contribute new tools for analyzing the universality of bacterial associations across hosts and have implications for understanding the ecological relationships that mediate gut microbial processes and shape gut microbiome assembly, stability, and productivity.
Gamma oscillations, a type of brain wave activity, are believed to play a crucial role in cognitive processes, particularly in shaping the formation of transient neuronal partnerships on a millisecond scale. These oscillations are linked to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas, possibly reflecting local computations driven by sensory inputs at each breath. In this study, researchers investigated the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex of awake mice to understand their dependence on breathing and how they relate to local spiking activity. They found that respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, which correlate with local feedback inhibition and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. These respiration-driven gamma oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during anesthesia. Functionally, they segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation, leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. This research sheds new light on the mechanisms of gamma oscillations, bridging computation, cognition, and physiology.
The timing of DNA replication during the cell cycle is crucial for proper genome function. In eukaryotic cells, certain regions of the genome replicate late, including intercalary heterochromatin domains. The protein SUUR is involved in the underreplication of these domains, but its mechanism of action is unknown. In this study, researchers used a new method called MS-Enabled Rapid protein Complex Identification (MERCI) to identify a complex called SUMM4, which consists of SUUR and a chromatin boundary protein called Mod (Mdg4) -67. This complex plays a role in the insulator function of gypsy elements, preventing certain enhancer-promoter interactions and establishing euchromatin-heterochromatin barriers in the genome. SuUR and Mod (Mdg4) -67 together also mediate the activities of gypsy insulators and are required for normal spatiotemporal distribution of SUUR in vivo. Mutations in SuUR or mod (mdg4) result in underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin, suggesting that SUMM4 can impart late replication of intercalary heterochromatin by attenuating the progression of replication forks through euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries. This finding reveals a mechanism for the establishment of late replication that does not depend on an asynchronous firing of late replication origins and implicates a SNF2 family ATP-dependent motor protein, SUUR, in the insulator function.
A better understanding of biological aging in children and its relationship to development is important for public health and biomedical research. Biological aging is a set of interrelated molecular and cellular changes that contribute to age-related health conditions. While telomere length is a widely used biological age marker, high-throughput 'omic' methods have led to the development of biological clocks that provide a global measure of changes with age at the molecular level. These clocks, such as DNA methylation-based clocks, have been found to be weakly correlated with each other and can predict age-related phenotypes and mortality. However, the interpretation of biological aging in children is less clear. In this study, researchers aimed to clarify the relationship between biological age indicators, including telomere length, DNA methylation age, and two novel candidate biological age indicators, and child developmental outcomes in European school-age children. The study included up to 1173 children aged between 5 and 12 years from study centers in the UK, France, Spain, Norway, Lithuania, and Greece. The researchers measured telomere length, DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, and metabolites. They found that all biological age markers were associated with greater adiposity, and immunometabolic age was associated with better working memory and reduced inattentiveness, while DNA methylation age was associated with greater inattentiveness and poorer externalizing behaviors. Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors. The findings suggest that biological aging is a complex process, and adiposity is an important correlate of accelerated biological aging. The patterns of associations suggest that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development, while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging. The study was funded by UK Research and Innovation and the European Commission.
Asthma is a complex condition with a significant genetic component, but most of its heritability remains unexplained. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have used a broad definition of asthma, which includes various types of asthma, diluting the genetic signals. In this study, researchers aimed to identify genetic associates of childhood wheezing phenotypes using a novel multivariate GWAS meta-analysis. They analyzed data from 9,568 individuals from five UK birth cohorts, aged from birth to 18 years. Forty-four independent SNPs were identified, each associated with specific types of wheezing phenotypes: early-onset persistent, pre-school remitting, mid-childhood remitting, and late-onset wheeze. A novel locus on chr9q21.13, near the annexin 1 (ANXA1) gene, was identified, which was exclusively associated with early-onset persistent wheeze. The researchers found that the risk allele of rs75260654 confers a reduction in ANXA1 expression, and in a murine model, they demonstrated that loss of ANXA1 results in heightened airway hyperreactivity and Th2 inflammation upon allergen challenge. This pathway may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect. The study was funded by the UK Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.Introduction:Asthma is a complex disorder with a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated to be around 60-70%. Numerous genes have been identified through various approaches, including candidate gene association studies, family-based genome-wide linkage analyses, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, despite the successes, genetic studies of asthma have produced heterogeneous results, and only a small proportion of the heritability is accounted for. One reason for the lack of precise replication is the numerous gene-environment interactions and asthma heterogeneity. Most GWASs used a definition of 'doctor-diagnosed asthma,' which is imprecise and phenotypically and mechanistically heterogeneous. To maximize sample size, most GWASs used a broad definition of asthma, which may dilute important genetic signals. However, there has been little research into the genetic associations of phenotypes derived using data-driven methods. This study aimed to investigate the genetic architecture of wheezing phenotypes from infancy to adolescence, identify genes specific to each phenotype, and better understand the genetic heterogeneity between the disease class profiles.Keywords: genetics and genomics, epidemiology and global health.
Intercropping, the practice of growing multiple crops in the same field at the same time, is a promising approach to increase agricultural sustainability by enhancing productivity and reducing the negative impacts of monoculture farming. However, the benefits of intercropping depend on the interactions between the crops, which can be facilitative or competitive. The ability of crops to adapt to their surroundings and form beneficial interactions has not been well studied in annual crop systems. In this study, researchers investigated how plant-plant interactions and plant traits changed in six different crop species over three generations in monoculture and intercropping conditions. They found that plants growing in the same community type as their parents for two generations showed increased complementarity, with reduced competition or increased facilitation. This led to higher yields in fertilized conditions. Interestingly, the species converged towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content, regardless of whether they were grown in monoculture or intercropping. These findings suggest that parental diversity can affect plant-plant interactions and potentially ecosystem functioning in annual cropping systems. The results may have important implications for diversified agriculture and the development of targeted cultivars for intercropping. However, further studies are needed to assess the context-dependence of these results.
In social interactions, people and animals often make decisions based on observing their partner's actions. To study this phenomenon, researchers have developed a setup called "transparent games," where two agents play game-theoretical tasks on a shared transparent touchscreen display. In a study using this setup, humans and macaques were compared in a game called "Bach-or-Stravinsky," which involves a conflict about which of two opposing options to choose to achieve coordination. Most human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize payoffs. Macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination, but some learned to coordinate dynamically after training with a human confederate. This dynamic coordination was captured by modeling the visibility of the partner's action before one's own movement. The results suggest that action visibility promotes the emergence and maintenance of coordination in dyadic settings. The study illustrates how humans and macaques can coordinate dynamically in a transparent setting, highlighting the importance of observing and timing mutual actions in social interactions.
Researchers have developed a new method to generate human granulosa cells, a key component of ovarian follicles, from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Granulosa cells play a crucial role in follicle formation and supporting oogenesis. While methods to generate human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from hiPSCs have been established, generating granulosa cells has been a challenge. In this study, researchers found that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors, NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2, can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs into granulosa-like cells. These cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes, including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, the granulosa-like cells support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage. This model system will provide valuable opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may lead to the development of therapies for female reproductive health.Introduction:Oogenesis, the process of female reproduction, is less well understood in humans compared to other model organisms. This is partly due to the difficulty in obtaining human fetal ovaries and the lack of a suitable in vitro model system to study human ovarian development. The potential benefits of such a system are illustrated by a recent study in mice, which differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) and ovarian-like cells, and generated live offspring (Yoshino et al., 2021). However, mixed-species systems are inadequate for fully modeling human ovarian development. The development of fully human ovarian follicles from pluripotent stem cells could enable new advances in the study of female reproduction, epigenetics, and human development.Ovarian development requires the interaction of germ cells and several types of somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. While efficient protocols exist for generating hPGCLCs from hiPSCs, a method for generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Ovarian development begins with the specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the posterior epiblast in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. After specification, PGCs migrate to the developing gonad and undergo further development into oogonia. The expression of the RNA-binding proteins DAZL and DDX4 (also known as VASA) begins in gonadal PGCs, with DAZL identified as a key factor that commits PGCs to the germline and restricts pluripotency.Previous studies have provided efficient protocols for the differentiation of hiPSCs to DAZL-negative premigratory PGCLCs. However, none have allowed human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) to develop to later DAZL-positive stages in vitro. The somatic cells of the developing ovary provide crucial support for oogenesis. These cells originate from the WT1-positive intermediate mesoderm and initially exist in a bipotential state, capable of supporting either male or female development. In humans, sex-specific pathways begin to diverge at around 7 weeks post-fertilization (wpf). In male mammals, the Y-chromosomal transcription factor SRY activates a gene regulatory network promoting testis formation and repressing ovary formation. In the absence of SRY, the TF FOXL2 represses the testis factors, allowing ovarian development to proceed. The ovarian somatic cells further differentiate into several lineages, including the granulosa cells, which surround and support developing oocytes. Proper oogenesis depends on a complex interplay of paracrine signaling between somatic and germline cells. Granulosa cells also participate in endocrine signaling, producing estradiol and progesterone, which regulate diverse reproductive functions.Although a few studies have attempted to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to granulosa-like cells through treatment with recombinant signaling proteins, none have resulted in an efficient method, nor have they evaluated their ability to support germ cell development. Manipulation of transcription factors offers
A team of researchers set out to study the genetic basis of skin color variation in a Native American population with significant African ancestry but low frequency of European light skin alleles. They analyzed the genomes of 458 individuals from the Kalinago Territory of Dominica and found that the population had approximately 55% Native American, 32% African, and 12% European genetic ancestry. Skin pigmentation ranged from 20 to 80 melanin units, with an average of 46. Three individuals were identified as albinos, who were found to be homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV of African origin. The frequency of this allele was 0.03, and it had a single allele effect size of -8 melanin units. The researchers also identified two other alleles, SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F, with single allele effect sizes of -6 and -4 melanin units, respectively. Native American genetic ancestry alone reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units. However, none of the published polymorphisms predicted to affect skin color in Native Americans caused detectable hypopigmentation in the Kalinago population. The researchers are continuing their investigation to identify the responsible hypopigmenting genetic variants.The study of human skin pigmentation is important as it is influenced by both genetics and environment. Lighter skin is most common in populations adapted to northern latitudes with lower UV incidence, and is believed to be driven by the need for increased vitamin D production. However, the genetic basis for lighter skin pigmentation specific to Native American and East Asian populations, whose African alleles would be expected to be ancestral, remains to be found. The researchers sought an admixed Native American population with high African but low European admixture to avoid masking effects of European hypopigmenting alleles. They chose the Kalinago Territory of Dominica, which has a primarily Native American and African population, and identified three albino individuals to study. The researchers hope that their findings will contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of skin color variation.Keywords: skin pigmentation, genetics, Native American, African, European, albinism, melanin, Dominica, Kalinago Territory.
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Exercise and antioxidants are two common treatments for diabetes, but their effects on the body are not fully understood. Exercise can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can improve diabetes by promoting glucose catabolism and inhibiting gluconeogenesis. However, excessive exercise can also cause oxidative damage and inhibit the activity and expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of glucose metabolism. Antioxidants, on the other hand, are believed to reduce cytotoxic ROS and oxidative products, thereby alleviating diabetes. However, the exact redox mechanisms of these two approaches are not well understood.In a recent study, researchers compared the effects of moderate exercise and antioxidant intervention on type 2 diabetic rats. They found that moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver, while antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both interventions promoted glucose catabolism and inhibited gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMPK signaling, which is important for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis.During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation, while excessive exercise increased oxidative damage and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK.The findings of this study suggest that both exercise and antioxidant intervention improve blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox state. The AMPK signaling activation, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as sentinel biomarkers, reflecting the threshold of redox balance that is linked to effective glucose control in diabetes. These results provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.
Prey animals have evolved various strategies to escape from predators, one of which is changing the angle of escape trajectory (ET) relative to the predator's approach path. Previous models have suggested a single optimal ET for prey to minimize predation risk. However, many species exhibit multiple preferred ETs. A new geometric model, presented in this study, explains the observed variability in ETs by incorporating the time required for prey to turn and the predator's position at the end of its attack. The model maximizes the time difference between the prey's arrival at the safety zone and the predator's arrival, which is crucial for successful escape. The model was able to explain the multiple preferred ETs observed in fish species, as well as those in insects and frogs, by changing the model's parameters. The findings provide new insights into how animals choose their ETs and open up new avenues for understanding the behavioral and neurosensory mechanisms underlying this important survival strategy.
'Prime editing (PE) is a new genome engineering technology that offers a more precise and efficient way to create designer mutations in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) compared to traditional methods. PE uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA) that functions as a repair template once reverse transcribed. This study compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs and found that PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events, which is useful for creating autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. The researchers also optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components and found that delivering the nCas9-RT as mRNA with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared to transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. This mRNA-based delivery approach can yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and can be used repeatedly to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs. Overall, PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs due to its efficiency and precision.'
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects the production of white blood cells called plasma cells. The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is used to classify MM patients into different stages based on their disease severity and prognosis. However, there is limited knowledge about the differences in gene expression between MM patients at different R-ISS stages. In this study, researchers used single-cell transcriptome sequencing to compare gene expression patterns in MM patients at different R-ISS stages. They found that a novel population of plasma cells (PCs) that expresses the protein NKG7 was enriched in stage II patients. Additionally, a malignant PC population with high expression of MKI67 and PCNA was associated with unfavorable prognosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The researchers also identified the ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) as a potential detrimental marker in MM, as it promotes the proliferation of MM cell lines. The percentage of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells decreased with increasing R-ISS stages, reflecting the plasticity of the tumor immune microenvironment. Importantly, the study identified several potential immunotargets, including SIRPA-CD47 and CD74-MIF, which could be used to develop new treatments for MM. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the gene expression profiles of MM patients at different R-ISS stages and reveals the clinical significance of novel PC clusters and potential immunotargets in MM progression.
Cas7-11 is a single-subunit CRISPR-Cas effector that combines features of both Class 1 and Class 2 systems, making it a unique and promising tool for RNA interference. The structure of Cas7-11 from the bacterium Desulfonema ishimotonii, or DiCas7-11, was determined using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing its molecular structure and the mechanisms behind its RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 has an extended form that resembles the multi-subunit enzymes, but its backbone contains distinct Cas7 and Cas11 domains, leading to its unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 nucleotides of the CRISPR RNA, and its free-standing fragment retains most of the activity. Both the second and third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The structure and mutational data suggest that the long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7 domain has little impact on RNA processing or targeting, indicating the potential for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool. Cas7-11 is a promising platform for developing RNA interference and editing tools due to its potential for viral RNA-induced and protease-mediated antiviral immunity and its unique properties compared to other CRISPR-Cas effectors.
Biodiversity, which includes the variety of different species and the genetic diversity within those species, is essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems and the benefits they provide to people. While much research has focused on the impact of interspecific diversity on ecosystem functions, such as plant productivity, our understanding of how intraspecific genetic diversity affects productivity is limited. In a recent study, researchers used a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to examine the effects of both species diversity and genetic diversity on tree productivity, as well as their relationship to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. The study found that tree species diversity increased productivity through increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity, and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of genetic diversity on productivity were negative in monocultures but positive in mixtures of the four tree species tested. The researchers suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation efforts due to the complex interactions between these factors and their impact on productivity, functional diversity, and trophic feedbacks.The study found that functional diversity, or the variation of species functional traits, promotes community productivity by allowing different species or genotypes to use resources in complementary ways. Genetic diversity within a species can also contribute to intraspecific trait variation, which can have significant effects on plant productivity. However, the extent to which genetic diversity can influence tree productivity through increased functional diversity is not well understood.Trophic feedbacks, which result from the interactions between plants and other trophic groups, have been suggested as an additional mechanism underpinning positive biodiversity effects. These feedbacks can enhance the performance of species or genotype mixtures by reducing herbivore damage and enhancing the diversity of beneficial mutualists, such as mycorrhizal fungi. However, the effects of plant diversity on other trophic groups and the feedbacks of these on productivity have rarely been analyzed in combination.The researchers used data from a long-term tree species × genetic diversity experiment in a subtropical forest to test how tree species diversity and genetic diversity affect tree community productivity via increased functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. They found that tree species diversity increased productivity through increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity, and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of genetic diversity on productivity were negative in monocultures but positive in mixtures. The researchers suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation efforts due to the complex interactions between these factors and their impact on productivity, functional diversity, and trophic feedbacks.
Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but it is challenging to track individual molecules while detecting their interactions. A new technique called proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA) has been developed, which allows one fluorophore (the 'sender') to reactivate a second fluorophore (the 'receiver') from a dark state when they are in close proximity. This property of rhodamine dyes operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and can be used to detect protein-protein interactions and highlight subpopulations of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. In proof-of-concept experiments, PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. This new method provides a valuable way to study molecular interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells.Introduction:Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but it remains challenging to track individual molecules while detecting their interactions. Single-particle tracking (SPT) is a valuable approach for monitoring the motions of individual protein molecules, but it does not distinguish compositionally and functionally distinct complexes of the same protein. Two-color SPT can infer interactions between proteins when both partners are so dilute that they can be fully labeled while still resolving single molecules. However, for most proteins, detection of single molecules requires sparse labeling, making double-labeled complexes rare. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful tool for monitoring intra-molecular conformational changes, but it is not practical for detecting protein-protein interactions in live cells due to the requirement for sparse double-labeling, challenges with spectral crosstalk, and the large size of genetically encoded tags. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) can detect bulk molecular interactions, but it does not provide spatial trajectories for individual molecules, which are useful for measuring properties such as chromatin residence time and anomalous diffusion. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) detects molecular interactions based on the reconstitution of a fluorescent protein or HaloTag from two split halves fused to interacting partners, but it is not practical for single-molecule imaging due to the extremely strong association of split proteins, which perturbs the binding equilibrium of their interacting partners. An alternative in vitro proximity sensor to smFRET was developed using cyanine dyes, but its application as a proximity sensor has been limited by the short inter-fluorophore distance required, poor cell permeability, and the need for high thiol concentrations and an oxygen-scavenging system.To our knowledge, it has not been reported whether a similar process of reactivation can occur for pairs of non-cyanine dyes. However, many fluorophores, notably rhodamine dyes, can enter a dark state and be directly reactivated by short-wavelength (e.g., 405 nm) light. This phenomenon, which has been employed for direct STORM (dSTORM) imaging in both live and fixed cells, is thought to involve conversion of excited triplet-state fluorophores to reduced species whose absorbance is shifted to shorter wavelengths. The development of bright, cell-permeable Janelia Fluor (JF) dyes, based on rhodamine and silicon-rhodamine chemical scaffolds, has transformed single-molecule imaging in live cells. Here, we show that Janelia Fluor X 650 (JFX650) and similar fluorophores can be reactivated from a dark state by excitation of a nearby fluorophore such as Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549), a phenomenon which we term proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA). In contrast to cyanine dye reactivation, PAPA of JF dyes occurs under physiological conditions in live cells and requires neither an oxygen-scavenging system nor exogenous thiols. While PAPA requires proximity between the two fluorophores, its effective distance range extends beyond that of FRET, making it a potentially more versatile interaction sensor. Most importantly, PAPA provides a new way to detect protein interactions in live cells at single-molecule
Calcium is an essential nutrient for bone health, and it's long been debated whether calcium supplementation can increase bone mineral accretion in young people under 35 years old. To clarify this, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize the evidence from 43 studies involving 7,382 subjects. The results showed that calcium supplementation led to a significant increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at the femoral neck and total body, with moderate certainty of evidence. The improvement was more pronounced in the peripeak bone mass (PBM) population (20-35 years old) than the pre-PBM population (<20 years old). These findings suggest that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving PBM may be beneficial for bone health and potentially prevent osteoporosis later in life. The study was supported by a grant from Wenzhou Medical University.Calcium is crucial for bone health, but its role in young populations is controversial. While some studies suggest that increasing calcium intake in older people is ineffective, others argue that intervening before the achievement of peak bone mass (PBM) may have significant benefits. Previous studies have shown positive effects of calcium supplementation on BMD or BMC in children, but the effects in young adults are unclear. Some studies suggest that calcium supplementation has small, nonprogressive effects on BMD or BMC, while others report no effects.To clarify the role of calcium supplementation in young people, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The study searched 8 databases from inception to April 25, 2021, and identified 43 studies involving 7,382 subjects. The results showed that calcium supplementation led to a significant increase in BMD and BMC at the femoral neck and total body, with moderate certainty of evidence. The improvement was more pronounced in the PBM population (20-35 years old) than the pre-PBM population (<20 years old). These findings suggest that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving PBM may be beneficial for bone health and potentially prevent osteoporosis later in life.The study was supported by a grant from Wenzhou Medical University.Keywords: calcium supplementation, bone mineral density, bone mineral content, young population, preventive intervention, peak bone mass.
In the world of biology, there are two types of condensates: liquid and solid-like. These condensates can contain the same molecules but behave differently due to distinct physicochemical properties. For instance, the behavior of these condensates, including their movement, elasticity, and viscosity, can be affected by various factors such as temperature, concentration, and valency. However, it is unclear which factors are most efficient at regulating their behavior. In this study, researchers used influenza A virus (IAV) liquid cytosolic condensates, also known as viral inclusions, to demonstrate that hardening the valency of its components is a more efficient way to regulate their behavior than altering their concentration or temperature.IAV inclusions are liquid structures that play a crucial role in the virus's replication process. They exhibit liquid properties, such as fusing and dividing, dissolving upon shock, and being dynamic. Understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of these inclusions could lead to new antiviral strategies.The researchers found that targeting vRNP (viral ribonucleoprotein) interactions using the known NP (nucleoprotein) oligomerizing molecule, nucleozin, both in vitro and in vivo, hardened the IAV inclusions without affecting host proteome abundance or solubility. This study is a crucial first step in understanding how to specifically target selected biomolecular condensates and offers opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies.In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into the role of valency in regulating the behavior of biological condensates and could lead to the development of novel antiviral approaches.
Kinesin-4 is a unique type of microtubule-based molecular motor that inhibits microtubule dynamics instead of moving cargos along them. Mutations in genes encoding kinesin-4 have been linked to various diseases, but the mechanism by which it inhibits microtubule dynamics is not well understood due to the difficulty of observing its high-resolution structure at the microtubule plus-end. In this study, researchers investigated the role of KLP-12, a C. elegans ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, in proper length control of C. elegans axons and microtubule dynamics inhibition. They found that KLP-12's motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in vitro and that its crystal structure complexed with tubulin revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 on tubulin. The curvature of tubulin introduced by KLP-12 was intermediate between that of the KIF5B-tubulin and KIF2C-tubulin complexes, suggesting that KLP-12 controls axon length by modulating the curvature of microtubule ends to inhibit microtubule dynamics. This discovery provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of kinesin-4's role in microtubule dynamics and could lead to a better understanding of the underlying causes of diseases associated with kinesin-4 mutations.
Female germline stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila are the cells that generate eggs and nurse cells. These cells have the ability to self-renew and launch complex differentiation programs, but the mechanisms behind this are not well understood. GSCs maintain relatively open chromatin and generate a transient syncytial state called a germline cyst, which helps suppress transposable element activity. This is likely achieved through increasing pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification. Once the germline cyst is formed, Neijre/CBP and Myc help upregulate growth and reprogram GSC metabolism by altering mitochondrial transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis, and other processes. This process resembles the development of the totipotent zygote. The authors propose that the totipotent stem cell state was shaped by the need to resist transposon activity over evolutionary timescales.GSCs are located within the adult germarium and give rise to new female germ cells, which develop into ovarian follicles. The follicles then grow and develop into oocytes, which can be fertilized to form a zygote. The zygote then develops into a syncytial embryo before germ cells bud from the posterior pole and form new GSCs.GSCs and developing follicles sense environmental nutrients using insulin/IGS and steroid signaling to maximize oocyte output. Myc, an important regulator of resource adaptation, plays an essential role by controlling hundreds of target genes that regulate both ribosome production and metabolism.The authors extend their knowledge of GSC chromatin modifications and gene expression, showing that upon leaving the GSC state, daughters form germline cysts and upregulate H3K9me3-rich heterochromatin on transposon sequences in centric chromosome regions. This likely protects against transposable element (TE) activity by sharing piRNAs, while heterochromatin formation blocks TE transcription. Polycomb complexes, which depend on the H3K27 methylase enhancer of zeste (E(z)), repress male germ cell and somatic cell genes that are transiently active in GSCs and early daughters. Metabolism is reprogrammed downstream from GSCs to enhance the production in mitochondria of biosynthetic precursors for follicle growth.The results suggest that GSCs and many other highly potent stem cells modulate the mechanisms they use to control TEs as the initial steps in their differentiation program.
Plants, like many organisms, have internal biological clocks that regulate their development and behavior in response to the environment. These clocks can generate daily rhythms, known as circadian rhythms, which coordinate various processes with the earth's rotation. In sunflowers, the circadian clock plays a crucial role in the timing of late-stage floret development, or anthesis. Sunflowers have thousands of tightly packed florets on a capitulum disk, and while early floret development occurs continuously, anthesis happens in discrete ring-like pseudowhorls with hundreds of florets maturing simultaneously.Researchers have found that the circadian clock regulates floral organ growth and that the effects of light on this process are time-of-day dependent. Delayed anthesis can result in fewer pollinator visits, while disrupted circadian rhythms can lead to the loss of pseudowhorl formation and significant reductions in pollinator visits. This coordinated mass release of floral rewards at predictable times of day likely promotes pollinator visits and plant reproductive success.The sunflower circadian clock acts in concert with environmental response pathways to tightly synchronize the anthesis of hundreds of florets each day, generating spatial patterns on the developing capitulum disk. This coordinated timing likely increases the chances of successful pollination and contributes to the plant's overall fitness.Introduction:Biological rhythms are essential for the proper development and functioning of organisms. They can be generated by circadian oscillators, which produce daily rhythms in physiology and behavior, or by developmental oscillators, such as the segmentation clock, which periodically produces modular developmental units. In this study, we explore the role of the circadian clock in controlling the timing of late-stage floret development in domesticated sunflowers.Sunflowers are an excellent model system for studying the temporal regulation of floral development due to their complex inflorescence structure and the precise specification of floret primordia. The circadian clock plays a crucial role in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, known as flowering time, and in coordinating daily rhythms in scent emission and floral opening and closing with pollinator activity. However, its role in the spatial patterning of development has not been previously reported.In sunflowers, individual florets are arranged on the capitulum disk in spiral patterns, called parastichies, which are generated by the precise specification of floral primordia. The timing of anthesis, or floral opening, does not follow the continuous pattern of development seen during the specification of floret primordia on the developing capitulum. Instead, discrete developmental boundaries are observed, with obvious rings of florets at distinct stages of anthesis. Each ring, or pseudowhorl, undergoes anthesis on successive days.Previous studies have examined the effects of hormones and environmental factors on the timing of development of florets within a pseudowhorl. However, the mechanisms governing the conversion of the continuous spiral pattern of development seen early in floral development to the ring-like patterns seen during anthesis have not been explored. In this study, we investigate the timing of floral organ development in various environmental conditions to better understand the role of the circadian clock in this process.Methods:To study the role of the circadian clock in late-stage floret development, we conducted experiments on sunflowers grown under different environmental conditions. We measured the development of both male and female floral organs and the formation of pseudowhorls in constant environmental conditions, with and without light. We also conducted field experiments to assess the impact of anthesis timing on pollinator visits.Results:Our results showed that temperature-compensated daily rhythms in development of both male and female floral organs, and the formation of pseudowhorls, persist in constant environmental conditions in the absence of light. However, both daily rhythms in development and the formation of pseudowhorls are lost in constant light, with late-stage floret maturation occurring continuously along parastichies. Importantly, the effects of light on floret development are time-of-day-dependent.Discussion:Our findings indicate that late-stage floret development is regulated by the circadian clock. The loss of pseudowhorls in constant light and the negative impact on pollinator visits suggest a role for the circadian clock in the spatial as well as temporal control of sunflower development. We propose that pseudowhorls
Hydrogen peroxide is a common reactive chemical that can damage essential life-sustaining biomolecules, and its damaging effects increase with temperature. However, little is known about how organisms cope with this temperature-dependent threat. In a recent study, researchers discovered that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans uses temperature information perceived by sensory neurons to cope with hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacterium Enterococcus faecium. The nematodes preemptively induce the expression of specific hydrogen peroxide defenses in response to high temperature sensed by a pair of sensory neurons. These neurons communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical.C. elegans, a model organism, encounters various bacteria in its ecological setting, including those that produce hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can damage the nematode's DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to developmental defects and even death. To avoid damage from hydrogen peroxide, C. elegans rely on conserved cellular defenses, including H2O2-degrading catalases. However, inducing those defenses at inappropriate times can cause undesirable side effects.Nematodes perceive temperature through seven classes of sensory neurons, and previous research suggested that some of these neurons regulate C. elegans peroxide resistance. In this study, researchers found that hydrogen peroxide lethality to C. elegans increases with temperature. To cope with this, nematodes preemptively induce their hydrogen peroxide defenses at high temperatures. This adaptive response is directed by the AFD sensory neurons, which repress the expression of the INS-39 insulin/IGF1 hormone and thereby alleviate inhibition by insulin/IGF1 signaling of the nematodes' peroxide defenses. The insulin/IGF1 effector DAF-16/FOXO functions in intestinal cells to determine the size of the gene-expression changes induced by the absence of signals from the AFD neurons. By coupling the induction of H2O2 defenses to the perception of high temperature, an inherent enhancer of H2O2 reactivity, the nematodes are assessing faithfully the threat that H2O2 poses.This study provides the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical in response to the perception of an inherent enhancer of that chemical's reactivity. This discovery may have implications for understanding how other organisms cope with temperature-dependent threats and could potentially lead to the development of new strategies for protecting against hydrogen peroxide damage.Keywords: developmental biology, neuroscience, hydrogen peroxide, temperature, C. elegans, insulin/IGF1, sensory neurons, peroxide defenses.
Class switch recombination (CSR) is a crucial process in the adaptive immune system that generates distinct antibody isotypes. This process involves the recruitment of the cytidine deaminase AID, which forms double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. Transcription is required for CSR, and it leads to the formation of R loops within the locus. However, the role of R loops in DSB formation and repair during CSR is unclear. In this study, researchers investigated the impact of R loops on DSB repair by examining cells lacking two enzymes involved in R loop removal: senataxin and RNase H2. They found that these cells exhibit increased R loop formation and genome instability at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus without affecting transcriptional activity, AID recruitment, or CSR efficiency. The researchers propose that senataxin acts redundantly with RNase H2 to mediate timely R loop removal, promoting efficient repair while suppressing AID-dependent genome instability and insertional mutagenesis. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of CSR and the role of R loops in maintaining genome stability.Class switch recombination is a critical process in the adaptive immune system that generates distinct antibody isotypes. It involves the recruitment of the cytidine deaminase AID, which forms double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. Transcription is required for CSR and directly promotes AID recruitment to transcribing switch regions. AID interacts with RNA polymerase II cofactors and the elongation factor complex PAF1, promoting its recruitment to active switch regions. AID also associates with the ssDNA binding protein RPA. Pre-mRNA splicing also plays a role in AID recruitment, and AID shows a binding preference for nucleic acid sequences forming G4 quadruplex structures, which are highly enriched in switch sequences.Transcription at the switch region also induces the formation of R loops, three-stranded nucleotide structures where newly synthesized RNA re-anneals to the DNA template. R loops are more stable in GC-rich sequences, and their formation in switch regions is sequence-dependent and positively correlates with AID deamination. R loops promote AID recruitment by creating an ideal substrate for AID on the non-template DNA strand. However, the enzymes involved in switch region R loop removal and their impact on CSR remain elusive.The RNA exosome promotes AID targeting to both strands of the DNA by helping remove R loops from the template strand, exposing the DNA for deamination. However, studies using ectopic expression of RNase H1 nuclease have produced contradictory results. Some studies suggest that ectopic RNase H1 expression reduces CSR to IgA or IgG1, while others observe no effect on CSR to IgA or IgG isotypes. Transgene-driven expression of murine RNase H1 in primary cells had no effect on CSR to any IgG isotype but increased somatic hypermutation.To investigate the role of R loop removal in DNA DSB repair during CSR, researchers used mouse knockout models of two key enzymes implicated in R loop removal: the helicase senataxin (SETX) and a subunit of the heterotrimeric nuclease RNase H2. SETX and RNase H2 have been implicated in the resolution of R loops and suppression of genome instability from yeast to humans. Further, Sen1 and RNase H activity act redundantly to suppress R loops and maintain cell viability in budding yeast.The researchers found that loss of both SETX and RNase H2 activity (Setx-/-Rnaseh2bf/f) exhibits increased R loops specifically at the Sμ switch region in resting or activated B cells. However, loss of SETX or RNase H2B alone did not consistently increase R loops. This increase in R loops correlates with enhanced genome instability at the heavy-chain locus, as ~10% of double-deficient B cells contain persistent IgH breaks and translocations. The researchers also observed increased mutations and insertion events in SETX- and RNase H2-deficient B cells by molecular analysis of switch junctions, though there was no defect in CSR efficiency.Taken together
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a significant challenge due to the emergence of new, immune-evasive variants, most notably Omicron. These variants can evade the immune response generated by current vaccines, making it urgent to develop broad-spectrum vaccines to combat them. In a recent study, researchers have developed a mosaic-type trimeric form of the spike receptor-binding domain (mos-tri-RBD) as a potential broad-spectrum vaccine candidate. This vaccine carries key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants.Tests on rats showed that mos-tri-RBD elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against not only Omicron but also other immune-evasive variants. The neutralizing antibody ID50 titers induced by mos-tri-RBD were significantly higher than those elicited by homo-tri-RBD (containing homologous RBDs from the prototype strain) or the BIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). These findings suggest that mos-tri-RBD is highly immunogenic and may serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate in combating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron.The emergence of new, immune-evasive variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as Omicron, poses a significant challenge to the protective effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines. The rapid spread of Omicron, which carries 15 mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein, has raised concerns about the efficacy of current vaccines. Preliminary evidence suggests that Omicron may be more transmissible and have a higher reinfection risk than other variants of concern (VOCs).The extensive immune-escape capability of Omicron and other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants from previous infections and vaccinations highlights the urgent need for developing effective broad-spectrum vaccines against these immune-evasive variants. The researchers in this study used structural and computational analyses of the S protein RBD to develop a trimeric form of RBD vaccine candidate, the homologous trimeric RBD (homo-tri-RBD), which has demonstrated potent protection against SARS-CoV-2.To broaden the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variants, the researchers extended their vaccine design scheme to create a mosaic-type trimeric RBD (mos-tri-RBD) vaccine candidate. This vaccine integrates the key mutations derived from Omicron and other VOCs and VOIs into the immunogen. The immunogenicity of mos-tri-RBD was evaluated in rats using live-virus neutralization assays. The results showed that mos-tri-RBD elicited potent broad-reactive neutralizing responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, which was immunogenically superior to homo-tri-RBD and BBIBP-CorV.In conclusion, the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, is crucial to effectively combat the ongoing pandemic. The mosaic-type trimeric RBD (mos-tri-RBD) vaccine candidate, which carries the key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants, shows promise as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate due to its potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Malaria is a deadly disease caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which infects human red blood cells and breaks down the host's hemoglobin protein for survival. One enzyme involved in this process is PfA-M17, a leucine aminopeptidase that provides parasites with essential amino acids for growth, many of which come from hemoglobin. PfA-M17 is essential for P. falciparum survival, and its loss results in parasites with multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage. PfA-M17 is a promising novel drug target as it has no known redundant functions and is not present in humans. The compound used to inhibit PfA-M17's activity blocks parasite growth and leads to parasite death, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent. PfA-M17 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that forms a homo-hexamer in its active form and is most effective at neutral pH. It is believed that hemoglobin-derived peptides are exported from the digestive vacuole into the parasite cytoplasm, where PfA-M17 digests them. PfA-M17 shows almost exclusive selectivity for leucine and tryptophan, making it an important substrate for the isoleucine transporter at the parasite membrane. Repeated attempts to knock out PfA-M17 have failed, indicating its essential role in intra-erythrocytic growth. By creating a conditional knockdown parasite line and designing a specific small molecule inhibitor, researchers have been able to further study PfA-M17's function and confirm its importance in P. falciparum survival.
Aging and myeloid malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), affect the composition and regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which are responsible for producing all blood and immune cells. In this study, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze an enriched population of human HSPCs from young and elderly individuals. They identified changes in the proportions and functionality of HSPC compartments during aging and differences in gene expression dynamics during cell differentiation. Furthermore, they constructed gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and identified regulons specifically active in elderly individuals and MDS patients. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying aging-associated changes in hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. The study demonstrates the power of single-cell technologies and computational analysis tools in understanding complex biological systems and identifying potential therapeutic targets for personalized approaches in individual patients.
Honey bees, like other animals, need to learn which stimuli are important for their survival and which ones are not. One way they do this is through a phenomenon called latent inhibition, where repeated exposure to a stimulus without a reward can delay or reduce the ability to learn an excitatory association with that stimulus. Honey bees, for example, can show latent inhibition towards an odor they have experienced without food reinforcement. Individual honey bees within the same colony can differ in their degree of latent inhibition, and these differences have a genetic basis.To understand the mechanisms underlying these individual differences, researchers selected two honey bee lines for high and low latent inhibition and mapped a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) for latent inhibition to a region of the genome containing the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. They then showed that disrupting Amtyr1 signaling through pharmacological means or RNAi qualitatively changed the expression of latent inhibition but had little effect on appetitive conditioning. These results suggest that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the Central Nervous System (CNS).Electrophysiological recordings from the brain during pharmacological blockade support a model that AmTYR1 indirectly regulates inhibitory synapses in the CNS. The findings identify a distinct Amtyr1-based modulatory pathway for latent inhibition and propose a model for how Amtyr1 acts as a gain control to modulate Hebbian plasticity at defined synapses in the CNS.The neural model also suggests a mechanism for the broad pleiotropy this gene has on several different behaviors. The findings are important for understanding the strategies colonies use to explore for and exploit pollen and nectar resources.Keywords: genetics and genomics, neuroscience, honey bees, latent inhibition, Amtyr1, tyramine receptor.
A team of researchers have developed a new non-invasive imaging technique that allows for the identification and real-time observation of all seven cell types in the airway epithelium of mouse tracheal explants. This method relies on the endogenous autofluorescence signatures of the metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD, which can distinguish cell types based on their unique metabolic profiles. This technique avoids the pitfalls of using cell type-specific markers, which can be altered by physiologic stimuli. The researchers also used this method to identify dynamic secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs) that form in response to cholinergic stimulus. These structures, which have been previously studied in the intestine, are thought to sample antigens and convey their cargo for immune cell processing. The researchers believe that this label-free imaging technique will enable the study of physiologically relevant processes in real time, providing new insights into the function of different cell types in the airway epithelium.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and the inability of the adult heart to regenerate after injury is a major contributor to this statistic. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of m6A in heart regeneration is not well understood. In a recent study, researchers investigated the function of Mettl3 in heart regeneration by modulating its expression in vitro and in vivo. They found that knocking down Mettl3 increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration following injury in neonatal and adult mice. Conversely, overexpressing Mettl3 decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice. The researchers identified Fgf16 as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification during postnatal heart regeneration. They found that Mettl3 negatively regulates Fgf16 mRNA expression in an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent manner. Silencing Fgf16 suppressed cardiomyocyte proliferation, while overexpressing a mutated version of Fgf16 (ΔFgf16) that lacked the m6A consensus sequence significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice. These findings demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces Fgf16 mRNA levels through an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent pathway, thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. This study provides important insights into the role of m6A methylation in heart regeneration and opens up new avenues for developing therapies to promote heart repair.Introduction:Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the inability to regenerate the injured heart after myocardial infarction is a major challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Although various strategies are being explored to promote heart regeneration in animal models and human patients, the efficacy of cardiac therapy and its clinical implications remain uncertain. It has been established that complete cardiac regeneration occurs in neonatal mouse heart after ventricular resection at postnatal day 1 (p1), but this capacity is lost at p7. Cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice is primarily mediated by cardiomyocyte proliferation. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the signaling networks and underlying molecular mechanisms that are responsible for postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. While many studies have focused on the signaling pathways contributing to the activation of proliferative factors that regulate gene expression in hearts, the potential roles of post-transcriptional regulation of cardiac mRNAs in cardiac physiology and pathology are largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that mRNA abundance does not always correlate with protein expression in failing hearts, and nuclear and cytosolic mRNA levels are not correlated in cardiomyocytes. These reports suggest that epitranscriptomic regulation plays an important role in healthy and pathological hearts. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), is the most prevalent and best-characterized mRNA modification. Recent studies have demonstrated that m6A plays an important role in gene regulation, animal development, and human disease. However, the roles of this post-transcriptional process and functions of m6A mRNA methylation in cardiomyocyte proliferation and animal models of heart regeneration remain unknown. In this study, we elucidate the landscape of m6A mRNA methylation during heart regeneration in neonatal mice and show that inhibition of the methylase Mettl3 promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. We further demonstrate that post-transcriptional downregulation of Fgf16 by Mettl3-mediated m6A modification via a YT521-B homology (Ythdf2) -dependent pathway, inhibits heart regeneration in neonatal mice.Keywords: heart regeneration, cardiomyocyte proliferation, N6-methyladenosine, methyltransferase-like 3, Fgf
The risk of developing a second primary cancer (SPC) after the first primary cancer (FPC) has been a topic of interest in cancer research due to the increasing number of cancer survivors. However, the causal relationship between FPC and SPC remains unclear. In a recent study, researchers conducted a pan-cancer association study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the UK Biobank (UKB) to investigate the relationship between FPC and SPC. They found that there were 11 significant cross-correlations between different cancers, but only 4 of them were confirmed to have a robust causal relationship. For instance, patients with oral pharyngeal cancer had an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and ovary cancer was a risk factor for soft tissue cancer. Kidney cancer was likely to cause the development of lung cancer and myeloma. These findings suggest that certain types of primary cancers may cause another second primary cancer, and further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. The study was supported by various grants and was published in the journal Oncotarget.
Researchers have found that people and nonhuman primates, including macaques, make economic decisions based on the perceived value of items while shifting their gaze between options. Recent studies suggest that gaze biases, such as choosing items that are viewed first, last, or for the longest duration during a trial, play a role in these decisions. To understand the underlying mechanism of gaze-related choice biases, researchers developed a novel value-based choice task for macaque monkeys. This task allowed monkeys to freely deploy their gaze to the options on the screen and make a manual response to indicate their choice. Using this task, researchers identified gaze biases in monkeys that were similar to those in humans. They also found that these gaze biases could be explained using a sequential sampling model framework, which assumes that evidence for a given item accumulates faster while it is being viewed. This is the first time this framework has been used to assess value-based decision mechanisms in nonhuman primates. These findings suggest a common mechanism for gaze-related choice biases across species and open the way for further research to identify the neural origins of this behavior.
Phytophagous insects, which feed on plants, exhibit a wide range of dietary niches, from specialists that feed on a few or even a single plant species, to generalists that can consume multiple plant families. The mechanisms behind this dietary breadth are not well understood, with two hypotheses being proposed: metabolic generalism, where insects use a common set of metabolic pathways to process a variety of plant compounds, or multi-host metabolic specialism, where insects have distinct metabolic adaptations for each host. In this study, the researchers investigated the metabolomes of fruit diets and the fruit fly Drosophila suzukii, which has a remarkably large diet breadth. They found that individuals of this generalist species had a canalized, generic response to biochemically dissimilar diets, supporting the metabolic generalism hypothesis. However, many diet-specific metabolites were not metabolized by the insects and instead accumulated in their bodies, even when potentially detrimental to their fitness. This suggests that dietary generalism may emerge from a passive, opportunistic use of resources, which could later lead to new diet specializations. The findings of this study provide insights into the mechanisms behind dietary generalism and highlight the importance of considering the metabolic consequences of a wide dietary range.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a bacterium that causes mild intestinal infections in mammals, evolved into the highly virulent and flea-borne pathogen Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. This transformation occurred through a series of genetic changes, one of which was the frameshift mutation in the rcsD gene. This mutation resulted in the production of a small protein, RcsD-Hpt, and full-length RcsD. The rcsD mutation occurred after the pseudogenization of rcsA, another important gene in the Rcs signaling pathway. This mutation altered the canonical Rcs phosphorylation signal cascade, fine-tuning biofilm production to be compatible with the retention of the pgm locus in modern lineages of Y. pestis. This finding suggests that the frameshift mutation in rcsD is an important evolutionary step that fine-tuned biofilm production to ensure the perpetuation of flea-mammal plague transmission cycles.Yersinia pestis is unique among enteric Gram-negative bacteria in its reliance on flea-borne transmission. It is transmitted to mammals through the bite of an infected flea, which forms a biofilm in the flea's proventriculus, blocking feeding and promoting regurgitation of infected blood to the bite site. This leads to two types of transmission: early phase, which requires several infected fleas feeding on a naive host, and biofilm-dependent late-stage transmission, which is highly efficient and can be transmitted by a single blocked flea.The Rcs signaling system is a non-orthodox two-component signal transduction system that consists of a hybrid sensor kinase RcsC, the phosphotransfer protein RcsD, and a response regulator RcsB. The Rcs system plays a crucial role in regulating biofilm formation in Yersinia. In Y. pseudotuberculosis, the functional RcsA protein works in concert with RcsB as a heterodimer to inhibit biofilm formation. However, in Y. pestis, RcsA was disrupted by acquiring a 30 bp repeat insertion sequence, leading to enhanced capacity for biofilm formation. The rcsD gene in Y. pestis is a putative pseudogene due to a 1 bp deletion, but it retains a limited ability to modulate biofilm formation in vitro.The rcsD frameshift mutation in Y. pestis results in the production of RcsD-Hpt, a 103-amino acid protein containing the C-terminal HPt domain of RcsD. This protein plays a dominant role in Rcs signaling in Y. pestis. The frameshifted rcsD alters Rcs signal transduction, subsequently modulating the expression of dozens of genes and the capacity for biofilm formation in Y. pestis. These evolutionary events may represent an important step in the emergence of ubiquitous branches of Y. pestis that can capably maintain plague outbreaks.Keywords: microbiology, infectious disease, evolution, Yersinia pestis, Rcs signaling system, biofilm formation, frameshift mutation.
'Peer review is a crucial step in the scientific publishing process, ensuring the quality and validity of research. However, concerns have been raised about its subjectivity and potential biases. To investigate this, a study analyzed 500 peer review reports from neuroscience papers using OpenAI's generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT. The analysis revealed that most reviews were favorable and polite, but there was significant variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper. The study also found that female first authors received less polite reviews than male peers, and papers with female senior authors received more favorable reviews. ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional language models in analyzing the reviews. These findings highlight the potential of generative artificial intelligence in studying equitability in scientific publishing and identifying areas of concern in peer review. The study also showed that ChatGPT can accurately identify language use and sentiment in scientific texts, which is crucial for maintaining scientific integrity and improving the overall quality of scientific publications.'
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and deadly form of cancer, and hepatic metastases, or liver tumors, are a poor prognostic factor for patients. New strategies to prevent liver colonization by CRC are needed, and a promising approach is the use of interferon-alpha (IFNα) therapy. In this study, researchers used mouse models to demonstrate that continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of IFNα can control CRC invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). Mechanistically, IFNα promotes the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche in the liver, characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) that have defenestrated, thickened extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition. This strengthens the liver vascular barrier, impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration, without requiring a direct action on tumor cells, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes, or liver dendritic cells, Kupffer cells, or liver capsular macrophages. Additionally, IFNα endows LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential, leading to the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.Introduction:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Surgical resection of the primary CRC tumor is the mainstay of treatment, but up to 50% of patients develop life-threatening liver metastatic disease despite chemotherapy and targeted adjuvant therapies. While surgery has overall benefits, it may also contribute to liver metastases by increasing the dissemination of CRC cells into the portal circulation, enhancing their adhesion to the liver endothelium, or promoting transient immunosuppression and the awakening of dormant intrahepatic micrometastases. Given the limitations of current treatments, there is growing recognition that perioperative immunotherapies may represent a unique treatment window to prevent metastatic colonization and control minimal residual disease. Interferon-alpha (IFNα), a pleiotropic cytokine with multiple antitumor effects, has been used as adjuvant immunotherapy in various solid cancers, but its systemic administration has shown limited clinical efficacy due to its short plasma half-life and systemic side effects. To overcome these limitations, strategies to prolong IFNα half-life and target the tumor microenvironment have been explored, including a preclinical gene/cell therapy approach that delivers constant amounts of IFNα into the liver to significantly curb CRC metastatic growth. In this study, researchers used a continuous intraperitoneal (ip) IFNα delivery strategy to show that steady and tolerable doses reduce liver CRC metastatic spreading and improve survival in several CRC mouse models.Results:The researchers found that the antimetastatic effects of IFNα do not rely on the direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation or the indirect stimulation of hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, liver dendritic cells, Kupffer cells, or liver capsular macrophages. Instead, they identified HECs, including LSECs, as key mediators of IFNα-dependent antitumor activities. These activities involve the impairment of CRC trans-sinusoidal migration and the development of long-term anti-tumor CD8+ T cell immunity.Conclusion:The findings from this study provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver. By acting on HECs, particularly LSECs, IFNα creates a vascular antimetastatic niche that strengthens the liver vascular barrier and supports the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and long-term memory T cell responses. These results have important implications for the development of new strategies to prevent liver metastases in CRC patients undergoing surgical resection.Keywords: interferon-alpha, colorectal cancer, liver metastases, hepatic endothelial cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, antitumor immune response, perioperative immunotherapy.
Swine influenza, caused by the influenza A virus (IAV), is a significant concern for both the swine industry and public health due to its ability to evolve rapidly and transmit between humans, pigs, and birds. Vaccination is the primary method used to prevent influenza in pigs, but the impact of vaccination on the emergence of IAV reassortants and genetic variation is not well understood. In this study, researchers directly sequenced bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains. They identified 54 reassortant viruses, with vaccinated pigs having fewer reassortants than non-vaccinated pigs due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected. However, vaccination had limited impact on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. The results suggest that vaccination not only limits virus replication in pigs but also protects public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential. The study highlights the importance of understanding the impact of vaccination on IAV evolution in pigs to effectively control transmission between humans and pigs.Introduction:Influenza A virus (IAV) is a significant pathogen in humans, birds, and pigs, causing significant disease burden and economic losses. Swine influenza is a major concern for the US swine industry due to its impact on pig health and profitability. Swine and humans share the same IAV subtypes, making pigs a potential source of novel IAV strains with zoonotic and pandemic potential. IAV continuously evolves through antigenic drift and shift, making disease prevention challenging. Minimizing IAV diversity is a key strategy for controlling transmission between humans and pigs. Swine are susceptible to avian, human, and swine-origin IAV, and the distribution of IAV receptors in the swine respiratory tract promotes co-infections and reassortment. Co-infections and reassortment can result in new viruses with distinct genetic constellations, some of which have become the predominant circulating strains in swine populations and have caused fatal infections in people. Vaccination is the primary method to prevent influenza in pigs, but breakthrough infections are common due to the virus's ability to evolve rapidly to escape host immunity. Understanding how immunity induced by swine IAV vaccination shapes within-host virus evolution in pigs is crucial for controlling the disease and the emergence of novel antigenic variants. Previous studies have characterized the IAV mutational spectra within naïve and vaccinated pigs and other mammals, but in vivo studies on how vaccination impacts reassortment between multiple subtypes of IAVs in pigs are lacking. Additionally, most knowledge on IAV within-host diversity in pigs is based on samples taken from nasal cavities, and studies quantifying IAV within-host variation in pig lungs are lacking. The pig lungs harbor IAV populations with the most extensive genomic variations, making it essential to evaluate the impact of immune pressure on IAV evolutionary trajectories by evaluating the extent of IAV reassortment and mutational spectra taking place concurrently in naïve and vaccinated pigs. In this study, researchers performed next-generation sequencing directly on BALF samples and IAV plaques purified from the BALF samples to identify the virus mutations and reassortment that happened in swine lungs.Keywords: influenza A virus, swine influenza, vaccination, reassortment, genetic variation, pig health, public health.
Researchers have long been interested in understanding the role of the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for memory formation, in storing memories of aversive experiences. One theory suggests that place cells, which fire selectively in specific locations in space, may encode mnemonic information about past experiences in addition to spatial maps. Previous studies have shown that place cells can change their firing patterns, or remap, in response to behaviorally significant events. However, it is unclear whether this remapping plays a role in storing memories for aversive experiences.To investigate this question, researchers performed in vivo calcium imaging of CA1 place cells in freely behaving rats. They first trained rats to prefer a short path for food reward, then trained them to avoid the short path by delivering mild footshocks. The researchers then assessed remapping by comparing place cell population vector similarity before acquisition versus after extinction of avoidance.Some rats received scopolamine, an amnestic drug that impairs avoidance learning but spares spatial tuning and shock-evoked responses of CA1 neurons. The results showed that place cells remapped significantly more following remembered than forgotten shocks. This remapping did not cause place fields to migrate towards or away from the shocked location and was similarly prevalent in cells that were responsive versus non-responsive to shocks.When rats were exposed to a neutral barrier instead of aversive shock, place cells remapped significantly less. These findings suggest that place cell remapping occurs in response to events that are remembered rather than merely perceived and forgotten, and may play a role in storing memories for aversive events.
HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, triggers an inflammatory response in the body that can help the virus spread and establish a reservoir. This response is mediated by the inflammasome, a protein complex that activates the immune system in response to infections or damage. In this study, researchers investigated the effects of blocking the inflammasome using a drug called VX-765, which inhibits the activity of caspase-1, a key component of the inflammasome. They used mice with human immune cells and found that VX-765 reduced inflammation, viral load, and the loss of CD4+ T cells in the spleen. These findings suggest that targeting the inflammasome early in HIV-1 infection could be a potential strategy for preventing the establishment of the viral reservoir and reducing inflammation, which could lead to an HIV cure. The researchers also discussed the role of the inflammasome in HIV-1 infection and the potential benefits of targeting it for HIV treatment.Introduction:HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, affects around 38 million people worldwide and every year, 1.7 million new infections occur. While antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress viral replication, it is not curative and does not fully resolve HIV-associated inflammation and immune dysfunction. HIV-induced inflammation can contribute to the persistence of the viral reservoir, which in turn drives inflammation and can lead to comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Strategies targeting the mechanisms of HIV-induced inflammation are being evaluated to reduce the viral reservoir and achieve an HIV cure.The inflammasome is a protein complex that plays important roles in innate immunity and inflammation as multiprotein signaling platforms sensing pathogens and regulating cellular functions. Upon recognition of microorganisms or danger signals, the inflammasome is activated, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death. HIV-1 has been shown to induce the formation and action of an inflammasome in several cell types and models.Effects of VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice:The researchers used humanized NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and infected them with HIV-1. They found that expression of caspase-1, NLRP3, and IL-1β was increased in lymph nodes and bone marrow between day 1 and 3 after HIV-1 infection. IFI16 and AIM2 expression peaked at day 24 and coincided with increased IL-18 levels, increased viral load, and CD4+ T cells loss in blood. Treatment with VX-765 significantly reduced TNF-α at day 11, IL-18 at day 22, CD4+ T cells (44.3% vs 36.7%), viral load (4.26 vs 4.89 log 10 copies/ml), and total HIV-1 DNA in the spleen. These results suggest that targeting inflammasome activation early after HIV-1 infection may represent a therapeutic strategy towards HIV cure to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion and reduce immune activation, viral load, and the HIV-1 reservoir formation.Conclusion:The study demonstrates that targeting inflammasome activation early after HIV-1 infection may be a potential therapeutic strategy towards HIV cure. The findings provide insight into the role of the inflammasome in HIV-1 infection and the potential benefits of targeting it for HIV treatment. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of VX-765 on HIV-1 infection and to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent for HIV cure.Keywords: HIV-1, inflammasome, caspase-1, VX-765, NLRP3, IL-1β, IFI16, AIM2, CD4+ T cells, viral load, HIV-1 reservoir, HIV cure.
Prairie voles, a socially monogamous rodent species, form opposite-sex pair bonds and exhibit behaviors and physiological responses similar to humans when their partners are separated. In this study, researchers investigated how pair bond-associated behaviors and transcriptional signatures change following partner separation. They found that opposite-sex pair bonding led to stable changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region involved in reward, motivation, and action selection. However, these transcriptional signatures eroded following prolonged partner separation. The eroded genes were associated with gliogenesis and myelination, suggesting a previously undescribed role for glia in pair bonding and loss. The researchers also used neuron-specific translating ribosomal affinity purification in voles to identify gene clusters sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation, including dopaminergic-, mitochondrial-, and steroid hormone signaling-associated genes. These findings suggest that pair bond loss erodes transcriptomic signatures of pair bonding despite core behavioral features remaining intact, revealing potential molecular processes that may prime the vole to form a new bond.
 Motor development in infants is a complex process involving the emergence of motor primitives and motor variability. Motor primitives are basic coordination patterns that allow infants to perform various movements, while motor variability enables exploration and learning. In this study, researchers followed 18 infants from birth to walking onset and recorded their leg muscle activity during locomotor movements. Using unsupervised machine learning, they found that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development. In the neonatal period, infants have a minimal number of motor primitives but generate maximal motor variability. However, as infants grow older, they generate less variability despite having more primitives due to more regularity within their activation. These findings suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives, which later become more consistently activated. Understanding the relationship between motor primitives and variability is crucial for understanding motor development. While a low-dimensional modular system may limit motor exploration, data from animals suggest that variability could be generated within a modular system during development. The human motor system could potentially initiate its exploration by variably activating a few temporary basic structured patterns.
The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium (GTGC) was established to bring together researchers and public health professionals to analyze Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data and inform public health action. The consortium analyzed 13,000 Typhi genomes, the largest collection to date, and found that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa, while distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in other regions. The data revealed that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium aims to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi and inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies. The data gaps in many parts of the world were highlighted, and travel-associated sequences were shown to provide informal ‘sentinel’ surveillance for such locations. The consortium is funded by fellowships from the European Union, the Wellcome Trust, and the National Health and Medical Research Council.
Plants, like many organisms, have evolved mechanisms to adapt to their environment and ensure optimal growth and reproduction. One such mechanism is vernalization, a process triggered by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures that promotes flowering in many plant species. In Arabidopsis thaliana, vernalization is achieved through the epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor gene, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which prevents flowering until the appropriate spring conditions arrive. The process of FLC silencing involves the cold-induced antisense RNA COOLAIR, which is transcribed from the FLC locus and facilitates FLC silencing.The researchers in this study investigated the role of C-repeat (CRT) and dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) at the 3′-end of FLC and the CBF transcription factors (CBFs) that bind to these elements in the cold-mediated expression of COOLAIR. They found that CBFs bind to CRT/DREs at the 3′-end of FLC both in vitro and in vivo, and that CBF levels increase gradually during vernalization. Cold-induced COOLAIR expression is severely impaired in cbfs mutants, which lack all CBF genes, and is increased in CBF-overexpressing plants even at warm temperatures.The researchers also found that COOLAIR is induced by CBFs during early stages of vernalization but its levels decrease in later phases as FLC chromatin transitions to an inactive state to which CBFs can no longer bind. They further demonstrated that cbfs and FLCΔCOOLAIR mutants exhibit a normal vernalization response despite their inability to activate COOLAIR expression during cold, revealing that COOLAIR is not required for the vernalization process.In conclusion, this study provides evidence that CRT/DREs and CBFs are required for cold-mediated expression of COOLAIR, which plays a role in the early stages of FLC silencing during vernalization. The findings add to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the vernalization process in Arabidopsis thaliana.
HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, is a lifelong infection that requires continuous antiretroviral therapy to keep it under control. While researchers have studied the HIV-1 reservoir cells in the blood, there is little information about the distribution of HIV-1-infected cells in other parts of the body, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, researchers used advanced sequencing techniques to examine HIV-1 proviral sequences in various tissues from three individuals who had been on antiretroviral therapy. They found that lymph nodes and, to a lesser extent, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tissues were major sites for the persistence of intact HIV-1 proviruses. However, they also detected intact proviruses in the CNS, particularly in the basal ganglia. The researchers observed that HIV-1-infected cells proliferated in multiple tissues, including the CNS, and identified clonal proliferation in the basal ganglia, frontal lobe, thalamus, and periventricular white matter. Understanding the distribution of HIV-1 reservoirs in different tissues is crucial for developing strategies to eliminate the virus and find a cure for HIV-1 infection.
Circadian clocks are internal systems that regulate the 24-hour rhythms of gene expression, physiology, and behavior in almost all living organisms. These clocks exist in various tissues and are thought to control tissue-specific functions, synchronized by the brain clock. However, it is unclear how circadian clocks fail during disease states, as it is difficult to monitor tissue-specific clock function in intact organisms. In this study, researchers developed a new method called Locally Activatable BioLuminescence (LABL) to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live, intact Drosophila. Using this method, they observed that specific neuronal and peripheral clocks exhibit distinct transcriptional properties. They also found that loss of the PDF receptor, a circadian neurotransmitter critical for brain clock function, disrupts circadian locomotor activity but not all tissue-specific clocks. Peripheral clocks in non-neuronal tissues were less stable after the loss of PDF signaling, but they continued to oscillate. The researchers also found that distinct clocks exhibit differences in their loss of oscillatory amplitude or their change in period, depending on their anatomical location, mutation, or fly age. LABL is an effective tool that allows rapid, affordable, and direct real-time monitoring of individual clocks in vivo, which will be critical in the interrogation of distinct circadian clocks in future studies, particularly in monitoring peripheral clock function during disease progression in Drosophila.
The endosome, a membrane-bound organelle, plays a crucial role in the recycling of proteins and membranes within cells. The endosome's identity and function are determined by the presence of specific lipids and proteins, including the phosphoinositide 3-phosphate (PI3P) and Rab5-like GTPases. The VPS9-domain guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) Muk1 and Vps9 are responsible for activating these endosomal Rab5-like GTPases. In yeast, VPS9-domain GEFs stimulate the endosomal Rabs Vps21, Ypt52, and Ypt53, which in turn activate PI3P production and recruit effectors, including coat proteins and vesicle tethers, to the endosomal membrane.Sorting nexins (SNXs) are a family of proteins that perform direct roles in endosomal trafficking by binding to transmembrane cargo proteins and enriching them into sorting domains. SNXs localize to the endosome through conserved Phox homology (PX) domains that recognize PI3P. A subfamily of SNXs, called SNX-BARs, contains a Bin/Amphiphysin/RVS (BAR) domain that mediates dimerization with other BAR domain-containing proteins and imparts membrane binding/deforming properties.The retromer complex, a heteropentameric complex composed of the Vps26-Vps35-Vps29 trimer and the Vps5-Vps17 SNX-BAR dimer, is the best-characterized SNX-BAR-containing complex. Retromer promotes the retrograde sorting of cargo, including the well-characterized carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) receptor Vps10, from the endosome and vacuole. In metazoans, retromer specifically refers to the VPS26-VPS35-VPS29 trimer that associates with a variety of adaptor proteins to promote cargo sorting.Vrl1, a novel VPS9-domain protein, was previously identified as a non-functional protein in commonly studied yeast strains. However, recent studies have shown that Vrl1 functions as a SNX-BAR coat complex and a VPS9-domain GEF, which we have named VINE (VPS9-domain INteracting complex). VINE occupies endosomal tubules and redistributes a conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like protein from endosomes. Membrane recruitment by Vin1, the paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5, is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity. These findings suggest that VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome.
Marine ecosystems are complex networks of interactions between various fish species, and understanding how temperature affects these interactions is crucial for predicting the impact of climate change on marine communities. However, measuring and quantifying fish interactions under field conditions is challenging. In this study, researchers used environmental DNA (eDNA) metababarcoding to analyze interaction strengths between 550 fish species in the Boso Peninsula, Japan, over two years. They detected and quantified pairwise interactions and found that water temperature influenced fish-fish interaction strengths. The impact of temperature on interaction strengths varied among fish species, with some species, such as Halichoeres tenuispinis and Microcanthus strigatus, experiencing stronger interaction strengths with increasing water temperature, while others, like Engraulis japonicus and Girella punctata, had decreased interaction strengths. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering fish species identity when studying temperature effects on interactions and contribute to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.
A recent study published in the journal "Scientific Reports" has provided new insights into the evolution of avian eggshells, specifically those of the Palaeognathae clade, which includes modern birds like ostriches, rheas, and tinamous. The researchers used electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to analyze the microstructure and crystallography of eggshells from various Palaeognathae species, as well as some selected Neognathae and non-avian dinosaur eggshells.The study revealed that the previously categorized ostrich- and tinamou-style eggshell morphotypes are not homologous, but rather homoplastic, meaning they were independently acquired. The researchers also found that the rhea-style eggshell represents the ancestral state of palaeognath eggshells in both microstructure and crystallography.These findings have significant implications for both ornithology and palaeontology. In ornithology, the study provides a better understanding of how the macrostructure, microstructure, and crystallography of eggs have evolved within the avian clade. In palaeontology, the study offers a modern analogue for understanding the evolution of eggshells in non-avian dinosaurs, as the molecular clock approach is not feasible for non-avian dinosaur eggs due to the lack of preserved DNA.The study also highlights the importance of a revised phylogeny of Palaeognathae for understanding the evolution of avian eggshells, as previous morphology-based phylogenies have been largely superseded by molecular approaches. The researchers suggest that future research could focus on the functional significance of the observed differences in eggshell microstructure and crystallography, as well as the role of environmental factors in shaping eggshell evolution.Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the evolution of avian eggshells and their role as a useful archive for comparative contrasts in various fields, including palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, geochronology, and zooarchaeology.
A new system called Hybrid Vocalization Localizer (HyVL) has been developed to improve the precision of localizing ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rodents, which are important for communication and navigation in many species and are increasingly used in neurodevelopmental and neurolinguistic research. HyVL combines a high-resolution acoustic camera with high-quality ultrasonic microphones, achieving millimeter precision (~3.4-4.8 mm) in localizing USVs, three times better than other systems. This improved precision allows for a more accurate analysis of mouse courtship interactions, revealing that males and females vocalize in different relative positions and that the fraction of female vocalizations has likely been overestimated due to imprecise localization. The system also allows for the identification of a dominant male in triadic courtship interactions, which emits most USVs and positions itself closer to the female. HyVL is affordable, open-source, easy to set up, and reduces the required number of experiments and animals. This system will significantly improve the precision with which social communication between rodents can be studied, paving the way for the discovery of essential drug targets for various neurological and developmental disorders.
Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle fibers that generate force. They are made up of actin and myosin filaments, which are held together by the large protein titin. In vertebrates, titin spans the entire length of a sarcomere, connecting the actin and myosin filaments and ensuring sarcomeric integrity. However, the role of titin in determining sarcomere architecture outside of vertebrates is not well understood. In this study, researchers used nanobodies, which are small antibody fragments, to determine the precise location of the two Drosophila titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, in intact flight muscles. They found that Sallimus bridges across the I-band, while Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band. Interestingly, the ends of both proteins overlap at the I-band/A-band border, suggesting a staggered organization of the two Drosophila titin homologs. This architecture may help anchor Sallimus to the myosin filament and ensure efficient force transduction during flight. Understanding the precise organization of titin homologs in different species can provide insights into how sarcomere length is determined and maintained in various muscles.
A team of researchers have developed a new method to measure the elastic and viscous properties of individual cells using a simple, high-throughput, and low-cost microfluidic system. This method can help researchers understand higher level cellular functions in health and disease. The cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and pumped through a microfluidic channel, causing large deformations and tank-treading motion. From the cell deformation and tank-treading frequency, the researchers extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic properties of the cells. The method was confirmed to be accurate using atomic force microscopy-calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells. The results showed that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell-cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks. This method can be used for dose-response measurements of drugs that induce actin cytoskeleton disassembly and can provide insights into the mechanical properties of cells.Introduction:Cells carry out complex mechanical tasks such as cell division, adhesion, migration, invasion, and force generation. These mechanical activities are essential for higher order cell functions including differentiation, morphogenesis, wound healing, or inflammatory responses. Measuring the viscoelastic properties of cells can help elucidate these functions in health and disease. For example, the activation of neutrophils in response to pro-inflammatory agents is typically accompanied by a marked increase in cell stiffness, which can lead to sequestration of the stiffened cells in small capillaries and may be relevant for the progression and exacerbation of inflammatory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019. In this report, the researchers describe a quantitative, low-cost, high-throughput, and simple method to measure the viscoelastic properties of cells, specifically the storage modulus G′ and the loss modulus G′′.Method:The cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and pumped at pressures of typically between 50 and 300 kPa through a several centimeter long microfluidic channel with a square cross section. The fluid shear stress induces large cell deformations that are imaged using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera at frame rates of up to 500 frames/s to achieve a measurement throughput of up to 100 cells/s. The method takes advantage of two physical principles: the shear stress profile inside a long microfluidic channel depends only on the pressure gradient along the channel and the channel geometry, and the cells rotate in a tank-treading manner due to the flow speed of the suspension fluid in contact with the cell surface facing the channel center being larger compared to the flow speed at the opposite side.Results:The results showed that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell-cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks. The method can be used for dose-response measurements of drugs that induce actin cytoskeleton disassembly and can provide insights into the mechanical properties of cells.Conclusion:The new method provides a simple, high-throughput, and low-cost way to measure the viscoelastic properties of cells, which can help researchers understand higher level cellular functions in health and disease. The method can be used for dose-response measurements of drugs and can provide insights into the mechanical properties of cells. The results showed that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell-cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks.
Cardiac muscles have the highest concentration of mitochondria among all human tissues, yet mitochondrial dysfunction is not a known cause of isolated cardiomyopathy. A rare genetic mutation in the mitofusin 2 (MFN2) gene, specifically the R400Q variant, is over-represented in clinical cardiomyopathy, but not in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). To understand the unique characteristics of this mutation, researchers studied its enzymatic, biophysical, and functional properties.All MFN2 mutants had impaired mitochondrial fusion, the primary function of MFN2. However, MFN2 R400Q and M376A had normal GTPase activity but impaired conformational shifting, unlike the T105M mutant that lacked catalytic GTPase activity and exhibited normal activation-induced changes in conformation. MFN2 R400Q did not suppress mitochondrial motility, mitochondrial depolarization, or mitochondrial respiration like MFN2 T105M and M376A. Instead, it was uniquely defective in recruiting Parkin to mitochondria.CRISPR editing of the R400Q mutation into the mouse Mfn2 gene resulted in perinatal cardiomyopathy with no other organ involvement, while knock-in of Mfn2 T105M or M376V did not affect the heart. RNA sequencing and metabolomics of cardiomyopathic Mfn2 Q/Q400 hearts revealed signature abnormalities, recapitulating experimental mitophagic cardiomyopathy. Cultured cardiomyoblasts and in vivo cardiomyocytes expressing MFN2 Q400 had mitophagy defects with increased sensitivity to doxorubicin.MFN2 R400Q is the first known natural mitophagy-defective MFN2 mutant. Its unique profile of dysfunction suggests a mechanism for enrichment in clinical cardiomyopathy, evoking mitophagic cardiomyopathy. This study provides new insights into the relationship between MFN2 mutation site, protein dysfunction, and disease manifestation.
Research suggests that the first few weeks of a mouse's life can significantly impact its health and lifespan. Previous studies have shown that manipulations of litter size, growth hormone levels, or mutations affecting early-life growth rate can influence mouse lifespan. Additionally, the pace of early development in mice can be affected by olfactory cues, particularly those from same-sex adult mice, which can delay maturation. In this study, researchers hypothesized that olfactory information might also have a sex-specific effect on lifespan. They found that the lifespan of female mice was significantly increased when exposed to the odor of adult females between the ages of 3 and 60 days. However, male lifespan was not affected by female odors, nor was female lifespan affected by male odors. The researchers also found that the absence of the G protein Gαo in the olfactory system, which affects accessory olfactory system function and reproductive priming responses to male odors in females, did not modify the effect of female odors on female lifespan. These findings suggest that very young mice are susceptible to influences that can have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later life, and provide an example of lifespan extension by olfactory cues in mice.
Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) are a powerful tool in neuroscience and sleep research, allowing researchers to control specific cell populations using chemical actuators. However, the effects of the most commonly used DREADD actuator, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), on sleep have not been thoroughly studied. In this study, researchers investigated the impact of CNO on sleep in wild-type mice using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG). They found that CNO suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in a dose-dependent manner, altered EEG spectral power during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and changed sleep architecture in a pattern similar to clozapine. Interestingly, a novel DREADD actuator, compound 21 (C21), also affected sleep, despite not converting to clozapine. These findings suggest that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying the side effects of chemogenetic actuators. The researchers suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could be a useful tool for testing the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators.Introduction:Chemogenetics is a widely used experimental approach in sleep research and could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic strategy in sleep medicine. Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) enable non-invasive and cell type-specific remote control of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. In the context of sleep research, DREADDs are used to probe the contribution of selected neuronal populations in controlling vigilance states, sleep state-specific network oscillations, sleep-related physiology, and behavior. Typically, intraperitoneal injections of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) are used to activate excitatory hM3Dq or inhibitory hM4Di DREADDs. It was initially thought that CNO is pharmacologically inert and not back-metabolized to its parent drug clozapine in mice. However, recent studies have shown that CNO is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites, including clozapine. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia, and its broad binding profile to neurotransmitter receptors may account for its high efficacy compared to other antipsychotics. CNO itself has been found to bind to a range of neurotransmitter receptors and elicit behavioral effects at doses commonly used for DREADD experiments. It is widely believed that CNO does not affect sleep, and many chemogenetic sleep studies include control experiments with DREADD-free animals to demonstrate the absence of relevant effects of the chosen CNO preparations and doses on the assessed sleep parameters. However, a comprehensive assessment of the potential dose-dependent effects of CNO on sleep in wild-type mice has never been systematically conducted. Given that clozapine is a sedating antipsychotic drug known to modulate sleep in humans and laboratory rodents, it is important to understand its effects on sleep in the context of DREADD experiments.Methods:Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were used for this study. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled vivarium with a 12-hour light-dark cycle. For the CNO experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with CNO at doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg. For the C21 experiments, mice were injected with C21 at a dose of 3 mg/kg. EEG and EMG recordings were obtained using a 16-channel system. Data were analyzed using custom-written MATLAB scripts and the EEGLAB toolbox.Results:CNO suppressed REM sleep in a dose-dependent manner, altered sleep architecture parameters, and increased frontal EEG power spectra of NREM sleep. These effects were similar to those reported for clozapine. C21 also affected sleep, resulting in a pattern of sleep modulation with effect sizes comparable to those of the 5 mg/kg CNO condition.Discussion:These findings demonstrate that both CNO and C21 can modulate sleep in wild-type mice, suggesting that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying the side effects of chemogenetic actuators. The results highlight the importance of including a DREADD-free control group
Microorganisms navigate their environment through chemotaxis, the process of moving towards or away from chemical stimuli. Understanding the role of various chemical compounds and concentrations in microbial processes, such as nutrient uptake and chemorepulsion from toxins, is crucial for ecosystem function and human health. Traditional microfluidic chemotaxis assays have been used to study these processes, but they have limitations in terms of throughput and the range of concentration gradients they can test. To address this, researchers have developed a novel microfluidic multiplexed chemotaxis device (MCD) that can perform six parallel bacterial chemotaxis assays on a single chip, spanning five orders of magnitude in chemostimulant concentration. The MCD uses serial dilution to generate precise chemical gradients and has been validated against a standard microfluidic assay. The device's versatility was demonstrated by measuring the chemotactic responses of different bacteria to various chemoattractants and chemorepellents. The MCD significantly accelerates the chemotaxis screening process, which is essential for deciphering the complex chemical stimuli underlying microbial responses. This high-throughput device will enable researchers to identify the key metabolites and signaling chemicals that drive microbial chemotaxis in various complex systems.
Neural crest cells are essential for the development of various tissues in vertebrates, including craniofacial structures and the peripheral nervous system. While the transcriptional control of neural crest development is well understood, recent studies suggest that post-transcriptional regulation plays a role in modulating the output of these regulatory circuits. In this study, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing data from avian embryos to identify potential post-transcriptional regulators and found that Elavl1, which encodes for an RNA-binding protein involved in transcript stability, was enriched in the premigratory cranial neural crest. Knocking down Elavl1 resulted in premature neural crest delamination and a reduction in transcripts associated with the neural crest specification gene regulatory network (GRN). The primary target for Elavl1 stabilization during cranial neural crest specification was identified as Draxin, a canonical Wnt inhibitor. RNA-sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA decay measurement, and proximity ligation assays confirmed that Elavl1 stabilizes Draxin mRNA, and exogenous Draxin rescued cranial neural crest specification defects observed with Elavl1 knockdown. These findings demonstrate that Elavl1 plays a critical role in maintaining cranial neural crest specification via Draxin mRNA stabilization, highlighting the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in neural crest development.
Breathing is a vital function for survival, and the neural circuits that control it are complex and not well understood. At the heart of these circuits are neurons called Dbx1-derived interneurons, which generate the rhythm and pattern of breathing, and phrenic motor neurons (MNs), which provide the final motor output that drives diaphragm muscle contractions during inspiration. The mechanisms that dictate how these respiratory circuits assemble are unknown. In this study, researchers found that coordinated activity of a type I cadherin (N-cadherin) and type II cadherins (Cadherin-6, -9, and -10) is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output. Inactivating these cadherins during a critical developmental window in mice results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a significant reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. This combinatorial cadherin code is necessary to establish phrenic MN cell body and dendritic topography. Surprisingly, cell body position appears to be dispensable for the targeting of phrenic MNs by descending respiratory inputs. These findings demonstrate that type I and II cadherins function cooperatively throughout the respiratory circuit to generate a robust breathing output and reveal novel strategies that drive the assembly of motor circuits.
Social media platforms have become a significant source of information for many people, but the spread of misinformation on these platforms is a major concern. The researchers in this study propose that the existing incentive structure of social media, where social rewards like 'likes' and 'shares' are not contingent on the veracity of the information, facilitates the spread of misinformation. To test this hypothesis, the researchers conducted six experiments with 951 participants, introducing 'trust' and 'distrust' buttons as new engagement options. The results showed that participants used these buttons to discern true from false information more effectively, leading to an increase in the proportion of true information shared and a decrease in the proportion of false information shared. The researchers also found that the use of 'trust' and 'distrust' buttons reinforces user behavior that generates trustworthy material and signals to others that the post is dependable. The study suggests that altering the incentive structure of social media platforms to make rewards and punishments contingent on accuracy could be an effective intervention to reduce the spread of misinformation. The findings of this study could have implications for reducing violence, vaccine hesitancy, and political polarization, without reducing engagement.
Microtubules are essential structures in cells that help transport materials from one place to another. During cell division, microtubules play a crucial role in separating chromosomes by pulling them apart. The mechanism behind this force generation has been a topic of debate, with two main theories: biased diffusion and conformational wave. The biased diffusion theory suggests that the kinetochore, which attaches chromosomes to the microtubules, undergoes a random walk along the microtubule surface, which is biased towards the tip due to its affinity for the microtubule. The conformational wave theory, on the other hand, proposes that curling protofilaments at the disassembling tips physically hook the kinetochore and pull against it to generate force.To test the conformational wave hypothesis, researchers have studied the mechanical energy output of curling protofilaments in vitro. They found that adding magnesium to the solution increases the mechanical energy output of both yeast and bovine microtubules. This increase in energy output can be explained by the fact that magnesium lengthens the protofilament curls, without changing their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. These findings demonstrate that the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubule lattice is conserved across species and suggest that the mechanical properties of curling protofilaments can be tuned to generate force.Understanding how microtubules generate force is important for understanding cell division and other microtubule-driven movements in cells. The findings from this study could also have implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches for diseases that involve microtubule dysfunction.
Hagfishes, a type of jawless fish, are known for their unique defense mechanism: the production of a fibrous hydrogel called defensive slime. This slime is made up of long threads and mucous, which expand rapidly when released into the water, creating a barrier that entangles predators. The origin of this slime is not well understood, but recent research suggests that it may have evolved from the epidermis, the outermost layer of the fish's skin.In this study, researchers examined hagfish epidermis and found large intracellular threads within a putatively homologous cell type. These threads, which averaged 2 mm in length and 0.5 μm in diameter, were present throughout the fish's body, with each square millimeter of skin storing approximately 96 cm of threads. When the skin was damaged, these threads were released along with mucous, forming a less dilute and more fibrous slime than the defensive slime.Transcriptome analysis supported the idea that epidermal threads are ancestral to the slime threads, with gene duplication and divergence occurring in parallel with the evolution of slime glands. The results suggest that the evolution of stronger and more voluminous slime may have been driven by selection.The hagfish's body is covered in a dense layer of epidermal thread cells, which may have evolved into the thread-producing cells in the slime glands. These cells, called epidermal thread cells (ETCs), produce a dense mass of granules in the distal region of the cell, which are not released via merocrine or apocrine modes. Instead, it is hypothesized that ETCs rupture and release their contents when the skin is damaged, such as during interactions with predators.The researchers found that the threads produced by ETCs are shorter than slime threads but are present throughout the hagfish's body. When hagfish skin is damaged, it releases an adhesive and fibrous slime containing threads and granules released from ruptured ETCs. Comparative transcriptome analysis and phylogenetic analysis of α and γ protein sequences revealed that the thread proteins expressed in hagfish skin are evolutionary sisters to those found in slime glands.Overall, the findings support the hypothesis that slime glands arose from epidermis, and that the selective pressures that drove this transition may have included the need for stronger and more voluminous slime to aid in the hagfish's survival.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common and debilitating form of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, often accompanied by neuropsychiatric and cognitive comorbidities. Current treatments, such as anti-seizure medications, do not modify the disease or its comorbidities, and are only effective for a small percentage of patients. Sodium selenate, a compound that activates the primary tau phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), has been shown to reduce hyperphosphorylated tau (h-tau) and improve outcomes in animal models of epilepsy. However, it is unclear if sodium selenate can be a disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for chronic epileptic rats. In this study, researchers investigated the effects of sodium selenate treatment on epileptic and behavioral outcomes, as well as molecular pathways, in chronically epileptic rats using the kainic acid (KA) post-status epilepticus (SE) model of TLE. The results showed that sodium selenate treatment was associated with a reduction in seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and sensorimotor deficits, as well as increased PP2A expression, reduced h-tau, and reversed telomere length shortening. Integration of multi-omics and pre-clinical outcomes identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with TLE. These findings provide evidence that sodium selenate is a DMT for chronic epileptic rats, improving comorbid learning and memory deficits.Introduction: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults and is often accompanied by disabling neuropsychiatric and cognitive comorbidities. Current treatments, such as anti-seizure medications, do not modify the disease or its comorbidities and can have significant side effects.

Ten weeks post-SE, animals received sodium selenate, levetiracetam, or vehicle subcutaneous infusion continuously for 4 weeks. One week of continuous video-EEG was acquired before, during, and 4, 8 weeks post-treatment, followed by behavioral tests. Targeted and untargeted proteomics and metabolomics were performed on post-mortem brain tissue to identify potential pathways associated with modified disease outcomes. Telomere length was investigated as a novel surrogate marker of epilepsy disease severity.Results: Sodium selenate treatment was associated with mitigation of measures of disease severity at 8 weeks post-treatment
'Fragility fractures, which are common in older adults, not only cause pain and disability but also increase the risk of mortality. However, the concept of mortality risk is not easily understood or communicated between doctors and patients. In this study, the authors propose a new concept called "Skeletal Age" to help convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual. Skeletal Age is defined as the sum of a person's chronological age and the number of years of life lost due to a fracture. Using data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register, the authors found that during a median follow-up period of 16 years, there were 307,870 fractures and 122,744 post-fracture deaths. A fracture was associated with between 1 and 7 years of life lost, with hip fractures resulting in the greatest loss. Skeletal Age was estimated for each age and fracture site stratified by gender. This new metric could help improve doctor-patient communication about the risks associated with osteoporosis and encourage earlier intervention. The authors suggest that Skeletal Age could be a useful addition to existing metrics such as Heart Age and Lung Age, which have been shown to have a better clinical impact than traditional absolute risk metrics. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide a more intuitive way to understand the combined risks of fracture and mortality, which could lead to better management of osteoporosis and ultimately save lives.

Brain tissue extraction is a crucial step in analyzing brain structure and function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, current methods for extracting brain tissue are limited and not generalizable across different species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed a new method called Brain Extraction Net (BEN), a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network. BEN is designed to be flexible and generalizable, allowing for accurate brain tissue extraction across various species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. The researchers evaluated BEN on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans. Compared to conventional toolboxes, BEN showed superior robustness, accuracy, and generalizability. It also significantly improves the accuracy of atlas registration, benefiting downstream processing tasks. BEN is an open-source software designed to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications. The lack of a comprehensive and generalizable method for brain tissue extraction across different species, MRI platforms, and modalities has been a significant challenge in neuroimaging studies. Current methods are inflexible, as they are designed for specific species, modalities, or platforms, and lack automatic quality assessment, requiring labor-intensive manual curation when erroneous segmentation occurs. BEN addresses these issues by being flexible and generalizable, allowing for accurate brain tissue extraction across different species, MRI platforms, and modalities. It also incorporates an uncertainty-based assessment module, allowing it to autonomously control the quality of brain segmentation mask outputs. The researchers believe that an automated and generalizable brain extraction tool such as BEN can reduce intra- and interrater variability and increase throughput for the labor-intensive brain extraction task, facilitating many neuroimaging studies.
Candida albicans, a common fungal pathogen, can survive in various environments, including those with limited iron availability. To acquire iron, this fungus uses a family of extracellular proteins called CFEM hemophores to capture heme from host proteins and transfer it to the cell membrane for endocytosis and utilization. In this study, researchers identified two proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, that are required for heme utilization and sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. Frp1 and Frp2 lack an extracellular N-terminal substrate-binding domain but redistribute to the plasma membrane in the presence of hemin, suggesting a direct role in heme trafficking. The CFEM hemophores and Frp1/2 share sequence and structural similarities, indicating that they form a functional complex that evolved from ferric reductases (FREs) to enable extracellular heme uptake. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms of heme acquisition by C. albicans and could have implications for developing new strategies to combat fungal infections.
Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium responsible for the seventh pandemic of cholera, is known for its ability to rapidly adapt to changing environments, which enables its recurring outbreaks. Two sensory proteins, ToxR and ToxS, located at the inner membrane, play a crucial role in this adaptation process. ToxR and ToxS react to environmental stimuli, such as bile acid, and induce survival strategies, including bile resistance and virulence regulation. A recent study has revealed the crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS in combination with multiple bile acid interaction studies. The findings suggest an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. This discovery supports the previously suggested link between ToxRS and VtrAC-like co-component systems. The ToxRS complex is highly conserved across various Vibrio species, emphasizing the significance of conserved residues in the ToxS barrel and the more diverse ToxR sensory domain. Understanding the mechanisms governing ToxRS's environmental sensing capabilities holds promising implications for disrupting this vital interaction, ultimately inhibiting Vibrio's survival and virulence. The findings have far-reaching implications for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings.Introduction:Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal cholera disease, is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for 21,000-143,000,000 deaths worldwide per year. Its sudden outbreaks and environmental persistence cause significant economic and health damage. V. cholerae exhibits a life cycle between dormant and virulent states, which is maintained by its rapid adaptation to changing environments. This survival mechanism is enabled by sensory proteins that react to environmental conditions and substances, such as bile acid, which plays a major role in virulence activation. ToxR, a transmembrane transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of numerous genes and can function as an activator, co-activator, and repressor. It is proposed to act as an environmental sensor, binding bile acids and consequently activating transcription with its cytoplasmic DNA binding domain. ToxS, a protein built of a periplasmic, a transmembrane, and a short cytoplasmic region, interacts with the periplasmic domain of ToxR, forming a stable heterodimer, thereby protecting ToxR from periplasmic proteolysis and enhancing its activity. The exact mechanism of ToxR functionality is not clear, but it is proposed to bind DNA as a homodimer at 'tox-boxes' or using a topological DNA recognition mechanism. The versatile functionality of ToxR suggests a general role of ToxRS in Vibrio strains. However, the exact mechanism of how bile significantly alters V. cholerae virulence remains unclear, with studies reporting opposite outcomes in regard to up- or downregulation of virulence factors by bile.The presented crystal structure of the sensory domains of V. cholerae ToxR and ToxS reveals ToxS as a main environmental sensor in V. cholerae. The ToxRS complex exposes a bile binding pocket inside ToxS lipocalin-like barrel that is only properly built via stabilization by newly formed structural elements of ToxR. Multiple interaction experiments combined with extensive molecular dynamic MD simulations reveal a bile binding ToxRSp complex, revealing contributions from both proteins to the interaction with bile acid. ToxRSp shows structural and functional similarities with bile sensing complex VtrAC from V. parahaemolyticus, further supporting a common superfamily of co-component signal transduction systems whose sensory function is strictly connected to an obligate heterodimer formation. AlphaFold-Multimer structure predictions reveal a conserved fold of ToxS in different Vibrio species, in contrast to ToxR exhibiting a structural variability among different Vibrio strains.Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing ToxRS's environmental sensing capabilities provides a promising tool for disrupting this vital interaction, ultimately inhibiting Vibrio's survival and virulence. The findings hold far-reaching implications for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings.
The human hippocampus, a brain structure important for memory and spatial navigation, is a complex structure with multiple subregions and functional differences along its anterior-posterior axis. However, the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these functional differences are not well understood. In this study, researchers used advanced imaging techniques to examine the anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus. They identified the most highly connected cortical areas and determined where these areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. The results provide new insights into how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and highlight the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. The findings inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.The hippocampus is known to be highly connected with multiple cortical areas, including the entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and posterior parahippocampal cortex. However, direct cortico-hippocampal pathways are not limited to these structures. Previous studies have revealed that specific cortical areas preferentially connect with circumscribed portions along the anterior-posterior axis of hippocampal subfields. For example, the retrosplenial cortex in the parietal lobe has direct connectivity with posterior portions of the presubiculum, while area TE in the inferior temporal lobe displays preferential connectivity with posterior portions of the CA1/subiculum transition area.Despite this knowledge, detailed characterizations of human hippocampal connectivity are essential to advance our understanding of the neural architecture that underpins hippocampal-dependent memory and cognition in the human brain. However, investigating structural connectivity of the human hippocampus in vivo has been challenging due to technical difficulties in probing hippocampal connectivity with sufficient detail.In this study, researchers used diffusion MRI data with multiple diffusion strengths and high angular resolution combined with track density imaging (TDI) to characterize structural connectivity between the whole hippocampus and cortical and subcortical brain regions. They found that the most highly connected brain regions were the temporal lobe followed by subcortical, occipital, frontal, and parietal regions. The study provides important insights into the complexity of human hippocampal structural connectivity but leaves important gaps in our knowledge. Specifically, there has been no systematic examination of structural connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus, and we do not know where, within the hippocampus, specific cortical areas preferentially connect.To address these gaps in knowledge, the researchers used a processing pipeline specifically tailored to study hippocampal connectivity and aimed to systematically examine the patterns of structural connectivity between cortical brain areas and the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus. They identified the spatial distribution of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus associated with each cortical area, providing fundamental insights into how specific cortical areas preferentially connect along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus and where streamlines associated with a given cortical area preferentially connect within the hippocampus. These detailed anatomical insights will help fine-tune network connectivity models and have an impact on current theoretical models of human hippocampal memory function.
The immune system plays a crucial role in protecting our bodies from harmful pathogens. One part of the immune response is the detection of cytoplasmic DNA by a protein called cGAS, which then activates another protein called STING. STING is important for the body's defense against viruses, but mutations in the STING pathway have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. To understand if chronic activation of the STING pathway can cause neurodegeneration, researchers studied a mouse model with a constantly active version of STING. They focused on dopaminergic neurons, which are particularly sensitive to stress and are affected in Parkinson's disease. In these mice, they found that the number of dopaminergic neurons and their terminals were reduced, along with a decrease in dopamine levels in the brain. The mice also showed signs of alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation, as measured by astroglia and microglia, was already elevated in young mice, even before the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The researchers also found that neuroinflammation was reduced in mice lacking inflammasomes, but neurodegeneration was still present. These findings suggest that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Targeting the STING pathway could be beneficial in treating Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to fight cancer, has shown remarkable success in some cases, but most patients experience only partial response followed by relapse of resistant tumors. The reason for this resistance is not well understood, but it is not due to the loss or editing of targeted antigens or downregulation of HLA molecules in the tumor cells, as these cells still express immunogenic clones. Instead, tumor cells have been found to form unique structures called cell-in-cell formations, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. These formations are predominantly formed by IFNγ-activated T cells, which induce phosphorylation of transcription factors STAT3 and EGR-1 in tumor cells. Inhibiting these factors before immunotherapy improves its therapeutic efficacy. This discovery highlights a limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism that allows tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity.
Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand that other beings have mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. This ability has been extensively studied in humans using animations of simple geometric shapes, such as the Frith-Happé animations, which feature triangles moving in different ways. While humans have been shown to distinguish between different mental states depicted in these animations based on their gaze patterns and brain activations, the same has not been consistently observed in nonhuman primates. In this study, researchers investigated how marmosets, a highly social primate species, process Frith-Happé animations by examining their gaze patterns and brain activations. They found that both marmosets and humans exhibited longer fixations on one of the triangles in the ToM animations compared to other conditions. However, marmosets did not show the same pattern of longer overall fixation duration on the ToM animations as humans. Furthermore, both species activated extensive and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM versus random animations, suggesting that marmosets differentiate between these scenarios in a similar way to humans. While marmosets did not mimic human overall fixation patterns, their gaze behavior and neural activations indicate a distinction between ToM and non-ToM scenarios. This study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities and sheds light on potential similarities and differences in ToM processing between marmosets and humans.
Stem cells have the unique ability to maintain their undifferentiated state while also having the potential to develop into different cell types when needed. The transition from a stem cell state to a differentiated cell state requires precise regulation of gene activity. Transcription and translation are two key mechanisms that help control gene activity in stem cells. However, understanding the fine-tuning of gene transcription in stem cells is challenging due to the compensatory effect of translational control. In this study, researchers focused on the neural stem cells of fruit flies, specifically intermediate neural progenitor cells (INPs), to investigate the mechanisms that fine-tune stemness gene transcription. They found that the transcription factor FruitlessC (FruC) plays a crucial role in this process. FruC binds to cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely expressed in neuroblasts and negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. Loss of fruC function alone has no effect on INP commitment but drives INP dedifferentiation when translational control is reduced. The findings suggest that low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.
Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are known for their role in fighting infections, but they also play a crucial role in removing dead cells in the liver. Contrary to the belief that neutrophils are excluded from apoptotic sites to prevent tissue inflammation, a new study reveals that they are the predominant phagocytes responsible for the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver. Instead of engulfing dead cells from the outside, neutrophils burrow directly into the apoptotic cells, a process called perforocytosis, and ingest the cells from the inside. The absence of neutrophils leads to defective removal of apoptotic bodies, tissue injury in the mouse liver, and the generation of autoantibodies. Human autoimmune liver disease shows similar defects in neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes. This study reveals a new, immunologically silent mechanism for neutrophils in the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes and highlights the importance of this function in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Defects in this process have been linked to autoimmune liver disease.
Motor control is essential for producing complex movements in animals, and it is achieved through the precise activation of muscle groups around a joint. Motor neurons, which control muscle activation, are regulated by a network of interneurons within the spinal cord. The arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal circuits. Previous studies have suggested that premotor interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools are organized in a topographic manner, with flexor and extensor premotor interneurons having mediolateral positional biases. However, a new study using multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains. This finding challenges the idea that motor instructions are processed in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components. The study highlights the importance of using multiple complementary methods to minimize systematic biases and obtain a more accurate understanding of motor circuit organization.
Respiration, the process of breathing, can impact brain activity during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans, leading to both artifacts and real neural effects. While respiration-related artifacts are commonly removed during data processing, recent studies suggest that respiration may also directly influence neural activity in the brain. To investigate this relationship, researchers used rats to simultaneously record electrophysiology, rsfMRI, and respiration signals. Their findings revealed a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and gamma-band power in the anterior cingulate cortex. This relationship was also linked to a specific rsfMRI network, which disappeared when brain-wide neural activity was silenced but respiration remained. These results suggest that respiration influences brain activity through a neural mechanism, distinct from respiration-related artifacts. This discovery opens new avenues for understanding the interactions between respiration, neural activity, and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions.
Greater mouse-eared bats, a species that primarily feeds on ground-dwelling insects through passive listening, have the ability to switch to aerial hunting when environmental conditions make ground feeding less profitable. Using biologging devices and DNA metabarcoding of feces, researchers found that these bats use two foraging strategies: gleaning from the ground and aerial hawking. While the average number of insects caught per bat was similar for both strategies, the success rate was much higher for aerial hunting (76%) compared to ground gleaning (30%). However, due to the larger size of ground prey, 85% of the nightly food acquisition came from ground sources. The researchers found that most bats used the same strategy on a given night, suggesting that they adapt their hunting behavior to weather and ground conditions. The study concluded that greater mouse-eared bats primarily use high-risk, high-gain gleaning of ground prey but switch to aerial hunting when environmental changes reduce the profitability of ground prey. This finding highlights the importance of prey switching in maintaining energy intake for even specialized predators.
The evolution of human right-handedness, or the preference for using one hand over the other, has been a topic of debate for decades. To better understand the factors that may have contributed to the development of human right-handedness, researchers have studied manual lateralization patterns in non-human primates. However, limited data and inconsistent methodologies have made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. In a new study, researchers compiled data on hand preferences for standardized object manipulation in 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans.The study found that human right-handedness is indeed an extreme among anthropoids, and population-level handedness is rare. Species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates, but hand preference strength showed signatures of both ecology and phylogeny. Terrestrial primates tend to display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species, which challenges the postural origins hypothesis.The results suggest that there may be an adaptive benefit to disparate lateralization strength in primates, a measure of hand preference that has been overlooked in the past. Additionally, human lateralization patterns do not align with trends found among other anthropoids, suggesting that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species.The study also highlights the importance of considering both ecology and phylogeny when studying primate handedness evolution. The postural origins hypothesis, which suggests that primate ancestors exhibited a right-hand bias for supporting their bodies on vertical substrates, is challenged by the findings. Instead, the researchers propose that arboreal primates may have a left-hand bias for manipulation, while terrestrial primates may evolve right-hand preferences for fine motor skills.Overall, this study provides a comprehensive comparative perspective on the origins of human right-handedness in the context of object manipulation. The findings challenge popular ideas on primate handedness evolution and point to the importance of considering both ecology and phylogeny when studying this phenomenon.
Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 7,500 people. It is characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, hypersocial behavior, and cardiovascular abnormalities. There are currently no pharmacological treatments for the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a role in both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential target for treating WBS. In this study, researchers analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation on key phenotypes relevant to WBS. CD mice, which have a hemizygous deletion of a region containing 26-28 genes at chromosomal band 7q11.23, showed a hypersocial phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids. Subchronic treatment with JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Additionally, JZL184 treatment improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results suggest that modulating the ECS could be a promising new therapeutic approach for improving key phenotypic alterations in WBS.Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 7,500 people. It is characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, hypersocial behavior, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Despite the significant impact of these symptoms on quality of life, there are currently no pharmacological treatments for the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a role in both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential target for treating WBS.The ECS is a homeostatic modulatory system that is involved in a wide range of physiological functions at both central and peripheral levels. It is composed of cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands or endocannabinoids, and the enzymes involved in the synthesis and inactivation of these ligands. The main enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) are 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), respectively. Their degradation is controlled mainly by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) for 2-AG and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) for AEA. CB1R and CB2R are both G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mainly signal through inhibitory Gi/o proteins. CB1R is highly expressed in different brain regions, including the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, where it is mainly located at presynaptic terminals. Endocannabinoids act as retrograde messengers that bind to presynaptic CB1R and control neurotransmitter release at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.The ECS regulates various behavioral responses, including sociability, cognition, and emotional responses, which are often impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders. In fact, multiple lines of evidence suggest that alterations of the ECS play a role in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental conditions. For example, alterations of the ECS have been described in several mouse models for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and pharmacological modulation of the ECS has been shown to restore social abnormalities in some of these models. Additionally, approaches targeting the ECS have been demonstrated to improve cognitive impairment and plasticity in mouse models of Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome.In this study, researchers investigated the brain components of the ECS in the WBS CD model to find significant alterations in CB1R expression and G-protein coupling in specific brain regions. They also revealed that subchronic administration of the MAGL
During the development of an organism, it goes through various stages, each characterized by distinct morphological and molecular changes. For instance, in humans, development progresses from childhood to puberty and then to adulthood. Similarly, in insects like flies, development goes through an intermediate pupal stage where the immature juvenile form transforms into the adult. The identity of these stages is determined by the sequential expression of transcription factors, including chinmo, Br-C, and E93. However, how these factors determine temporal identity in developing tissues is not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated the role of the larval specifier chinmo in larval and adult progenitor cells during fly development. They found that chinmo promotes growth in larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. The absence of chinmo during metamorphosis is critical for proper adult differentiation. Additionally, the researchers found that Br-C and E93 act as tumor suppressors, contrasting the well-known role of chinmo as a pro-oncogene. Furthermore, the function of chinmo as a juvenile specifier is conserved in hemimetabolous insects. Overall, these results suggest that the sequential expression of the transcription factors Chinmo, Br-C, and E93 during larva, pupa, and adult stages, respectively, coordinates the formation of the different organs that constitute the adult organism.
 Co-substrate cycling, a process where a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions, is a common feature in metabolism. While energy and electron carriers like ATP and NAD(P)H are well-known co-substrates, there are other metabolites that act as cycled co-substrates in various parts of central metabolism. In this study, researchers developed a mathematical framework to analyze the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux. They found that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct from the limit imposed by the primary enzyme catalyzing that reaction. This limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. By simulating branched and coupled pathways, they showed that regulation of these two parameters can control flux dynamics. They also identified several reactions in central carbon metabolism that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. Understanding and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells.
Articular cartilage is a type of cartilage that covers the ends of bones in synovial joints, allowing for smooth movement between bones. The development and differentiation of articular chondrocytes, the cells that make up articular cartilage, is not well understood. In this study, researchers identified the nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) as a crucial regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation during development. NFATc1-expressing cells were mainly located in the flanking region of the joint interzone at the early stage of mouse knee development. As development progressed, these cells generated almost all articular chondrocytes but not chondrocytes in the limb growth-plate primordium. NFATc1-expressing cells had the ability to form colonies and differentiate into multiple cell types. Transcriptome analyses revealed a set of characteristic genes in NFATc1-enriched articular cartilage progenitors. The expression of NFATc1 was diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppressing NFATc1 expression in articular cartilage progenitors induced spontaneous chondrogenesis. Mechanistically, NFATc1 negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene. These results reveal that NFATc1 characterizes articular, but not growth-plate, cartilage progenitors during development and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation at least partly through regulating COL2A1 gene transcription. This finding provides new insights into the identity and origin of articular cartilage progenitors and identifies a fundamental function of NFATc1 in determining physiological articular chondrocyte differentiation.
Photosystem II (PSII) is a crucial component of photosynthesis, responsible for converting light energy into chemical energy. This process involves the splitting of water and reduction of quinone, which requires a significant amount of energy. PSII can use different types of chlorophylls, such as chlorophyll a (Chl-a), chlorophyll d (Chl-d), and chlorophyll f (Chl-f), to perform these reactions using different energy levels. Two types of PSII, found in certain cyanobacteria, use Chl-d and Chl-f instead of Chl-a for most of their chlorophylls. It was predicted that these far-red PSII would have lower efficiency or resilience to photodamage due to the lower energy levels. In this study, researchers compared the efficiency, forward electron transfer, back-reactions, and photodamage in Chl-f-PSII, Chl-d-PSII, and Chl-a-PSII.The results showed that all types of PSII have comparable enzyme turnover efficiency. However, the energy gaps on the acceptor side of Chl-d-PSII favor recombination via PD1+Phe- repopulation, leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII. On the other hand, the acceptor-side energy gaps in Chl-f-PSII are tuned to avoid harmful back reactions, favoring resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage.These differences are explained by the redox tuning of the electron transfer cofactors Phe and QA and the number and layout of the chlorophylls that share the excitation energy with the primary electron donor. PSII has adapted to lower energy in two distinct ways, each appropriate for its specific environment but with different functional penalties.
Osteocytes are long-lived, terminally differentiated cells that play crucial roles in maintaining the skeletal system's homeostasis. They regulate bone formation and resorption, bone marrow hematopoiesis, and generate endocrine signals. Osteocytes also regulate the differentiation and interaction of various cell lineages, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In a mouse model, partial ablation of osteocytes using diphtheria toxin subunit α in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)-positive osteocytes led to severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, resulting in shorter lifespan. This osteocyte reduction altered mesenchymal lineage commitment, impairing osteogenesis and inducing osteoclastogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that hematopoietic lineage was mobilized toward myeloid lineage differentiation, with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes, while lymphopoiesis was impaired with reduced B cells. The underlying cause was the acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells. These findings suggest that osteocytes play critical roles in regulation of lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow through mediation of senescence.
The ability of organisms to adapt to new environments through multiple mutational paths can make it challenging to understand the molecular mechanisms behind complex adaptations. In a study using the Escherichia coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) as a model, researchers have investigated how different genomic changes can lead to parallel fitness gains. By analyzing transcriptional and translational changes across 12 replicate populations that have been evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations, they found that all evolved lines have more mRNAs and that this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. Despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations showed remarkably similar gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The majority of expression changes were due to changes at the transcriptional level, with very few translational changes. Additionally, mutations in transcriptional regulators led to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These findings deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.The LTEE is a long-term evolution experiment where 12 replicate populations of E. coli have been adapting in parallel to a carbon-limited medium since 1988. While the replicate populations display similar phenotypic changes, such as increases in fitness and cell size, there is significant diversity at the genomic level. Although few mutations are shared at the nucleotide level, some genes are commonly mutated across evolved lines. However, it was unclear how most of these mutations affect fitness in the system.Researchers hypothesized that similar gene expression patterns might contribute to the parallel increases in fitness in the LTEE. An earlier microarray-based study showed parallel changes in mRNA abundances in two evolved lines at 20,000 generations, but it was unclear which mutations were responsible for these changes and whether the remaining 10 lines also had similar expression profiles. Additionally, protein-coding mRNAs must be translated to perform their function, and the role of hierarchical regulation of gene expression in evolutionary processes has been a subject of debate.To address these questions, the researchers used RNA-seq and Ribo-seq to profile the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes after 22 years (50,000 generations) of evolution in the LTEE. They found that all evolved lines had more mRNAs, and this increase in mRNA abundance scaled with cell size. Despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations showed remarkably similar gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The majority of expression changes were due to changes at the transcriptional level, with very few translational changes. Mutations in transcriptional regulators led to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes.These findings deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution. The results suggest that changes in gene expression at the translational level may buffer, augment, or match changes at the transcriptional level, and that transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in evolution. The researchers also identified specific mutations responsible for parallel changes in gene expression across replicate populations, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms behind these changes. Overall, this study sheds light on the complex interplay between genotype and phenotype in evolution and highlights the importance of considering both transcriptional and translational changes in understanding the adaptive responses of organisms to new environments.Keywords: genetics and genomics, evolutionary biology.
CD133, also known as prominin 1, is a protein widely associated with cancer stem cells and drug resistance. However, new research suggests that during mouse liver regeneration, CD133 is expressed in heterogeneous hepatocytes that manage to divide despite impaired RTK-Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling. These CD133-expressing cells are not other progenitor cell markers and form clusters. This phenomenon is not unique to the liver, as CD133 expression is also upregulated in various cancer cell types following proliferative signal inhibition.Using advanced microscopy techniques, CD133 was found to localize on intracellular vesicles, which the researchers named 'intercellsomes.' These vesicles migrate between cells and are enriched with mRNAs rather than miRNAs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the intracellular diversity of mitogenic mRNAs is lower in Shp2-deficient cells, which may be remedied by intercellular mRNA exchanges between CD133+ cells. CD133-deficient cells are more sensitive to proliferative signal inhibition in livers and intestinal organoids.These findings suggest a mechanism of intercellular communication to compensate for intracellular signal deficits in various cell types. The researchers propose that CD133 plays a role in this process by facilitating the exchange of mRNAs between cells, allowing them to proliferate despite diminished mitogenic signaling. This discovery could have implications for understanding the role of CD133 in cancer and liver regeneration.
Retinal degeneration is a common cause of vision loss and blindness, particularly in individuals with inherited retinal diseases. One such disease, Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) type 10, is caused by mutations in the cilia-centrosomal gene CEP290. This condition can lead to a range of symptoms, including vision loss and damage to other organs. Currently, there are limited treatment options for LCA, and gene therapy is a time-consuming and expensive approach. To identify potential drugs to maintain photoreceptor survival, researchers used retinal organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of rd16 mice, a model of LCA10. They screened over 6,000 bioactive small molecules and identified five non-toxic hits, including the lead molecule reserpine, which maintained photoreceptor development and survival in rd16 organoids. Reserpine also improved photoreceptor survival in LCA10 patient organoids and in the rd16 mouse retina. The researchers found that reserpine modulated signaling pathways related to cell survival/death, metabolism, and proteostasis. Further investigation revealed that autophagy was dysregulated in patient organoids and rd16 mouse retina, and reserpine partially restored the balance between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to improved primary cilium assembly. This study identifies effective drug candidates for CEP290 retinal ciliopathies through cross-species drug discovery using iPSC-derived organoids, highlights the importance of proteostasis in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies, and provides new insights for treatments of retinal neurodegeneration.
Bees play a crucial role in pollinating plants, but they are also exposed to various xenobiotics, including plant metabolites, while foraging for nectar and pollen. Although bees have some enzymes to help metabolize these compounds, their genome has fewer detoxification genes compared to other insects. To survive, bees may rely on their gut microbiota to help degrade potentially toxic molecules. In this study, researchers investigated how the gut microbiota of bees metabolizes amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in honey bee-pollinated almond trees. They found that both bees and their gut microbiota can metabolize amygdalin, but the extent of degradation depends on the presence of the microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, which accumulates in the midgut and hindgut. In contrast, in microbiota-colonized bees, amygdalin is fully degraded into hydrogen cyanide, preventing prunasin accumulation. The researchers identified several strains of bacteria, including Bifidobacterium, Bombilactobacillus, and Gilliamella, that can degrade amygdalin. The degradation mechanism varies between strains, with some producing prunasin as an intermediate. The study also identified a carbohydrate-degrading enzyme, glycoside hydrolase (GH3), in Bifidobacterium wkB204, which fully degrades amygdalin. These findings demonstrate that both the host and microbiota can work together to metabolize dietary plant metabolites, providing important insights into the complex interactions between bees and their microbiome.
Candida albicans is a common fungus that can cause severe infections, particularly invasive candidiasis, which can be life-threatening. One of the virulence factors produced by Candida albicans that contributes to its ability to cause damage to cells is a peptide toxin called candidalysin (CL). CL damages cell membranes, but the mechanism by which it does so is not well understood. In this study, researchers have discovered that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism. They found that CL readily assembles into polymers in solution, and that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer. These oligomers can close into a loop to form a pore. The researchers also identified a mutation in CL (G4W) that inhibits the formation of polymers in solution and prevents pore formation in synthetic lipid systems. Furthermore, they found that CL pores have both simple depressions and more complex structures, which are likely formed by CL assembled in an alternate oligomer orientation. This structural rearrangement may represent a maturation mechanism that stabilizes pore formation to achieve more robust cellular damage. Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanism by which CL damages membranes and identifies CL polymerization as a potential therapeutic target for treating candidiasis.
A study published in the journal PLOS ONE investigated the effect of presenting a placebo analgesia machine as personalized on its effectiveness. The researchers recruited 102 adults and subjected them to painful heat stimulations on their forearm. During half of the stimulations, a machine was presented as delivering an electric current to reduce pain, while in the other half, it was presented as effective in reducing pain generally. Participants told that the machine was personalized reported more relief in pain intensity than the control group in both a feasibility study and a pre-registered double-blind confirmatory study. The study found similar effects on pain unpleasantness, and several personality traits moderated the results. The findings suggest that framing a sham treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness, which could potentially improve the methodology of precision medicine research and inform practice. The study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council and Genome Québec.The precision medicine approach in healthcare tailors interventions to patients' specific genetic, biological, and behavioral markers, leading to better health outcomes. However, it is unclear how much of the improvement is due to the pharmacological personalization versus the non-specific effects of the contextual factors involved in the tailoring process. The influence of contextual factors in precision medicine is relatively unexplored, but research shows that they can directly contribute to better outcomes.The study tested whether presenting a placebo analgesia machine as personalized would increase its effectiveness. Participants in the personalized group reported more relief in pain intensity than the control group, and the findings were similar for pain unpleasantness. Several personality traits, such as interoceptive awareness and openness to experience, moderated the results. The study provides some of the first evidence that framing a sham treatment as personalized increases its effectiveness.The findings could potentially improve the methodology of precision medicine research and inform practice by controlling for contextual factors and optimizing them. The study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council and Genome Québec.Keywords: precision medicine, placebo effect, personalization, pain, psychology, personality traits.
Neurons in the brain and nervous system come from a common ancestor, but their development and connectivity can vary greatly. In mammalian cortex, sister neurons tend to form connections within a shared microcircuit. However, in Drosophila, sister neurons with different levels of Notch expression develop distinct identities and diverge into separate circuits. This phenomenon, where Notch-differentiated sister neurons have distinct connectivity, has been observed in the vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but it's unclear if they integrate into shared or distinct circuits. In this study, researchers investigated how sister V2a (NotchOFF) and V2b (NotchON) neurons in the zebrafish spinal cord integrate into circuits. They found that these sister neurons have similar axonal trajectories and are born from the same Vsx1+ progenitor, but they receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. This is the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.The spinal cord contains motor neurons and interneurons that develop from five progenitor domains. The p2 domain transiently expresses the transcription factor Vsx1, and each p2 progenitor divides into an excitatory V2a (NotchOFF) and an inhibitory V2b (NotchON) neuron. V2a interneurons provide glutamatergic drive to motor populations, while V2b interneurons provide glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition. Despite their shared origin, it was unknown whether these V2a/b sister neurons integrate into shared or distinct functional spinal circuits. The researchers used a sparse labeling approach to directly observe and identify individual pairs of sister V2a/b neurons arising from a single progenitor. Their morphological and electrophysiological analyses revealed that although sister V2a/b neurons share anatomical characteristics, these sister neurons diverge into separate circuits, with largely distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic partners. This is the first assessment of circuit integration of Notch-differentiated clonally related neurons in vertebrate models.
Neurons in the brain work together in networks to process information and respond to changes in their environment. These networks rely on a mechanism called homeostatic plasticity to maintain stable firing rates, allowing them to adapt to perturbations. However, if homeostatic plasticity is activated inappropriately or excessively, it can lead to unintended consequences, such as seizures. The mechanisms that regulate the magnitude of homeostatic plasticity are not well understood. In a recent study, researchers discovered that a family of transcription factors called PARbZIP plays a role in regulating cortical network homeostasis. In the absence of these factors, cortical networks show exaggerated responses to prolonged activity withdrawal, leading to increased excitability and the risk of seizures. The study found that two of the factors, Hlf and Tef, are essential for constraining plasticity and preventing seizures. These findings suggest that transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but also plays a role in limiting the response to activity deprivation.
The development of the respiratory system in mammals begins with the formation of a bud from the embryonic foregut, which eventually grows into the lungs. The tips of the lung bud are lined with epithelial progenitor cells, which are marked by the expression of the genes Sox9 and Id2. These progenitor cells have the ability to generate both airway and alveolar epithelial cells during early development, but later on, they become selective progenitors of alveolar epithelial cells. The development and differentiation of these progenitor cells are controlled by complex gene regulatory networks involving transcription factors such as Sox9, Etv5, Irx, Mycn, and Foxp1/2. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these transcription factors and other signaling pathways control chromatin state to establish and maintain cell-type identity are not well understood.To gain insights into the regulatory networks controlling the development of SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cells, researchers analyzed gene expression (RNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) data from these cells during embryonic development in Mus musculus. They observed widespread changes in chromatin accessibility between E11.5 and E16.5, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers. Genetic network inference identified a common SOX9+ progenitor gene regulatory network, implicating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+ progenitor cells. Consistent with this model, conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mouse resulted in an expansion of the SOX9+ EPC population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation. These findings demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis and highlight the combinatorial power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development.In summary, the development of the respiratory system involves the formation of epithelial progenitor cells, which give rise to all types of lung epithelial cells. The development and differentiation of these progenitor cells are controlled by complex gene regulatory networks involving transcription factors and signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these factors control chromatin state to establish and maintain cell-type identity are not well understood. Recent advances in epigenomic analysis, such as RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq, have provided new insights into the regulatory networks controlling lung epithelial development. In this study, researchers used these techniques to define the chromatin accessibility landscape of developing SOX9+ lung epithelial progenitor cells and identified a common SOX9+ progenitor gene regulatory network, implicating PI3K signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+ progenitor cells. These findings demonstrate the power of epigenomic analysis to identify new roles for gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways in lung epithelial development and highlight the previously unappreciated role of PI3K signaling in SOX9+ cell differentiation and proximal-distal cell fate specification.
Working memory (WM) is a crucial cognitive function that allows us to temporarily store and manipulate information. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder that affects WM, particularly in its early stages. Traditionally, WM has been studied using the binary slot model, which assumes that information is stored in a limited number of slots and can only be recalled if it is currently in one of those slots. However, recent studies using continuous reproduction paradigms suggest that WM resources are dynamically allocated, and this model provides new insights into the organization of the WM system. In this study, the authors investigated WM dysfunction in MS using two continuous reproduction paradigms: memory-guided localization (MGL) and an analog recall task with sequential presentation. The results showed that both recall error and precision were impaired in MS, with MGL being more accurate in distinguishing MS subtypes and sequential paradigms being better in distinguishing healthy controls from relapsing-remitting MS. The computational modeling of the results from the sequential paradigm determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error (mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items) were responsible for WM dysfunction in MS. Overall, this study offers a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficits and provides new insights into the organization of the WM system in the MS population.
Nociception is the neural process that helps animals avoid tissue damage by detecting painful stimuli. While the peripheral mechanisms of nociception are well-conserved across the animal kingdom, it is unclear whether the brain's ability to modulate nociception is also conserved in non-mammalian species. In this study, researchers investigated the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which has a neural system similar to mammals in many ways, including a neuropeptide called Drosulfakinin (DSK) that is homologous to mammalian cholecystokinin (CCK), a key player in mammalian descending control of nociception. The researchers found that DSK mutants are hypersensitive to noxious heat and that DSK signaling inhibits nociception through a descending neuronal pathway. This is the first evidence of a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species, suggesting that this is an ancient mechanism for regulating nociception.
Plants produce various secondary metabolites as a defense mechanism against parasitic fungi. However, some fungi have developed ways to overcome these defenses. In a recent study, researchers discovered a fungus that resists the toxic effects of rocaglates, a group of antifungal compounds produced by the Aglaia plant. The researchers found that this fungus belongs to the Ophiocordyceps genus and has a mutation in its eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4A, which is the molecular target of rocaglates. The mutation in eIF4A prevents rocaglates from binding, allowing the fungus to survive on Aglaia plants. The researchers also used ribosome profiling to demonstrate that the translational inhibitory effects of rocaglates were largely attenuated in the engineered fungus. This study highlights the ongoing arms race between plants and fungi in the production and resistance to secondary metabolites.
Psychophysics is a crucial method used in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience to measure the relationship between external stimuli and internal sensations. It involves controlled experiments and rigorous analysis using signal detection theory (SDT). However, traditional psychophysical methods can be tedious and time-consuming, leading to low participant engagement and increased variability. A newer approach, called continuous psychophysics, allows for continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli, but its analysis methods have not been able to fully account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task.In this study, the authors introduce a computational analysis framework for continuous psychophysics based on Bayesian inverse optimal control. They show through simulations and previously published data that this approach not only recovers perceptual thresholds but also estimates subjects' action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics.The authors argue that it's important to consider acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and the intrinsic costs of behavior, even in experiments that seem to only investigate perception. They demonstrate that a model that only considers the perceptual side of the task will tend to overestimate perceptual uncertainty because additional factors, such as motor control and subjective costs, get lumped into perceptual model parameters.The authors propose using the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework, which accommodates continuous states and actions under linear dynamics and Gaussian variability, to model sequential perception and actions under sensory uncertainty, action variability, and explicitly include behavioral costs. This approach can accommodate task goals beyond estimation as well as physiological and cognitive costs of performing actions.The authors apply their method to data from three previously published experiments and show that it explains the data better than models only considering perceptual contributions to behavioral data. The method also provides inferences of subjects' action variability, subjective behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about stimulus dynamics. Overall, the authors argue that their approach improves current analyses and should be the preferred analysis technique for continuous psychophysics paradigms.Keywords: psychophysics, continuous psychophysics, Bayesian inverse optimal control, Bayesian decision theory, signal detection theory, perception, cognition, neuroscience, motor control, behavioral economics, optimal control under uncertainty, partially observable Markov decision processes, linear quadratic Gaussian framework, subjective costs, subjective beliefs, acting uncertainties.
Decision-making is a complex process that involves evaluating evidence and committing to an option based on that evidence. Traditional models of decision-making have focused on normative principles, assuming that decisions are based on fixed thresholds or urgency-gated rules. However, these models have limitations when it comes to understanding decisions made under dynamic conditions, where evidence quality or reward can change during a single decision. In a new study, researchers derived a normative model for decisions based on changing contexts, which allows for adaptive thresholds that respond to and even anticipate these changes. The study showed that these adaptive thresholds exhibit distinct temporal motifs depending on the specific context changes and that they perform robustly even when implemented imperfectly. The results of this study provide new insights into the behavioral relevance of adaptive decision thresholds in dynamic environments and link normative and neural decision-making as dynamic, adaptive processes.The researchers used Bellman's equation to identify decision strategies that maximize trial-averaged reward rate when conditions can change during decision deliberation. They found that for simple tasks with sudden, expected within-trial changes in reward or evidence quality, these normative decision strategies involve non-trivial, time-dependent changes in decision thresholds. These rules take several different forms that outperform their heuristic counterparts and have performance that is robust to noisy implementations. The study also showed that these normative, adaptive threshold models provide a better account of human behavior on a 'tokens task,' where the value of commitment changes gradually at predictable times and the quality of evidence changes unpredictably within each trial. Overall, this research offers new insights into the behavioral relevance of adaptive decision thresholds in dynamic environments and highlights the importance of considering the specific context changes when modeling decision-making.
Biodiversity, which includes all the different types of plants, animals, and microorganisms in an ecosystem, is essential for the health and functioning of our planet. However, biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate due to human activities such as agriculture, climate change, and pollution. Freshwater ecosystems, including lakes and ponds, have experienced the greatest biodiversity loss. To better understand the causes of biodiversity loss and its impact on ecosystem functions, scientists have developed a new conceptual framework using artificial intelligence. In this study, researchers applied this framework to a freshwater ecosystem, Lake Ring in Denmark, which has a well-documented history of human impact over the past 100 years. They used multilocus metabarcoding and mass spectrometry analysis to measure community-level functional biodiversity and identified correlations with biocides and climate change records. The results showed that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed over time and did not return to its original state, even after partial recovery. Insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. This approach, which uses high-throughput systemic methods to study long-term trends, can help identify the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions. The study advocates for the use of this approach to inform conservation efforts and mitigate the negative impacts of human activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services.
The brain's ability to keep up with the constantly changing world is crucial for survival. However, the brain receives outdated sensory information due to the time it takes for neural transmission and processing. In the field of motion perception, the brain may overcome these delays by predicting the position of moving objects based on their past trajectories. A recent study used high temporal resolution electroencephalographic data to evaluate this proposition. The researchers tracked neural position representations of moving objects at different stages of visual processing and found that during early stimulus-evoked activity, position representations of moving objects were activated earlier than those evoked by unpredictable flashes. This suggests that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for neural delays in early processing stages, but delays still accumulate across later stages of cortical processing.
A recent study investigated how language experience affects the neural representation of semantic knowledge in the human brain, specifically in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL), using a unique group of early deaf adults. The study compared two groups of deaf adults: those with reduced early language exposure and those who acquired sign language from birth. The results showed that the group with reduced early language exposure had reduced semantic sensitivity, both in multivariate pattern and univariate analyses, in the left dATL compared to the control group. This suggests that language experience plays a role in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences. The findings highlight the importance of language in shaping the neural basis of semantic knowledge.
The hippocampus, a part of the brain, plays a crucial role in forming and consolidating memories. Hippocampal place cells, which are activated by an animal's position in an environment, have been studied extensively in the context of memory processing. During behavior, place cells' firing rate and position in the environment (place representation) are used to encode information about an episode. During offline periods, such as sleep, place cells reactivate in a sequential pattern, a phenomenon called replay. Replay has been primarily defined by the sequential activation of place fields, but recent research suggests that place cells' firing rate (rate representation) may also be important during replay. In a new study, researchers found that dorsal CA1 place cells in rats can modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts, independent of place information. This experience-dependent phenomenon can be used to discriminate between contexts, suggesting that there are two complementary neural representations available for memory processes. This finding challenges the current understanding of hippocampal replay and highlights the importance of considering both place and rate representations in understanding memory encoding and consolidation.
Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders that can lead to impaired spermatogenesis and male infertility, but the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions are not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated the role of PARL, a mitochondrial intra-membrane rhomboid protease, in spermatogenesis using PARL-deficient mice. They found that these mice develop early testicular atrophy due to a complete arrest of spermatogenesis during meiotic prophase I, followed by degeneration and death of arrested spermatocytes. This process is independent of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, genetic modifications of PINK1, PGAM5, and TTC19, three major substrates of PARL with important roles in mitochondrial homeostasis, did not reproduce or modify this severe phenotype. The researchers observed severe abnormalities in mitochondrial ultrastructure in PARL-deficient spermatocytes, along with prominent electron transfer chain defects, disrupted CoQ biosynthesis, and metabolic rewiring. These mitochondrial defects were associated with a germ cell-specific decrease in GPX4 expression, leading to arrested spermatocytes undergoing ferroptosis, a regulated cell death modality characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. The findings suggest that mitochondrial defects induced by PARL depletion act as an initiating trigger for ferroptosis in primary spermatocytes through simultaneous effects on GPX4 and CoQ, two major inhibitors of ferroptosis. These results provide new insights into the potential role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and male infertility, warranting further investigation.
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that has been studied for its potential role in treating type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). While the effects of FGF21 on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity are well-known, the mechanisms by which it protects the liver from injury and damage in NASH have not been fully understood. In this study, researchers used a mouse model called APOE*3-Leiden . CETP to investigate the protective effects of FGF21 on NASH. They found that overexpressing FGF21 in the liver prevented liver injury, as evidenced by a decrease in hepatic lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrosis. FGF21 blocked hepatic lipid influx and accumulation through endocrine and autocrine signaling, respectively, which prevented Kupffer cell (KC) activation and reduced the presence of lipid- and scar-associated macrophages, thereby inhibiting fibrogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that hepatic FGF21 overexpression limits hepatic lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrogenesis by blocking hepatic lipid influx and accumulation and preventing KC activation and monocyte recruitment.
Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, which is crucial for understanding the functioning of the brain and the nervous system in various species, from flies to humans. However, the vast diversity of neurophysiological experiments and data makes it challenging to integrate, reproduce, and reuse data across different modalities and species. To address this issue, researchers have developed a standard language for neurophysiology data called Neurodata Without Borders (NWB). NWB is an open-source software that defines and modularizes the interdependent components of a data language, enabling the unified description of neurophysiology data across diverse modalities and species. NWB exists in an ecosystem that includes data management, analysis, visualization, and archive tools, making it possible to reproduce, interchange, and reuse diverse neurophysiology data. The design principles of NWB are applicable to enhancing discovery across biology through data FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). NWB's impact is demonstrated by its ability to describe neurophysiology data from various modalities and species, including sensation, perception, cognition, and action, using tasks such as running on balls, memory-guided navigation of mazes, production of speech, and memory formation. NWB is also used for intracellular functioning of single neurons, detailed workings of neural circuits, and human epilepsy patients. The NWB data language is essential for creating a robust data and analysis ecosystem, empowering users to integrate software components and products from across the ecosystem to address complex scientific challenges. NWB is now utilized by over 53 labs and research organizations, making neurophysiology data FAIR. The processes and principles used to create NWB provide an exemplar for biological data ecosystems more broadly.
Influenza A virus (IAV) is known to cause respiratory symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, and excessive sleepiness. However, severe respiratory infections can lead to long-lasting neurological disturbances, including encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. The mechanisms behind these neurological changes are not well understood. In this study, researchers infected mice with H1N1 IAV and analyzed the brain at different time points using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the hypothalamus. The results showed that all identified cell populations in the hypothalamus experienced transcriptional changes, with the most pronounced response occurring three days after infection. The immune response was mainly impacted in microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, which showed increased numbers of cells expressing pro-inflammatory gene networks. Most neuronal cell populations downregulated genes contributing to energy homeostasis in mitochondria and protein translation in the cytosol, suggesting a potential reduction in cellular and neuronal activity. This could be a preventive mechanism to avoid intracellular viral replication and attack by phagocytosing cells. The change in microglia gene activity suggests a shift in microglia activity to provide increased surveillance of their surroundings. The hypothalamus, a central regulator of homeostasis during a viral challenge, was chosen for this study as it plays a role in regulating various physiological and behavioral functions. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) were specifically analyzed, as they contain specialized neuron populations that control feeding, body temperature, sleep-wake states, and circadian rhythms. The study found that all non-neuronal cell types returned to their resting state after recovery, while neurons showed long-lasting changes in their transcriptome. These findings provide insight into the molecular changes during an IAV infection and may help explain the neurological disturbances observed in humans.
Apicobasal cell polarity is crucial for maintaining tissue structure and preventing tumorigenesis in epithelial tissues. However, the link between polarity loss and plasticity, which is a key event in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorigenesis, is not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, researchers conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on Drosophila ovaries, where polarity-gene Lgl knockdown (Lgl-KD) causes invasive multilayering of follicular epithelia. They discovered that cells in the multilayered follicles displayed distinct gene expression profiles and identified a genetic requirement for Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in promoting multilayer formation of Lgl-KD cells. Ectopic expression of Keap1 increased the volume of delaminated follicle cells and enhanced their invasive behavior, with significant changes to the cytoskeleton. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptome of cells within the follicle cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and reveals a new link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity during early tumorigenesis.
Humans learn about the world around them through both direct interaction and social sources, such as observing others. The confidence in the information obtained from these sources can impact how we adapt and change our behavior. In a recent study, researchers compared how humans process information from social and non-social sources during learning tasks. They found that confidence judgments about social sources were more accurate and less changeable than those about non-social sources. Additionally, brain activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction more closely tracked confidence about social sources. The study suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying social learning may be partially distinct from those involved in non-social learning.The researchers used a controlled experimental design, with two sessions that were statistically similar but differed in their framing as social or non-social. Participants were asked to judge the precision of predictions made by social (advice) and non-social (cues) sources. Over time, participants formed estimates of how confident they were in each source's predictions. The results showed that humans are more certain in the performance accuracy of social predictors compared to non-social predictors. This was evident in the stability of confidence judgments across multiple timescales in the social condition and a stronger reliance on past representations and weaker integration of new contradictory evidence.Two brain areas, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction, showed specificity in their processing of social information, not only in their average activation but also in their multivariate pattern of activation. These findings suggest that social learning may involve distinct neural mechanisms compared to non-social learning.The study provides insights into the behavioral and neural computations that differentiate learning from social and non-social sources and contributes to the ongoing debate about the degree to which social and non-social cognitive functions are distinct. The results highlight the importance of considering the nature of the information source when studying learning and the role of confidence in shaping our behavior.Keywords: social learning, non-social learning, confidence, neural mechanisms, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior temporoparietal junction.
Synaptic communication between neurons relies on the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles, which is triggered by calcium ions (Ca2+) entering the cell. This process, called exocytosis, must occur with high sensitivity to the brief and localized calcium signals in order to facilitate fast neurotransmission. The protein synaptotagmin is responsible for conferring calcium sensitivity to neurotransmitter release, but its mechanism of action has been unclear due to biochemical measurements suggesting low calcium affinity.New research suggests that synaptotagmin's calcium sensitivity is enhanced when it binds to a specific phospholipid, PI(4,5)P2, in the plasma membrane. This binding stabilizes the calcium/PI(4,5)P2 dual-bound state, which lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion and enables the synchronized engagement of multiple synaptotagmins for fast exocytosis.The researchers developed a mathematical model based on this positive allosteric stabilization and the assumption that the effect of multiple synaptotagmins on the energy barrier is additive. The model reproduces the steep calcium dependency of neurotransmitter release and suggests that each synaptotagmin lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by approximately 5 kBT.The study also shows that mutations affecting synaptotagmin's allosteric properties may cause dominant-negative effects, even though synaptotagmins act independently on the energy barrier. Additionally, dynamic changes in local PI(4,5)P2 availability, such as those induced by vesicle movement, can significantly impact synaptic responses.Overall, the findings suggest that allosterically stabilized calcium/PI(4,5)P2 dual binding to the C2B domain is the molecular basis for synaptotagmins' cooperative control of neurotransmitter release. This understanding could lead to new insights into the mechanisms of neurotransmission and the development of potential therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders.
Sauropterygians were a diverse group of Mesozoic marine reptiles that lived from the Early Triassic to the Late Cretaceous period. These reptiles, which include the iconic plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, have long been of interest to scientists due to their unique body plans and adaptations to the marine environment. However, the early evolutionary history of sauropterygians and their relationships with other diapsid reptiles are still not fully understood.In a new study, researchers have discovered a new saurosphargid, a type of armored marine reptile, from the Early Triassic of South China. This discovery, named Prosaurosphargis yingzishanensis, is the earliest known occurrence of the saurosphargid clade.The researchers also conducted an updated phylogenetic analysis of diapsid reptiles, which recovered saurosphargids as nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. This finding challenges the traditional classification of sauropterygians into two distinct groups, the short-necked, durophagous placodonts and the long-necked eosauropterygians.The study also clarified the phylogenetic position of several Early and Middle Triassic sauropterygians, such as Atopodentatus, Hanosaurus, Majiashanosaurus, and Corosaurus, which have previously been of uncertain phylogenetic affinity.The findings provide important insights into the early evolution of sauropterygians and their relationships with other diapsid reptiles, emphasizing the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa. The study also supports the placement of testudines and archosauromorphs within Archelosauria, a result that has been previously suggested based on molecular data but only recently recovered in a morphology-only analysis.
Smoking is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, and its impact on DNA methylation levels has been extensively studied through epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). However, it is unclear whether smoking-associated methylation changes are due to smoking itself or a shared genetic predisposition to both smoking and methylation levels. To address this question, researchers analyzed DNA methylation data from 769 monozygotic twin pairs, including those discordant for current or former smoking. They found that 13 differentially methylated CpG sites were present in current smoking twins compared to their genetically identical co-twins who never smoked. These sites were located in genes encoding subunits of a calcium voltage-gated channel and G protein, which interact with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, suggesting that methylation levels at these CpGs might be reactive to nicotine exposure. Furthermore, methylation patterns in monozygotic twins discordant for former smoking indicated that these changes were largely reversible upon smoking cessation. The study also showed that differences in smoking level exposure between monozygotic twins who are both current smokers but differ in the number of cigarettes they smoke were reflected in their DNA methylation profiles. Overall, this study provides robust evidence that DNA methylation levels in human blood cells are reactive to cigarette smoking. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying smoking-associated diseases and the addictive effects of smoking.
The retina, a crucial part of the visual system, has been extensively studied in isolation, but its function in living animals, particularly when they are awake, remains a mystery. To better understand this, researchers conducted single-unit recordings in the optic tract of head-fixed mice to compare the output of awake, anesthetized, and ex-vivo retinas. While the visual response properties were generally similar across conditions, awake retinal output had faster response kinetics with less variability, a larger dynamic range, and higher firing activity. Modeling analyses showed that these awake response patterns convey comparable total information but less efficiently, allowing for a linear population decoder to perform significantly better than anesthetized or ex-vivo responses. These findings suggest that the retina employs dense coding in vivo, rather than the sparse efficient coding assumed from ex-vivo studies. The retina is the first stage of the visual pathway and its function is crucial for understanding how visual information is processed and transmitted to the brain. While ex-vivo studies have provided valuable insights, they have limitations, such as the inability to perform long-term recordings or study neuromodulatory effects. In vivo studies are essential for translating our knowledge from ex-vivo to fully physiological in vivo conditions and clarifying retinal function. Previous in vivo studies were mostly conducted under anesthetized conditions, but recent attention has been paid to the roles of an animal's behavior and internal brain states in the function of the sensory systems. Our study employed single-unit extracellular recording techniques from head-fixed mice to examine the visual responses to a set of widely used visual stimuli in the optic tract, a bundle of nerve fibers composed of RGC axons as they project from the eye to their main targets: the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and superior colliculus (SC). These recordings are superior to direct in vivo retinal recordings or extracellular recordings in SC or dLGN because the retinal circuits and the eye optics remain intact, and RGC axonal signals do not need to be disambiguated from those of local axons or somata. From our OT recordings, we found that the temporal dynamics of the retinal outputs were slower in anesthetized conditions, and the retinal outputs in awake conditions had higher baseline firing rates and a larger dynamic range. These findings challenge the sparse efficient coding and minimum energy principles that have been used as a model of early visual processing. Instead, we suggest that the retina may employ dense coding principles in vivo.
 Paraformaldehyde (PFA) is a widely used fixative in various biological techniques to preserve cellular structures and biomolecular interactions. However, its effect on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a phenomenon observed in living cells, is not well understood. In this study, researchers compared images of cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins known to undergo LLPS before and after PFA fixation. Surprisingly, they found that fixation can both enhance and diminish the appearance of LLPS behaviors. For certain proteins, fixation can even cause artificial puncta to appear in cells that do not have any detectable puncta in the live condition. The addition of glycine, a molecule that modulates fixation rates, can reverse the fixation effect from enhancing to diminishing LLPS appearance. The researchers also developed a kinetic model of fixation and simulations suggest that protein localization in fixed cells depends on the balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and the difference in fixation rates of different proteins. These findings highlight the importance of considering the complex interplay between protein-protein interactions and fixation rates when interpreting results from fixed-cell imaging techniques. The study also underscores the need for caution when using immunofluorescence imaging of fixed cells as evidence of LLPS in vivo.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and can lead to recurring infections despite antibiotic treatment. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) forms intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) within the bladder's superficial umbrella cells during early stages of UTIs. Understanding the dynamic responses of IBCs to host stresses and antibiotic therapy is crucial for developing effective treatments. However, it's challenging to study these responses in situ. To address this, researchers have developed a human bladder-chip model that co-cultures umbrella cells and bladder microvascular endothelial cells under flow in urine and nutritive media, respectively. This model allows for bladder filling and voiding to be mimicked mechanically, enabling the observation of neutrophil recruitment, swarm formation, and bacterial growth dynamics within individual IBCs. The study revealed that neutrophils form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) but do not prevent IBC formation. During recovery periods, bacteria within IBCs rapidly proliferate and reseed new foci of infection through bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation. These findings highlight the importance of IBCs as harbors of bacterial persistence and suggest that strategies aimed at eradicating IBCs are crucial for effective treatment.
Ammonium (NH4+) is a crucial component of life, serving as the foundation for the synthesis of nitrogenous building blocks. The process of assimilating ammonium into cells typically occurs through two main pathways: one that produces glutamate directly, and another that converts glutamate into glutamine, which then donates its amine group to other molecules. This intricate network of reactions allows for the conversion of various amino acids into glutamate or the removal of amines from transamination reactions. In a recent study, researchers investigated the flexibility of this network by creating an Escherichia coli strain that was auxotrophic for glutamate. Through this strain, they identified several amino acids, including aspartate, β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine, that could complement the auxotrophy by producing glutamate or serving as new amine sources. The researchers also identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase (DadA) as an intracellular amino acid sink that removes substrates from transamination reactions. Furthermore, they introduced ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine. This study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.
Corals, which build the beautiful and diverse structures of reefs, rely on symbiotic algae for their survival. These algae, known as Symbiodiniaceae, live inside the coral cells in a specialized organelle called the symbiosome. The algae provide the coral with energy through photosynthesis, but it is unclear how this energy is transferred to the coral. In this study, researchers investigated how the algal symbiont, Breviolum sp., responds to low pH conditions, which are common in coral reef environments. They found that under low pH conditions, the alga releases more glucose and galactose, or monosaccharides, into the environment. The cell surface structures of the alga were deformed, and genes related to cellulase were upregulated. Importantly, the release of monosaccharides was blocked when the researchers added a cellulase inhibitor, suggesting that the cellulose cell wall of the alga is broken down, releasing the sugars. These findings suggest that the low pH environment triggers the cellulase-mediated release of monosaccharides from the algal cell wall as a response to the coral reef ecosystem. This discovery could help explain how the coral receives energy from its symbiotic algae.
Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a rare genetic disorder that causes kidney cysts and fibrosis, leading to end-stage renal disease in children and young adults. There is currently no targeted therapy available for this condition. Invs, one of the over 25 NPHP genes identified, is responsible for the development of renal fibrosis and cysts when the entire gene is knocked out in mice. However, the specific roles of different cell types and the relationship between epithelial cysts and interstitial fibrosis are not well understood. In this study, researchers generated and characterized cell-type-specific knockout mouse models of Invs, investigated the impact of removing cilia on phenotype severity, and evaluated the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) on Invs mutants.Epithelial-specific knockout of Invs in Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre mutant mice resulted in renal cyst formation and severe stromal fibrosis. In contrast, Invsflox/flox;Foxd1-Cre mice, where Invs is deleted in stromal cells, displayed no observable phenotypes up to the young adult stage. These findings highlight the importance of epithelial-stromal crosstalk in NPHP.Furthermore, increased cell proliferation and myofibroblast activation occurred early during disease progression and preceded detectable cyst formation in the Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre kidney. Concomitant removal of cilia partially suppressed the phenotypes of the Invsflox/flox;Cdh16-Cre mutant kidney, supporting a significant interaction of cilia and Invs function in vivo. Finally, VPA reduced cyst burden, decreased cell proliferation, and ameliorated kidney function decline in Invs mutant mice.These results reveal the critical role of renal epithelial cilia in NPHP and suggest the possibility of repurposing VPA for NPHP treatment.
The Steller's sea cow, a now-extinct marine mammal that lived in the North Pacific, was well adapted to the harsh coastal climate. However, little is known about the physiological adjustments that allowed it to thrive in this environment. In this study, researchers investigated the adult-expressed hemoglobin (Hb) of the Steller's sea cow and found a fixed amino acid replacement that significantly affects Hb function. This replacement, β/δ82Lys→Asn, reduces the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of the Hb protein and makes it unresponsive to the allosteric effector 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), a first among mammals. This change likely contributed to the secondary evolution of a reduced blood-O2 affinity phenotype, which would have promoted heightened tissue and maternal/fetal O2 delivery. The study also revealed that the Steller's sea cow had unique replacements in its embryonic Hb proteins, Hb Gower I (ζ2ε2) and HbF (α2γ2), which increased their O2 affinity relative to dugong HbF. Additionally, the β/δ82Lys→Asn replacement increases protein solubility, potentially elevating red blood cell Hb content within both the adult and fetal circulations, contributing to meeting the elevated metabolic requirements and fetal growth rates associated with this species' cold adaptation. Overall, this research provides insights into the evolution of Hb function in the Steller's sea cow and its adaptation to the sub-Arctic environment.
Researchers have developed a new method to create continuous cell lines from Drosophila fruit flies using the activated Ras gene, RasV12. This technique simplifies the generation of cell lines from various cell types, including muscle, glial, epithelial, neuronal, and hemocyte. The researchers used lineage-restricted RasV12 expression to create these cell lines and found that differentiation with the hormone ecdysone caused maturation of cells from mesoderm lines into active muscle tissue and enhanced dendritic features in neuronal-like lines. Transcriptome analysis confirmed the expression of key cell-type-specific genes and the expected alignment with single-cell sequencing and in situ data. The resulting cells and associated data are available from the Drosophila Genomic Resource Center. This method has the potential to provide valuable in vitro models for various cell types, which could be useful for high-throughput and biochemical approaches.
Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are specialized epithelial cells that line various surfaces in the body and produce multiple motile cilia to promote fluid flow. During their development, MCCs undergo a process called centriole amplification, which involves a dramatic expansion of their centriole content. The protein Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is known to be essential for centriole duplication in cycling cells, but its role in centriole assembly in MCCs has been debated. To clarify this discrepancy, researchers created genetically engineered mouse models and found that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are crucial for centriole amplification in MCCs. Without centriole amplification, MCCs accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and fail to expand their apical surface area. These findings suggest that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs, and that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events.
The endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus, undergoes a monthly cycle of tissue damage and repair. During menstruation, the surface epithelium sheds, and the tissue rapidly regenerates. The mechanisms behind this rapid repair process are not well understood. In this study, researchers used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic lines of mice to investigate the origins of epithelial cells that become part of the newly formed luminal epithelium. They identified a new population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that develop a unique transcriptomic signature during endometrial breakdown and repair. These cells appear to be in transition from stromal fibroblasts to epithelial cells. The researchers confirmed this hypothesis by using a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts and stromal perivascular cells. They found that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition and become incorporated into the re-epithelialized luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings provide a foundation for further research into endometrial pathologies and other mucosal tissues that respond differently to wounding.
Bacteria, like other organisms, need to adapt to changing environmental conditions to survive. One way they achieve this is through phase variation, a mechanism that generates genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity within a population. In the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis, researchers have identified a phase variation system that duplicates a 208.6 kb region of DNA containing 157 coding sequences through RecA-mediated homologous recombination. This system allows for a variable copy number of the region within populations, which is advantageous for growth in different conditions. While insertion sequence (IS) elements are known to contribute to evolution through gene inactivation and altering genomic architecture, this system represents a rare example of IS elements providing homologous sequences for amplification of a chromosomal region that provides a selective advantage. The presence of multiple copies of the region enhances growth in biofilms, while a single copy is advantageous during planktonic growth. This system expands the lifestyle repertoire of the species by providing flexibility in response to environmental changes.
The process of protein synthesis, or translation, is crucial for the survival of all living organisms. It involves the decoding of genetic information in messenger RNA (mRNA) by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. The translation process is complex and involves many components, some of which are redundant. Redundancy in the translation machinery is thought to have evolved under selection, driven by its impact on growth rate. However, the costs and benefits of redundancy, as well as the organization of this redundancy across different components, are not well understood.To investigate this, researchers manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of Escherichia coli by deleting 28 tRNA genes, 3 tRNA modifying systems, and 4 rRNA operons in various combinations. They found that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful but costly under nutrient limitation. This nutrient-dependent cost of redundant tRNA genes stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. These effects are also contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing.The results suggest that both positive and negative selection acts on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species' evolutionary history with feasts and famines. The findings provide new insights into the evolution of a highly redundant translation apparatus.Keywords: translation, redundancy, tRNA, rRNA, Escherichia coli, evolution, selection, growth rate.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented amount of genomic data being generated from SARS-CoV-2 sequences. This data is crucial for understanding the evolution of the virus and identifying transmission events and new variants. However, existing tools for exploring phylogenetic trees, which represent the evolutionary history of the virus, do not scale to the size of the SARS-CoV-2 dataset. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a new tool called Taxonium. Taxonium uses WebGL technology to allow the exploration of trees with millions of nodes in the browser for the first time. It can be run entirely locally, from a server-based backend, or as a desktop application. Taxonium links each node to associated metadata and supports mutation-annotated trees, which capture all known genetic variation in a dataset. Analyzing a tree of five million sequences can provide valuable insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution, such as identifying recurrent mutations and transmission events. Taxonium is available at cov2tree.org and can be applied to any tree. It is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium. Taxonium can help researchers gain a better understanding of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and can be used to explore other large trees as well.
RNA molecules are transported to specific subcellular locations through interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). While we have a good understanding of the mechanisms behind RNA localization in a particular cell type, it is unclear how these mechanisms apply to other cell types with vastly different morphologies. In a recent study, researchers used a technique called Halo-seq to investigate the transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells. They found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RP mRNAs) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. The researchers identified a pyrimidine-rich motif in the 5' UTRs of RP mRNAs that was sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also found to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. This localization was dependent on the RNA-binding protein LARP1 and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-1. The researchers also compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells and found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs. These findings suggest that RNA localization mechanisms may be conserved across different cell types and morphologies. This is the first time an RNA element has been identified that regulates RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, and it establishes LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator. Overall, these findings demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms are more widespread than previously thought and provide insights into the molecular basis of RNA localization in different cell types.
 In recent years, there have been numerous claims that aging is associated with an increase in transcriptional noise in cells and tissues. However, the methods used to measure this phenomenon have varied widely, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. To address this issue, researchers have developed Decibel, a Python toolkit that implements four commonly used methods for quantifying age-related transcriptional noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. They also introduced a new method called Scallop for quantifying the membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster, with cells having a higher Scallop membership score being more transcriptionally stable. The researchers applied these tools to seven aging datasets and found significant variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging. Instead, they found consistent age-associated changes in cell type composition, particularly of immune cells. These results challenge the assumption that increased transcriptional noise is a fundamental property of aging and suggest that claims of such a phenomenon should be reevaluated. The researchers also emphasize the importance of considering both transcriptional noise and cell type composition when studying aging.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer that is particularly challenging to treat due to its heterogeneous nature, with some tumors developing resistance to therapy. Identifying the characteristics of these resistant clonal lineages is crucial for developing effective treatments. In this study, researchers used a technique called WILD-seq (Wholistic Interrogation of Lineage Dynamics by sequencing) to analyze the response and resistance to therapy in mouse models of TNBC. This method, which combines clonal transcriptomics and lineage tracing, revealed that oxidative stress protection by NRF2 is a major mechanism of taxane resistance. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that their tumor models are sensitive to asparagine deprivation therapy using the clinical stage drug L-asparaginase after initial treatment with docetaxel. Overall, WILD-seq provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy and identifies asparagine bioavailability as a potential vulnerability of taxane-resistant lineages. This discovery could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for TNBC patients.Introduction:Tumor heterogeneity, or the presence of diverse clonal lineages within a tumor, is a significant barrier to successful cancer treatment. While bulk sequencing has revealed the extent of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and the role of rare resistant clones in driving relapse, it is limited in its ability to characterize these clones and how their properties change over time and in response to therapy. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the simultaneous analysis of clonal identity and gene expression, but these methods have primarily been used in vitro or for studying metastatic dissemination in vivo. A thorough understanding of the biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy is essential for improving patient outcomes. While many existing combination cancer therapies are not rationally designed, newer strategies such as synthetic lethality, drug synergy, and collateral sensitivity aim to leverage selective vulnerabilities of tumor cells while minimizing toxicity. Collateral sensitivity, in which a tumor becomes resistant to one drug but sensitive to a second drug, is of particular promise. Identifying frontline therapy-induced collateral sensitivities to second-line therapy could lead to improved outcomes for patients. Here, we describe WILD-seq (Wholistic Interrogation of Lineage Dynamics by sequencing), an accessible and adaptable platform for lineage tracing at the single-cell transcriptomic level, and apply it to the study of syngeneic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models.Methods:The researchers used WILD-seq to analyze the response of TNBC models to frontline taxane-based chemotherapy. They optimized their pipeline to ensure recurrent representation of clonal lineages across animals and samples, facilitating analysis of clonal dynamics under the selective pressure of therapeutic intervention.Results:The analysis of TNBC models revealed an enrichment of clones with high levels of NRF2 signaling, implicating defense against oxidative damage as a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. Building on the work of others, the researchers showed that these NRF2-high, taxane-resistant lineages are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation as a result of L-asparaginase treatment. They also found that these cells adapt to this second-line intervention by up-regulating de novo asparagine synthesis by increasing asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression.Conclusion:These data indicate that high levels of NRF2 signaling, which is also observed in patients following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, promotes both resistance to chemotherapy and sensitivity to asparagine deprivation. The researchers suggest that L-asparaginase could be explored as a therapeutic modality in solid tumors.Keywords:chromosomes and gene expression, cancer biology.
DMRT1 is a gene that is widely known as the testis-determining factor in various species of vertebrates, but its role in mammalian testes differentiation is ambiguous. Previous studies have shown that loss of DMRT1 function leads to different phenotypes in men and mice, including Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) and male infertility. To further understand DMRT1's role in mammals, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 to abolish its expression in rabbits. They found that gonads from XY DMRT1-deficient rabbit fetuses differentiated like ovaries, indicating that DMRT1 is involved in testis determination. In addition, DMRT1 is required in the supporting cells to increase the expression of the SOX9 gene, which heads the testicular genetic cascade. Furthermore, XX and XY DMRT1-deficient ovaries did not undergo meiosis and folliculogenesis, and adult females were sterile. These findings suggest that DMRT1 is also crucial for female fertility. The results of this study support the potential involvement of DMRT1 mutations in various human pathologies, including DSD and infertility. The data also indicate an evolutionary continuum between non-mammalian vertebrates and non-rodent mammals.
 Obesity is a complex disease caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. Drosophila, a common model organism, has emerged as an effective tool to study metabolic diseases, including obesity. In this study, researchers focused on Cytidine 5'-triphosphate synthase (CTPS), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the de novo synthesis of CTP, which governs the cellular level of CTP and the rate of phospholipid synthesis. CTPS forms filamentous structures called cytoophidia, which are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. The researchers found that CTPS is essential for regulating body weight and starvation resistance in Drosophila by functioning in the fat body. High-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity leads to increased transcription of CTPS and elongated cytoophidia in larval adipocytes. Depleting CTPS in the fat body prevented HFD-induced obesity, including body weight gain, adipocyte expansion, and lipid accumulation, by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis. Additionally, a dominant-negative form of CTPS also prevented adipocyte expansion and downregulated lipogenic genes. These findings establish a functional link between CTPS and lipid homeostasis and highlight the potential role of CTPS manipulation in the treatment of HFD-induced obesity.CTPS is a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo synthesis of CTP, which requires ATP and catalyzes the transfer of amide nitrogen from glutamine to the C-4 position of UTP. CTPS filaments, or cytoophidia, have been observed in various organisms, including humans, and have several functions, including modulation of enzymatic activity, maintenance of cell morphology, and stabilization of CTPS protein. Drosophila, a simplified model of metabolic diseases, has been used to investigate the links between genetics, diet, and metabolism. The Drosophila fat body, an organ with high metabolic activity and conserved signaling pathways, plays a crucial role in sensing nutritional conditions and responding through the integration of lipid metabolism, acting as an equivalent to the mammalian liver or adipose tissue. The researchers' previous investigation revealed that the single Drosophila ortholog of CTPS, which forms cytoophidia in larval adipocytes, promotes adipocyte adhesion mediated by integrin-Collagen IV. Using the Drosophila model, the researchers discovered a significant physiological function for CTPS in lipid metabolism and metabolic adaptation following HFD exposure. HFD feeding results in an upregulation of CTPS transcription and an elongation of CTPS cytoophidia in larval adipocytes. Their findings provide in vivo evidence that CTPS depletion prevents body weight gain and restricts adiposity. These results suggest that adipocytes utilize CTPS to regulate lipid metabolism and adapt to metabolic changes, which may have implications for developing metabolic disease.Keywords: obesity, high-fat diet, Cytidine 5'-triphosphate synthase, cytoophidia, Drosophila, lipid homeostasis.
During the development of vertebrate embryos, the germ layers are patterned by secreted Nodal signals. The classical model suggests that Nodals bind to a complex of Type I and II Activin receptors (Acvr) and the co-receptor TGF1 to initiate signaling. However, it was unclear whether receptor binding could also affect the distribution of Nodals themselves. In a recent study, researchers investigated the roles of different Acvr homologs in zebrafish embryogenesis. They found that all receptor-encoding transcripts, except for Acvr1c, are maternally deposited and present during embryogenesis. By generating mutants and using morpholino knockdown and CRISPR F0 knockout approaches, the researchers discovered that the Acvr2 homologs function partly redundantly and partially independently of Nodal to pattern the early zebrafish embryo. The Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b redundantly act as major mediators of Nodal signaling. The researchers also found that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) is a crucial component of the host defense against viral infections. The initiation of IFN-I production is thought to be stochastic, occurring in only a fraction of cells. However, recent studies have suggested that deterministic factors may also play a role. In this study, researchers used a murine fibroblast model to investigate the influence of various stochastic and deterministic host-intrinsic factors on early IFN-I responses. They found that epigenetic drugs influenced the percentage of responding cells, and that there was transient heritability driving responder fates. Additionally, they found that cell density played a role in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing. These findings challenge the long-held belief that early IFN-I responses are solely driven by stochastic processes and open up new avenues for understanding cellular decision-making during immune responses. This approach could have implications for other immune signaling systems as well.
 Microtubules (MTs) are essential structures in cells, acting as tracks for various cargos, including mRNAs, proteins, and organelles, to be transported. MTs are made up of α- and β-tubulin dimers, and can undergo several post-translational modifications (PTMs), one of which is glutamylation. Glutamylation adds glutamic acid residues to the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin, forming a branched peptide chain. However, little is known about the specific modifications on different tubulin isotypes and their roles in MT transport and other cellular processes in vivo. In this study, researchers investigated the role of TTLL5, an enzyme responsible for mono- and poly-glutamylation of α-tubulin isotypes in Drosophila ovaries. They found that αTub84B and αTub84D, which are expressed in most tissues and throughout development, are glutamylated at their C-terminal ends, while αTub67C, which is expressed exclusively during oogenesis, is not. The results demonstrate that TTLL5 plays a crucial role in the proper localization of glutamylated microtubules and various cellular functions, including the precise localization of Staufen and fast, bidirectional ooplasmic streaming. In the nervous system, a mutation of TTLL5 that inactivates its enzymatic activity decreases the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria. Overall, the study highlights the importance of α-tubulin glutamylation for cellular functions involving microtubule transport.
The study of genome sequences from various organisms has led to a better understanding of molecular evolution. However, using information across multiple genomes remains a challenge, especially in understanding chromosome structure, identifying quantitative trait loci, and testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. To address these challenges, researchers have developed GENESPACE, a new tool that integrates conserved gene order and orthology to determine the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. This method was demonstrated to be effective in studying the evolution of sex chromosomes in vertebrates, the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. GENESPACE offers a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes. By combining synteny and sequence similarity, GENESPACE improves the ability to classify paralogous and orthologous relationships and physically anchors the positions of related gene sequences onto the assemblies of each genome. This allows for a 'pan-genome annotation' framework, which permits access to multi-genome networks of high-confidence orthologs and paralogs, regardless of ploidy or other complicating aspects of genome biology.
Bacteria often live in communities, and their interactions can have significant impacts on human health. One such community, consisting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, can lead to negative healthcare outcomes. While P. aeruginosa can reduce the metabolism and growth of S. aureus in lab conditions, allowing P. aeruginosa to drive S. aureus towards extinction, these bacteria can coexist in vivo. However, little is known about how the growth environment influences their coexistence. In a recent study, researchers used mathematical modeling and experiments to show that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. They found that altering the carbon source in the growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric they call absolute growth. As the absolute growth for one species increases, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. The relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. The findings demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species and provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. This research may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations.Introduction:Bacteria rarely exist in isolation. They often form complex communities, which can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on human health. For instance, they can produce useful products, such as biofuels and degrade harmful environmental pollutants. However, they can also lead to increased virulence and antibiotic resistance. Understanding the principles that shape the interactions and co-existence of microbial community members has significant implications, including enhancing the production of beneficial products and strategies to attenuate antibiotic resistance. One polymicrobial community of concern is composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria co-colonize various environments, including burns, cystic fibrosis patients, and chronic infection sites. Their co-occurrence leads to significantly worse healthcare outcomes, including increased inflammation and longer healing times. The interactions between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are well-known and influence the growth and metabolism of both species. Their co-culture induces interspecies competition, which enhances antibiotic resistance and virulence.Previous studies have reported conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in human hosts. While S. aureus is the predominant bacterial species isolated from pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, its frequency decreases during adolescence and adulthood, while the frequency of P. aeruginosa increases. One leading hypothesis to explain this trend is that P. aeruginosa outcompetes S. aureus through the production of HQNO and siderophores. However, long-term co-existence of these species has been observed in infected hosts, prompting investigations into mechanisms that can account for these conflicting observations. Differences in growth environments have also been suggested to play a role in facilitating co-existence. For instance, differences in environmental albumin concentration and the production of proteins by the immune system have been proposed to impact metabolism and growth of bacteria. Previous work has demonstrated that differences in nutrient availability in the growth environment can affect metabolism and growth of bacteria. Thus, it is possible that differences in nutrients that define the growth environment can affect the co-existence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.To address the role of growth environment on species interactions, researchers investigated whether growth environment-driven changes in growth rate and metabolism affect the co-existence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in co-culture. This research has implications in the bottom-up design of polymicrobial communities and may lead to novel treatment strategies in the clinic.In this study, researchers used a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation to demonstrate that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. They found that altering the carbon source in the growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric they call absolute growth. As the absolute growth for one species increases, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence
Interactions between different species play a crucial role in various aspects of biology, from disease and infection to symbiosis and ecology. However, the vast amount of data on these interactions is scattered across numerous publications, making it difficult to access and utilize for data-driven research. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a framework for curating literature on interspecies interactions, using the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base) as a case study. This framework includes a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to capture data on host, pathogen, strain, gene, and genotype levels. The concept of a multispecies genotype, or 'metagenotype,' is introduced to capture changes in the disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility due to gene alterations. The researchers report on this framework and describe PHI-Canto, a community curation tool for use by publication authors. PHI-Canto is an extension of the Canto tool, which supports curation by both professional curators and authors, but lacked the ability to annotate interspecies interactions and multiple strains. The framework addresses three key issues: classifying genes as 'pathogen' or 'host,' developing the concept of a 'metagenotype,' and creating supporting ontologies and controlled vocabularies, including the Pathogen–Host Interaction Phenotype Ontology (PHIPO), to annotate phenotypes connected to genotypes at the single-species and interspecies levels. The curation framework is a promising approach for adoption and use by various research communities focused on interspecies interactions at different scales and in various environments.
Scientists have identified thousands of enhancers, which are regions of DNA that control cell-type-specific gene transcription, with allele-specific transcription factor (TF) binding and activity in mice. These enhancers are crucial for gene expression and can contribute significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations. However, predicting the effect of a specific sequence variant on enhancer function is challenging due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine TF binding in their native genomic context. In this study, researchers used F1-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice to identify enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and activity. They found that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. The AP-1 family of TFs, including Fos and Jun, were frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function. These findings provide valuable insights into how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.
Viruses rely on the intracellular transport machinery of host cells to promote their replication. These interactions between viruses and host proteins can lead to host gene adaptation, leaving signatures of pathogen-driven evolution in host genomes. In a recent study, researchers identified the dynein activating adaptor, ninein-like (NINL), as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and a target of viral antagonism. NINL, which is unique among genes encoding components of active dynein complexes, has evolved under recurrent positive selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region. The researchers found that NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in increased permissiveness to viral replication. Additionally, they showed that proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. These findings reveal the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of host-virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.
 Actin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of eukaryotic cells. There are six types of actin genes in humans, which are highly conserved but have distinct roles in cells. Actin isoforms have different interactions with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins, and understanding their structures is essential for comprehending normal cytoskeletal physiology. In this study, researchers determined the high-resolution structures of four actin isoforms - skeletal muscle α-actin, cardiac muscle α-actin, β-actin, and γ-actin - in the Mg2+·ADP state with their native post-translational modifications. The structures revealed isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus that shift closer to the filament surface upon myosin binding, establishing isoform-specific interfaces. These structures provide insights into the functions of actin isoforms and complement the existing repertoire of known actin structures.
Transgenesis, the process of introducing foreign DNA into an organism's genome, has been a valuable tool for functional analysis and genetic engineering for decades. While transgenesis has many applications, it can be broadly categorized into two types: specific transgenesis, where a known sequence is introduced, and exploratory transgenesis, where a library of sequences is introduced for functional analysis. High-throughput transgenesis using synthetic DNA libraries has been widely used in single-cell models, but its application in multicellular organisms has been limited due to the Weismann barrier, which separates the germline from the soma. This makes it difficult to introduce exogenous DNA into the germline in a high-throughput manner, limiting the sequence diversity that can be sampled.To overcome this limitation, researchers have developed methods such as Brainbow, ifgMosaic analysis, and P[acman] libraries, but these methods still require significant labor, cost, equipment, and expertise. To address this challenge, a new approach called Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences (TARDIS) has been developed. TARDIS is a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional single-copy transgenesis that increases throughput by separating and reordering the conceptual steps of transgenesis.TARDIS begins with an in vitro-generated DNA sequence library that is introduced into germ cells via traditional low-throughput methods. Instead of directly integrating the sequences from the original library into the desired genomic locus, TARDIS libraries are designed to be incorporated in large numbers into diverse, heritable sub-libraries. These libraries function to create 'metaploidy', expanding the total number of alleles available for inheritance. After population expansion, genome integration of a single-sequence unit is performed by inducing a double-strand break at a genetically engineered landing pad. This landing pad is designed to both integrate a sequence unit and act as a second selectable marker.The TARDIS approach was validated using C. elegans, which naturally forms extrachromosomal arrays that can be several megabases in size. The results showed that large, heritable libraries containing thousands of barcodes can be created and maintained as extrachromosomal arrays. Individual sequences are selected and removed from the library upon experimental induction of Cas9 in a proportion consistent with the composition of the TARDIS library. TARDIS is also compatible with the integration of large promoters and can be used to simultaneously integrate promoters into multiple genomic locations, providing a tool for multiple insertions at defined locations across the genome.In summary, TARDIS is a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional single-copy transgenesis that greatly expands throughput by explicitly separating and reordering the conceptual steps of transgenesis. It is adaptable for any situation where the sequences for integration can be introduced with high diversity and heritability, and where a genomic site for integration is available. This approach has the potential to expand the impact of exploratory transgenesis in functional domains that are dependent on multicellular interactions and difficult to replicate in single-cell models.
The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria play crucial roles in exchanging small molecules with the environment. These proteins undergo a complex journey from the cytosol to their final destination in the outer membrane, which is facilitated by various molecular machines, chaperones, and enzymes. However, the mechanisms behind this process are not well understood due to the challenges in capturing and characterizing protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially transient ones. In this study, researchers used a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline called AF2Complex to identify PPIs within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and applied it to several proteins from the OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening over 1500 envelope proteins, they found both expected and unexpected interactions with significant implications. The researchers then predicted atomic structures for these protein complexes, which explained experimental observations and led to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to a β-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.Introduction:Gram-negative bacteria have a unique structural component called the outer membrane (OM), which is composed of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in an asymmetric bilayer with embedded lipoproteins and transmembrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs). OMPs play vital functional roles, such as exchanging small molecules with the environment through their transmembrane β-barrel porins. OMPs are synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes, translocated across the inner membrane (IM), and finally delivered to the OM via the OMP biogenesis pathway. The translocation and folding of OMPs involve many proteins, including essential and auxiliary ones that form multiple complexes in cooperation. Two core complexes are the SecYEG translocon and the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM). SecYEG, a hetero-trimer composed of the secretion channel SecY and two additional subunits SecE and SecG, is anchored to the IM and is responsible for moving most cell envelope proteins across the IM. Periplasmic and OM proteins enter the channel in SecY via the SecA-dependent translocation pathway. They possess signal peptides recognized by SecA, which inserts a protein substrate into SecY and powers it through the channel using energy from ATP hydrolysis. The signal peptide, located at the N-terminus of a substrate, contains a hydrophobic segment that folds into a transmembrane α-helix once it exits the lateral gate of SecY. To release the substrate from the IM, a type I signal peptidase (SPase I) cleaves the signal peptide. At this point, a periplasmic protein has reached its destination, but an OMP, escorted by the chaperones SurA or Skp, continues its journey toward BAM harbored in the OM. Five subunits constitute BAM, of which BamA plays the major role in folding a β-barrel and releasing the matured product. There are many open questions concerning the OMP biogenesis pathway. In Escherichia coli, the SecYEG translocon recruits additional proteins, such as SecA, SecDF, YidC, and PpiD, to form a variety of supercomplexes in different scenarios. We do not know the identities of all members of these supercomplexes, let alone their atomic structures. SurA plays a major role in chaperoning a nascent OMP. How does it handle and deliver a substrate to BAM? Likewise, BAM recruits additional helpers, such as BepA, but how do they work together? To answer these questions experimentally is challenging. Recently, deep learning approaches have made tremendous progress in predicting the structures of protein complexes. Here, we use one such method to address the above questions. The centerpiece of our approach is AF2Complex, built on AlphaFold2 (AF2). Using AF2Complex, we combine virtual screening for protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and supercomplex modeling and apply this strategy to several important proteins in the OMP biogenesis pathway.
Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons play a crucial role in regulating various functions in the brain, including motivation and cognition. These neurons have complex axonal domains, with a large subset of non-synaptic release sites and a smaller subset of synaptic terminals. The mechanisms underlying the connectivity and neurochemical identity of DA neurons are not well understood. Neuroligins, trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, have been suggested to regulate both DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission. However, the role of their major interaction partners, neurexins (Nrxns), is unexplored. In this study, researchers tested the hypothesis that Nrxns regulate DA neuron neurotransmission by deleting all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::NrxnsKO) in mice. The results showed that these mice exhibited normal basic motor functions but impaired locomotor response to the psychostimulant amphetamine. The striatum of DAT::NrxnsKO mice had decreased levels of the membrane DA transporter (DAT) and increased levels of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), along with reduced activity-dependent DA release. Strikingly, electrophysiological recordings revealed an increase in GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of these mice. These findings suggest that Nrxns act as regulators of the functional connectivity of DA neurons.
Mobile health interventions, or mHealth, are becoming increasingly popular in Africa as a means to improve access to healthcare services. In this study, the authors analyzed data from the Afrobarometer surveys conducted in 33 African countries in 2017-2018 to estimate mobile phone ownership, identify relationships between ownership and proximity to a health clinic, and quantify inequities in ownership based on gender, urban-rural residency, age, and poverty. The authors found that 82% of individuals in these countries own a mobile phone, with 42% owning basic phones and 40% owning smartphones. Those living closer to a health clinic were more likely to own a mobile phone. Men, urban residents, and mobile phone owners were more likely to own smartphones. Ownership increased with age, peaking in the 26-40 age group. However, individuals under 30 were more likely to own smartphones, while older individuals were more likely to own basic phones. Probability of ownership decreased with the Lived Poverty Index, but some of the poorest individuals still owned smartphones. These findings suggest that mHealth interventions, which often require smartphones, may exacerbate existing inequities in access to healthcare. The authors emphasize the importance of considering these inequities when designing and implementing mHealth interventions in Africa.
A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and the risk of future infection following vaccination. The study analyzed data from 9361 individuals from two population-based longitudinal studies, TwinsUK and ALSPAC, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first, second, and third vaccination. The researchers found that individuals with the lowest 20% of anti-Spike antibody levels after the first vaccination had three times greater odds of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 6-9 months compared to those with the highest antibody levels. Individuals identified as being at increased risk of COVID-19 complications through the UK 'Shielded Patient List' had consistently greater odds of having low antibody levels. The third vaccination increased absolute antibody levels for almost all individuals and reduced disparities compared to earlier vaccinations. The findings suggest that higher antibody levels following vaccination are associated with a lower risk of future infection and support a policy of triple vaccination for generating protective antibodies. The study was funded by the UK Health Security Agency and the National Core Studies program.The study also found that socio-demographic, health, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination variables were associated with variation in antibody levels following vaccination. Specifically, individuals with certain comorbidities, immunosuppressant medications, or identified as being at moderate or high risk of COVID-19 complications according to UK government criteria had lower antibody levels following vaccination. The study highlights the importance of considering various factors when assessing the effectiveness of vaccines and the need for continued monitoring and research to ensure equitable access to vaccines and protection against SARS-CoV-2.
