Neural networks in the brain are essential for complex cognitive functions, but it is unclear how they develop from immature to mature forms. The authors of this study investigated the progression of neural activity patterns in the developing brain using high-resolution in vivo electrophysiology in mice. They found that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly after a transient quiescent period at the beginning of the second postnatal week. During this period, neural activity is relatively quiet, and then precise and coordinated activity emerges. This pattern is similar in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the transition to mature brain activity. The authors hypothesize that this quiescent period is necessary for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. The study used high-density electrode arrays to record neural activity in unanesthetized mice, revealing that the transition is characterized by a decrease in coordinated cellular and synaptic activity. In humans, continuous EEG recordings showed a similar developmental trajectory. The findings suggest that mechanisms for regulating functional network capacity may be conserved across species.
A team of researchers investigated how the brain makes decisions by adding unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex in monkeys. They found that increasing the noise led to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically, higher confidence. These findings support the idea that decisions arise from the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. The researchers used neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST to verify their manipulation and found that the effects were in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model. The team's findings provide insights into the role of noise in decision-making and could help explain how the brain makes decisions in uncertain environments.
OCRL is a protein involved in the regulation of intracellular membrane traffic and is linked to two X-linked diseases, Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. OCRL is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits, but the clinical manifestations of these diseases have primarily been attributed to intracellular sorting defects. However, new research suggests that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which was found to bind OCRL directly, remains associated with such vesicles. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations.OCRL is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the inositol ring at the 5 position, and its mutations lead to Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. OCRL is expressed in all tissues and has a broad subcellular distribution, which is mediated by interactions with proteins that control membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton. It has been localized to the Golgi complex, various endosomal compartments, and clathrin-coated pits. OCRL is important in preventing the build-up of ectopic intracellular pools of phosphoinositides, which help define the identity of membranes. The absence of OCRL is thought to disrupt the appropriate coordination between membrane progression and changes in phosphoinositide composition.Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a crucial process for cellular membrane traffic, and it requires the nucleation and expansion of endocytic clathrin coats, which is facilitated by PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane. PI(4,5)P2 is a critical co-receptor for all clathrin adaptors and its levels impact the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits. Coat shedding (uncoating) after the endocytic reaction requires PI(4,5)P2 dephosphorylation. The absence of synaptojanin 1, the most abundant 5-phosphatase in the synapse, results in an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles. OCRL has a role in preventing the accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 on post-endocytic membranes. However, it was unclear whether the absence of OCRL or defects in OCRL function impair clathrin-mediated endocytosis.The goal of this study was to gain new insights into the function of OCRL through a global analysis of the OCRL interactome. This analysis confirmed clathrin and other endocytic adaptors as OCRL binding partners and revealed that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. Prompted by these findings, the researchers examined the contribution of OCRL to clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts. They found that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat, and such vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells. These findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis. Defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.
 In the development of tissues and organs, the distribution of signaling proteins in the form of gradients is crucial for inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms behind gradient formation remain unclear. In this study, researchers investigated the distribution of two signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, in Drosophila using genomic knock-in alleles. They found that FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal disc moves to the air-sac primordium (ASP) through FGFR-containing cytonemes, which extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes decreases with increasing distance from the source, creating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. This gradient activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGF-receiving cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. These results reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion.Introduction:  Morphogenesis, the process by which tissues and organs develop their unique shapes and patterns, is a fundamental aspect of development. This process is orchestrated by conserved paracrine signaling proteins, such as TGFÎ², Hedgehog, Wingless/WNT, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), and Fibroblast growth factor (FGF). These signals coordinate responses in large populations of cells by generating concentration gradients, which induce concentration-dependent gene activities that regulate tissue growth and patterning. However, the mechanisms by which signals disperse and how their dispersion is dynamically modulated to shape gradients in three-dimensional tissue structures are poorly understood. Additionally, the formation of signal gradients is unexplored in most morphogenetic contexts, leaving us without a clear understanding of how signals disperse through the extracellular space to generate the required diversity in gradient shapes and contours for various tissue architectures.Despite recent advancements in live imaging technology, the mechanisms of signal dispersion and how they create long-range signal gradients to regulate tissue morphogenesis remain unclear. Traditionally, all paracrine signals, including FGF family proteins, are thought to function as diffusible signals and form gradients by passive extracellular dispersion. However, this hypothesis is controversial, and recent advancements in live imaging technology have revealed a radically different mechanism of signal dispersion, where signals move directly from producing to recipient cells through actin-based specialized filopodia or cytonemes. Cytonemes and cytoneme-like projections are now known to be required for cell-cell communication mediated by many families of signaling proteins. In this study, researchers aimed to address these fundamental questions by characterizing gradient formation of a Drosophila FGF family protein, Branchless (Bnl).Bnl is the primary signal that guides the branching morphogenesis of tracheal epithelial tubes in Drosophila. At the third instar larval stage, Bnl produced from a restricted group of wing imaginal disc cells induces budding and growth of a wing disc-associated tracheal branch, the air-sac primordium (ASP), from the disc-associated transverse connective (TC). ASP tracheoblast cells are precursors of adult air-sac, an organ that is analogous to the vertebrate lung. Traditionally, all paracrine signals, including FGF family proteins, are thought to function as diffusible signals and form a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. However, whether Bnl forms a gradient and how it is transported and modulated in the extracellular space to form a gradient remain unexplored. Moreover, all tracheal cells express the Bnl receptor, Breathless (Btl), and develop under the guidance of the same Bnl signal, but different embryonic and larval tracheal branches adopt different developmental stage-specific morphologies. We do not understand whether and how the shape of a Bnl gradient can dynamically adapt to diverse tissue morphologies. To investigate these important gaps in knowledge, researchers chose to focus on the Drosophila larval ASP because of its unique features. In this system, the wing disc bnl-source is spatially separated from
Genetic markers along chromosomes can reveal shared ancestry between individuals and help identify historical connections between different population groups due to admixture. In a recent study, researchers analyzed the genetic diversity and gene-flow in 48 sub-Saharan African groups using a genome-wide, haplotype-based approach. They found that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7,000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans due to recent population expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4,000 years. This analysis provides valuable insights into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, which is relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. The findings also shed light on the complex history of Africa and its impact on genetic diversity.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common human virus that can cause various cancers. EBV infects B cells and makes them grow indefinitely, which is important for its survival. However, during the early stages of infection, B cells proliferate rapidly without the viral oncoprotein LMP1, which usually drives their growth. This raises the question of how early-infected B cells survive without LMP1. In this study, researchers used a technique called BH3 profiling to investigate mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis in uninfected, early-infected, and immortalized B cells. They found that early-infected B cells transition from a BCL-2-dependent survival mechanism to one that relies on the viral protein EBNA3A. This change in survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and is critical for EBV lymphomagenesis. The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of EBNA3A in suppressing apoptosis and have implications for the development of therapies for EBV-associated malignancies.Introduction:Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that is associated with various cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Normally, T cells prevent the development of EBV-associated malignancies, and the virus persists quiescently in memory B cells. However, in the absence of a healthy immune system, EBV can transform B cells, leading to increased rates of lymphoma. Primary human B cell infection in vitro serves as a model for oncogenesis in EBV-associated lymphomas.EBV infection requires the expression of six viral latent genes, including Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1), EBNA2, EBNA-LP, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, and Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1). EBNA2, the major viral transcriptional activator, upregulates the expression of these genes and activates the expression of LMP1, which drives the immortalization of infected B cells. LMP1 constitutively activates the NFÎºB pathway, promoting proliferation and suppressing apoptosis in transformed cells.However, recent studies have shown that early after infection, B cells rapidly proliferate despite low levels of LMP1 expression and NFÎºB activation. These early-infected cells also show no overt signs of apoptosis, suggesting that there is a viral-mediated mechanism independent of LMP1 signaling that promotes survival. Several LMP1-independent mechanisms to subvert apoptosis have been described, including the viral BHRF1 and BALF1 proteins, which confer chemoresistance in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma, and the EBNA3 proteins, which epigenetically downregulate genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.In this study, researchers aimed to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFÎºB early after EBV infection. They used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and identified a dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms from uninfected B cells (BCL-2) to early-infected (MCL-1/BCL-2) and immortalized cells (BFL-1). This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.Keywords: Epstein-Barr virus, EBV, B cells, oncogenesis, LMP1, NFÎºB, apoptosis, BH3 profiling, EBNA3A.
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a crucial enzyme responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII's largest subunit, RPB1, plays a significant role in the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and process nascent RNA. The CTD is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats, and extensive post-translational modifications occur during the transcription cycle. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7, which can be acetylated (K7ac). A recent study by Teeling, Fuchs et al. discovered that these K7 residues can also be mono- and di-methylated (K7me1 and K7me2). K7me1 and K7me2 occur during the earliest stages of transcription and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. The study reveals an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels.RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a vital enzyme responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes in eukaryotes. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit, RPB1, plays a crucial role in the co-transcriptional recruitment of chromatin modifiers and RNA processing machinery. The CTD is a large, structurally disordered domain composed of a tandem heptapeptide repeat structure, with the consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. Extensive remodeling of the CTD occurs during distinct steps of the transcription cycle. RNAPII binds to promoter regions in a hypophosphorylated state, before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at Serine-5 (S5p) and Serine-7 (S7p), marking the earliest stages of transcription. Productive elongation is characterized by an increase in phosphorylation of Serine-2 (S2p) throughout gene bodies, with the highest levels found around transcription end sites. S5p is essential for recruitment of the capping machinery, while S2p is involved in the recruitment of splicing and polyadenylation factors.The CTD's tandem repeat structure is conserved across eukaryotes, but the number of repeats varies widely among different taxa. The most complex multicellular organisms, such as vertebrates, have longer CTDs, while unicellular organisms like yeast have fewer repeats. The mammalian CTD retains a core of 21 consensus repeats but has accumulated a diversity of non-consensus repeats, particularly at its most C-terminal region. In vertebrates, non-canonical amino-acid residues occur most frequently at the seventh position of the heptapeptide repeat, and the most frequent substitution replaces the canonical S7 residue with a lysine (K7). Previous work has shown that non-canonical CTD-K7 residues can be acetylated, and that CTD-K7ac is associated with transcriptional pausing at epidermal growth factor (EGF)-inducible genes in mouse fibroblasts.To further explore the increasing complexity of CTD modifications over evolution, their temporal sequence, and how they interplay with each other, Teeling, Fuchs et al. investigated the possibility of additional modification of non-canonical CTD residues. They identified mono- and di-methylation of CTD-K7 residues in both vertebrates and invertebrates. K7me1 and K7me2 occur during the earliest stages of transcription and precede or accompany phosphorylation of S5 and S7, upstream of S2 phosphorylation. Using biochemical and genome-wide approaches, they showed that CTD-K7 methylation is present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA, but defines the earliest stages of the transcription cycle. Through detailed analysis of abundance and distribution of different CTD modifications at gene promoters in embryonic stem (ES)
The Swi2/Snf2 family of ATPases plays a crucial role in remodeling various substrates, including nucleosomes and transcription complexes, to control a wide range of DNA-associated processes. However, the mechanisms behind these ATP-dependent remodeling reactions are not well understood. Mot1, a single-subunit remodeler, is a useful model system to study Swi2/Snf2 ATPases due to its ability to dissociate TATA box-binding protein (TBP) from DNA complexes. In this study, researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). The findings suggest that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA, potentially priming TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data indicate that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for understanding how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.Introduction:Swi2/Snf2 ATPases are a large and diverse class of proteins and multiprotein assemblies within the SF2 superfamily of helicases/translocases. They are best known for their role in regulating the spatial arrangement and histone composition of nucleosomes, such as in the SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80 remodelers. Swi2/Snf2 enzymes are thought to track the minor groove of DNA, generating tension that induces transient or permanent alterations in molecular assemblies. Although high-resolution structures of some Swi2/Snf2 domains and their substrate-interacting domains associated with DNA and protein have been described, detailed structural information about these ATPases bound to substrate proteins and DNA is largely absent. The lack of structural insights is due to the complex and often multisubunit architecture of Swi2/Snf2 enzyme-containing complexes and their inherent structural flexibilities. Mot1, a Swi2/Snf2 member, is a useful model system for studying Swi2/Snf2 enzymes in vitro. Mot1 dissociates TBP from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, directly regulating transcription initiation and global redistribution of TBP in the cell. Unlike most other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes, Mot1 does not require any associated subunit for its essential activity.The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Encephalitozoon cuniculi Mot1 (Mot1NTD) in complex with TBP revealed that Mot1 consists of 16 HEAT repeats arranged in a horseshoe-like shape. A long loop between HEAT repeats 2 and 3, called the 'latch,' can bind to TBP's concave site and block TBP-DNA association. Previous analyses have revealed not only how Mot1 binds TBP but also that Mot1 functions as a TBP chaperone. However, it remained unclear how Mot1 directly impacts the TBP:DNA 'substrate' state prior to the remodeling reaction. Obtaining a substrate state with DNA and TBP turned out to be difficult because Mot1NTD can disrupt TBP:DNA by its latch. However, the Mot1:TBP:DNA complex is much more stable in the presence of negative cofactor 2 (NC2), another global transcriptional regulator whose occurrence coincides with Mot1 and TBP at many genomic locations. NC2 is a heterodimer composed of Î± and Î² subunits, which highly resemble histones H2A and H2B, respectively. The researchers crystallized E. cuniculi Mot1NTD in complex with TBP, NC2, and a TATA promoter DNA fragment and present here the crystal structure of this complex at 3.8 Ã resolution along with biochemical, electron microscopy, and cross-linking studies of the full-length Mot1 complex. Their study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex.Keywords: structural biology, molecular biophysics, Swi2/Snf2 ATPases, Mot1, T
Meiosis is the process by which cells produce haploid gametes, and accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is crucial for the production of healthy gametes. Chromosome segregation depends on the coordination between cohesion resolution and kinetochore-microtubule interactions. A protein called Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) plays an important role in this process. Sgol2 protects cohesin, which holds sister chromatids together, and helps turn off the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which regulates the timing of chromosome segregation. Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, a protein phosphatase, but its effect on SAC silencing is mediated by direct binding to Mad2, a key SAC protein. Sgol2's effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and is mediated by the recruitment of MCAK, a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, and the inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively. By linking these essential processes, Sgol2 plays a crucial role in ensuring faithful chromosome segregation.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of invasive diseases in infants, particularly in low-income settings, spends most of its transmission cycle in the nasopharynx. Understanding the duration of this carriage period is crucial for controlling transmission and predicting disease risk. In a recent study, researchers used longitudinal swab data and whole genome sequences to estimate the heritability of carriage duration. They found that genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The genomic variation was partitioned into lineage and locus effects, with serotype explaining 17% of the variation, drug-resistance 9%, and other significant locus effects 7%. The study also identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration, potentially by disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.Introduction:Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that causes diseases such as pneumonia, otitis media, and meningitis. The disease burden is highest in children. For disease to occur, pneumococci must first transmit to the host, colonize the nasopharynx, and finally cross into a normally sterile site. The nasopharynx is a complex niche where each pneumococcal genotype must tackle a wide range of factors, including host immune defense, other bacterial species, and other pneumococcal lineages, to maintain its population. The average nasopharyngeal duration period is affected by a large number of factors, which may interact. One factor that is known to strongly associate with carriage duration is serotype. However, the overall and relative contributions of these sequence variations to carriage rate have not yet been characterized. Changes in average carriage duration have been linked with recombination rate, which has been found to correlate with antibiotic resistance and invasive potential. Measuring carriage duration and the analysis of its variance beyond the resolution of serotype will have important consequences for epidemiological models. In this study, researchers sought to determine the overall importance of the pathogen genotype in carriage duration and to identify and quantify the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration.Methods:The researchers combined epidemiological modeling of longitudinal swab data with genome-wide association study methods on the connected sequences to make heritability estimates for carriage duration. They further partitioned the heritability into contributions from lineage and locus effects to quantify the variation caused by each individual factor.Results:The study found that genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The genomic variation was partitioned into lineage and locus effects, with serotype explaining 17% of the variation, drug-resistance 9%, and other significant locus effects 7%. The study also identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration, potentially by disrupting the competence mechanism.Conclusion:These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance. Understanding the factors that influence carriage duration is crucial for controlling transmission and predicting disease risk. The study's findings will have important implications for epidemiological models and the evaluation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine's efficacy. Additionally, the study proposes that alleles that alter carriage duration may explain the long-standing puzzle of how antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains stably coexist in the population. Measuring carriage duration and the analysis of its variance beyond the resolution of serotype will have important consequences for these models.
C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has evolved independently in over 60 plant lineages, but the evolutionary pathways leading to this trait are not well understood. In a recent study, researchers used a combination of computational modeling and experimental verification to explore the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. They analyzed 18 lineages of plants that use C3, C4, or intermediate forms of photosynthesis and identified four major evolutionary trajectories for the development of C4 photosynthesis.The researchers used a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape to parameterize the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and developed a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model to predict the order of C4 trait acquisition. They found that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was not a fixed process, but rather flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic factors.The study suggests that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was influenced by various factors, including the initial phenotypic alterations and the ancestral lineage. This flexibility likely facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait. The findings of this study could help inform efforts to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species.C4 photosynthesis is a complex process that involves modifications to leaf anatomy, cellular ultrastructure, and photosynthetic metabolism. It is estimated to have first evolved between 32 and 25 million years ago in response to ecological drivers such as decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. C4 plants have since become some of the most productive crops and native vegetation on the planet due to their increased photosynthetic efficiency.The evolution of C4 photosynthesis involves the modification of photosynthetic metabolism and the compartmentalization of photosynthetic processes between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. C4 acids are decarboxylated in bundle sheath cells to increase CO2 supply to RuBisCO, the primary carboxylase. The decarboxylation of C4 acids is carried out by one of three enzymes: NADP-dependent malic enzyme, NAD-dependent malic enzyme, or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.The researchers found that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was not a linear process, but rather a complex and flexible one. The study provides new insights into the evolution of this important trait and could help inform efforts to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species.Keywords: C4 photosynthesis, plant biology, evolution, complex traits, Bayesian modeling, phenotypic landscape.
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common cause of respiratory illness in humans and animals. To ensure efficient production of viral proteins, IAV uses a strategy called host shutoff, which reduces the translation of cellular mRNAs and prioritizes the translation of viral mRNAs. The mechanisms behind this shutoff process have been debated, with some suggesting that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated and others that host mRNAs are degraded. In a recent study, researchers used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms of IAV-induced host shutoff.The results showed that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, but rather that the decline in cellular protein synthesis is due to viral takeover of the mRNA pool. The researchers also found that short cellular transcripts are less affected by IAV, and these refractory mRNAs are enriched in genes related to cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation.These findings advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest a mechanism for the translation of important housekeeping genes. The study also highlights the importance of considering both the degradation of host mRNAs and the co-opting of the translation machinery in understanding the complex process of host shutoff during IAV infection.Keywords: Influenza A virus, host shutoff, RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, oxidative phosphorylation.
Cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria that can perform photosynthesis, have a built-in circadian clock that helps them align their biological activities with the daily changes in light and dark conditions. The clock is controlled by a protein called RpaA, which regulates the expression of genes involved in various metabolic pathways. In constant light conditions, the absence of RpaA does not affect the bacteria's ability to survive. However, when light and dark periods alternate, the absence of RpaA makes the bacteria unable to maintain an appropriate energy status during the night and unable to accumulate carbon reserves during the day. This leads to a defect in the transcription of genes crucial for utilizing carbohydrate stores at night. By reconstructing carbon utilization pathways and providing an external carbon source, researchers were able to restore energy charge and viability to the RpaA-deficient strain in light/dark cycling conditions. These findings highlight the importance of the circadian output pathway in controlling and coordinating essential metabolic pathways in cyanobacteria to maximize their fitness in response to periodic energy limitations.
 Coiled coils are well-studied protein structures, with a backbone that can be described using parametric equations. These structures are made up of at least two helices that wind together, held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. The periodicity of coiled coils can vary, but is usually described in terms of heptads, which consist of seven positions labeled a to g. The most common coiled coils follow a heptad repeat pattern, with positions a and d being hydrophobic and the others being more variable. However, the insertion of just two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat can lead to the formation of a new type of fiber called an Î±/Î² coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the formation of short Î²-strands that move the path of the chain by 120 degrees around the trimer axis. The result is a coiled coil with both Î±-helical and Î²-sheet structure, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. This discovery shows that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.
Hemoglobin (Hb), a protein responsible for oxygen delivery in the body, has long been studied as a model protein to understand molecular adaptation in vertebrates. While it was previously believed that only the affinity of oxygen binding to Hb affects tissue oxygen delivery, a new study suggests that both affinity and cooperativity play a role in evolutionary and physiological adaptations. The researchers derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the 'biophysical Hill landscape' to describe this relation. They found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape, allowing for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues. The findings provide insight into the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb and have implications for understanding molecular adaptation in other proteins.
The Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla has a unique reproductive system that allows females to compete for semen in their nutrient-poor habitats. This system includes a penis-like intromittent organ in females and a switching valve in the female genitalia. The valve is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. The semen, which is used for fertilization and as nutrition for the female, is packed in a capsule that is formed upon injection. The female can have two seminal capsules at a time, allowing her to mate repeatedly while one is being used. This switching valve, in conjunction with the female penis, enables females to coercively anchor males for longer copulation times and obtain more semen. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. The small size and fragile composition of the spermathecal plate, a component of the valve, have made it difficult to study, but this research used a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy and high-resolution synchrotron microcomputed tomography to investigate its structure and function. The findings suggest that the plate plays an important role in the evolution of the reversed intromittent organs in Neotrogla.
Researchers have long been studying the behavior of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the brain, specifically how they move within and outside of post-synaptic densities (PSDs) in rat brains. Previous studies suggested that the size of the fluorophore used to label AMPARs could impact their behavior. In this study, researchers used super-resolution microscopy to examine how fluorophore size and photostability affected AMPAR trafficking in rat brain slices. They found that over 90% of AMPARs labeled with small fluorescent dyes or small quantum dots (sQDs) were confined to stable nanodomains within PSDs for at least 15 minutes. In contrast, only 5-10% of sQD-labeled AMPARs were found outside of PSDs and were highly mobile. However, when AMPARs were labeled with larger quantum dots (bQDs), 90-95% were found outside of PSDs and were highly mobile.Contrary to previous hypotheses, the findings suggest that AMPARs do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes and do not enter PSDs through the occupancy of open PSD 'slots'. Instead, AMPARs enter stable nanodomains within PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. The study also found that the size and photostability of the fluorophore used to label AMPARs did not significantly impact their behavior within PSDs. These findings provide new insights into the role of AMPARs in synaptic plasticity and may help explain the mechanisms underlying learning and memory.The study also highlights the importance of using appropriate labeling techniques and considering the size and photostability of fluorophores when studying the behavior of proteins within cells. The use of super-resolution microscopy and different-sized fluorescent probes allowed for a more accurate understanding of AMPAR dynamics in the brain.Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and the role of AMPARs in this process. It also highlights the importance of using appropriate labeling techniques and considering the size and photostability of fluorophores when studying protein behavior within cells.
Histones are proteins that help package DNA into structures called nucleosomes, which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In the fruit fly Drosophila, a complex called DOMINO is responsible for both histone acetylation and the incorporation of a specific histone variant called H2A.Z. However, it was unclear how DOMINO achieved these two functions. In this study, researchers discovered that DOMINO actually consists of two distinct complexes, DOM-A and DOM-B, each with unique functions. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.Z in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, on the other hand, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex. This finding demonstrates how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separations. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. In Drosophila, the same diversity is generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of chromatin regulation and the role of alternative splicing in generating functional diversity among chromatin regulators.
Membrane nanodomains play a crucial role in regulating the behavior of Ras, a key signaling molecule, but the nature of these domains and their interaction with Ras remains unclear. In a recent study, researchers used advanced microscopy techniques to investigate the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D, an active mutant of KRas, in U2OS cells. They found that KRasG12D exhibits an immobile state in small, 70 nm domains embedded in larger, 200 nm domains, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D remain constant across a broad range of protein expression levels. These findings offer new insights into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling and reveal how membrane organization dictates the behavior of this important signaling molecule.The plasma membrane is a complex and dynamic environment that plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of membrane-localized signaling molecules, including Ras. While the biochemical interactions between Ras and its downstream effectors have been well studied, the mechanisms through which the membrane defines the signaling activity and specificity of Ras are still not well understood. Recent studies suggest that Ras signaling may involve the formation of multimers in a membrane-dependent manner, and that partitioning of Ras into nanoscopic membrane domains and interactions with scaffold proteins or structures are critical steps to Ras multimer formation and signaling.Previous studies using static imaging techniques, such as immuno-EM and quantitative superresolution microscopy, have revealed the existence of Ras multimers but provided limited information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras-membrane domain interactions. Live-cell single-particle tracking (SPT) complements static imaging by providing information about molecular motions and has been used to study Ras dynamics on the membrane. However, the technical constraints of traditional SPT limited the imaging throughput and depth of analysis.To overcome these limitations, researchers have recently made significant advances in both experimental and data analysis strategies of SPT. One such method, spt-PALM, combines SPT with photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to enable single molecule tracking under dense labeling conditions through stochastic photoswitching. With spt-PALM, it is now possible to acquire thousands of diffusion trajectories from a single cell, providing a wealth of data for detailed and quantitative analysis.Using spt-PALM, the researchers found that KRasG12D exhibits three diffusion states: a fast diffusion state, an immobile state, and an intermediate mobility state. They were able to spatially map the diffusion states to distinctive membrane domains, estimate the size and lifetime of each domain, and define the spatial relationship between the domains. They also discovered that KRasG12D transitions from one diffusion state to another following a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) model, potentially coupled to the endocytic trafficking and membrane recycling of KRasG12D.Based on these results, the researchers propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D, where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking, with implications for Ras multimer formation and signaling. These findings offer new insights into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling and provide a foundation for further investigation into the role of membrane organization in regulating the behavior of other signaling molecules.
In recent years, there have been several reports suggesting that magnetic fields can influence biological molecules and cells in significant ways. One study claimed to have identified a protein complex that functions like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals (Qin et al., 2016). Another study reported magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then manipulating it with a magnetic field (Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016). However, these findings conflict with fundamental laws of physics. The discrepancies between the reported phenomena and the proposed explanations are vast, ranging from 5 to 10 log units. If these effects do indeed occur, they must have causes entirely different from those suggested by the authors.The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes poses a serious challenge for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. In this short report, I will argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics and suggest alternative explanations for the observed phenomena. These considerations should help in evaluating future hypotheses and in engineering new molecular tools for magnetogenetics.Introduction:Magnetosensation, the ability of organisms to sense the Earth's magnetic field for navigation, and magnetogenetics, the dream of making neurons and other cells responsive to magnetic fields for easy control, are two closely related fields. Understanding the physical principles that govern magnetic fields' interactions with biological matter is crucial for both. The fundamental laws of magnetism, which dictate how magnetic fields act on matter, should provide some constraints on plausible biological mechanisms for both magnetosensation and magnetogenetics.Recently, a series of high-profile articles have put forward audacious proposals in this domain without considering these physical constraints. In this report, I will offer some calculations to provide a reality check for these claims and to help evaluate future hypotheses in this field. These arguments should also aid in the engineering of new molecular tools for magnetogenetics.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a condition characterized by impaired pitch perception, have been shown to rely less on pitch cues during speech perception and instead use other dimensions such as duration. To understand the neural basis for this strategy, researchers conducted an fMRI study comparing individuals with amusia and controls. During the study, participants were asked to match sentences with spoken versions that differed in pitch and/or duration cues. The results showed that individuals with amusia had reduced functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions. This connectivity difference was not present during a control task, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. The findings indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions.
NCOA4 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the autophagic turnover of ferritin, a process that helps regulate intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy flux and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated the interaction between NCOA4 and ferritin, specifically the FTH1 protein, and found that direct association between them is necessary for ferritin delivery to the lysosome via autophagosomes. Additionally, NCOA4 abundance is controlled by both autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation in zebrafish and cultured cells, and this work provides insights into the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy.
ISG15 is a protein that plays a role in the immune response against viruses by modifying other proteins. It is activated when cells are infected with a virus and interferon is produced. However, its role during bacterial infections is not well understood. In this study, researchers found that ISG15 is also produced in response to bacterial infection by Listeria, but this response does not require interferon. Instead, it is triggered by the detection of bacterial DNA in the cell's cytosol through a surveillance pathway involving STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. Importantly, the researchers found that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in both lab experiments and in living animals. They also identified several proteins that are modified by ISG15, which are primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This modification leads to increased secretion of cytokines that help to counteract the infection. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of ISG15 in the innate immune response to bacterial infections.
The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is known for its ability to navigate using odor gradients. In order to understand how the early olfactory system processes temporal variations of odor stimuli, researchers exposed flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and analyzed the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). They found that the PN output strongly signaled the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model that takes the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs accurately predicted the PN output. This suggests that PNs primarily signal the acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.The olfactory system is crucial for animals to detect and respond to temporal variations of odor stimuli, as odors in nature are often intermittent and dynamic. Drosophila larvae and adults exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors, such as moving towards an attractive odor and staying within a specific odor zone. To understand how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in the insect early olfactory system, researchers have investigated the neural encoding of odor signals in insects. However, most previous studies used a simple odor delivery system that generated step-pulse-like odor stimuli, which does not accurately represent natural odor plumes.In Drosophila, OSNs expressing the same receptors connect with PNs in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments, called olfactory glomeruli, in the antennal lobe. PNs then relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn. Recent studies have shown that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time. Building on this, researchers analyzed the correlation structure of input/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway and constructed a two-dimensional linear-nonlinear model of the OSN-to-PN transformation. This model accurately predicted the PN output based on the OSN spike rate and its rate of change.These findings provide insights into how the olfactory system processes temporal variations of odor stimuli and create internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments. This understanding could lead to a better understanding of how animals navigate and respond to complex odor environments.
