Fleas can transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). The efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and rodent hosts. In this study, researchers investigated the mechanism of EPT and the effect of host blood on it by feeding fleas bacteremic mouse, rat, guinea pig, or gerbil blood and examining the location and characteristics of the infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pestis. Surprisingly, fleas that fed on bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood refluxed a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 hours, a phenomenon called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). This phenomenon was rarely observed in rodent fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER was associated with the accumulation of a dense mixed aggregate of Y. pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals that filled the proventriculus. Three days after feeding on bacteremic rat blood, groups of Oropsylla montana transmitted significantly more CFUs than did groups infected using mouse blood, and this enhanced transmission was biofilm-dependent. The data support a model in which EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut, and that EPT and BDT can sometimes overlap. The relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of rats and Sciurids and the slower digestion of their blood may promote regurgitative transmission, which may be one reason why these rodents are particularly prominent in plague ecology.
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient viral infections that have been integrated into the host germline and passed down through generations. Some ERVs are believed to function as restriction factors against exogenous retroviruses by interfering with their replication. Sheep, which carry two exogenous retroviruses, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), and related endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs), provide an interesting model system to study the coevolution of retroviruses and their hosts. In this study, researchers isolated and characterized 27 enJSRV proviruses, which have been integrating into the sheep genome for the past 5-7 million years. Two of these proviruses, enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20, acquired a defective Gag polyprotein in two distinct events, resulting in a transdominant phenotype that blocks late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses. These transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication, approximately 9,000 years ago. Interestingly, a provirus that escapes the transdominant enJSRVs has recently emerged. This study suggests that the endogenization and selection of ERVs as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections.Introduction:Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have been integrated into the host germline and passed down through generations. These elements, also known as endogenous retroviruses, follow Mendelian inheritance rules like any other host gene. The continuous accumulation of new retroviral integrations over millions of years, a process called endogenization, has resulted in the genomes of all vertebrates being heavily colonized by ERVs. Most ERVs have accumulated genetic defects that render them unable to express infectious virus or proteins. However, some ERVs are transcriptionally active and have maintained intact open reading frames for some of their genes, raising the possibility that they may be beneficial to their hosts. One proposed explanation for the selection of some ERVs in vertebrates is their ability to provide protection against infection of related exogenous pathogenic retroviruses. Sheep, which carry two exogenous retroviruses, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), and related endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs), provide an interesting model system to study retrovirus-host coevolution.Background:Exogenous retroviruses, such as JSRV and ENTV, infect the host germline and result in stably integrated endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). These elements are passed down through generations like any other host gene. The continuous accumulation of new retroviral integrations over millions of years, a process also known as endogenization, has resulted in the genomes of all vertebrates being heavily colonized by ERVs. Most ERVs have accumulated genetic defects that render them unable to express infectious virus or proteins. However, some ERVs are transcriptionally active and have maintained intact open reading frames for some of their genes, raising the possibility that they may be beneficial to their hosts. One proposed explanation for the selection of some ERVs in vertebrates is their ability to provide protection against infection of related exogenous pathogenic retroviruses.Sheep as a Model System:Sheep provide an interesting model system to study retrovirus-host coevolution due to the coexistence in this animal species of two exogenous oncogenic retroviruses, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), with highly related and biologically active endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs). These endogenous retroviruses have been integrating in the host genome for the last 5-7 million years. Two enJSRV proviruses, enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20, have been shown to efficiently interfere with the replication of related exogenous retroviruses. However, data suggesting that these mechanisms have influenced the coevolution of endogenous and/or exogenous retroviruses and their hosts have been more difficult to obtain.
The Drosophila embryo's gonad is formed from two distinct cell types: Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells (SGPs). PGCs form at the embryo's posterior during the blastoderm stage and must traverse the midgut wall and migrate through the mesoderm to reach the SGPs. The migration of PGCs is guided by a combination of local repulsive cues and attractive signals emanating from the SGPs. In this study, we investigated the role of the hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) in directing PGC migration.Shf encodes a secreted protein that facilitates long-distance Hh transmission through the proteoglycan matrix after it is released from basolateral membranes of Hh-expressing cells in the wing imaginal disc. Shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm, and loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that it is required for PGC migration.The hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in generating the PGC attractant both by the SGPs and by other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. We show that production of this PGC attractant depends upon shf as well as a second hh pathway gene gγ1.Further linking the PGC attractant to Hh, we present evidence indicating that ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release/transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into and through the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. Potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend upon cholesterol modification.In summary, our findings suggest that shf plays a crucial role in the hh pathway's regulation of PGC migration by facilitating long-distance Hh transmission from the basolateral membranes of Hh-expressing cells to the mesoderm, where it can interact with migrating PGCs.
In a recent study, we explored the role of neurogenesis in a simplified model of the hippocampus, focusing on its ability to encode and decode memory patterns despite changing input statistics. We found that additive neurogenesis, where new neurons are added to an expanding network, was a more effective adaptation strategy compared to conventional synaptic plasticity and neuronal turnover. In this study, we expanded our model to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. We compared the network's performance using three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. Our results confirmed that additive neurogenesis was the superior adaptation strategy when using realistic, spatially structured input patterns. We also introduced a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporated cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells, which further improved network performance. We examined the time course of adult neurogenesis over an animal's lifetime under different hypothetical rearing conditions and identified distinct features that could be tested experimentally. Additionally, we showed that place cells could emerge and refine in a realistic manner in our model due to the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer. Overall, our findings suggest that additive neurogenesis is a crucial adaptation strategy for the hippocampus, allowing the network to respond to changes in input statistics while preserving earlier representations.

This study aimed to understand the transcriptional regulation of pluripotent cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, by identifying genes upregulated in pluripotent cells and the regulatory motifs that control their expression. The researchers analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and primordial germ cells and identified genes enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. They developed a computational algorithm, CompMoby, to identify short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression by combining analyses of aligned and non-aligned sequences with a probabilistic segmentation model. CompMoby identified conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, which were active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells and could act as enhancers. The activity of these motifs was conserved in human ES cells. The transcription factor NF-Y specifically binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that the systematic approach used can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species.Keywords: pluripotent cells, embryonic stem cells, primordial germ cells, transcriptional regulation, computational biology, regulatory motifs, NF-Y, gene expression, mammals, developmental biology.
A better understanding of the cellular requirements and mechanisms of hepatitis C virus (HCV) secretion is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies. In this study, researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to analyze host factors involved in HCV secretion and live cell imaging to observe HCV core trafficking. RNAi analysis identified several components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases, VAMP1 vesicles, and adaptor proteins, as well as the recycling endosome. The results suggest that HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. The researchers also used a Tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in the core protein (TC-core) to monitor the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors. They found that HCV core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and that this movement can be inhibited by nocodazole. Sub-populations of TC-core localize to the Golgi and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles. This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress and presents dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells.Introduction:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that infects hepatocytes and causes liver damage. The current model of HCV production involves the assembly of virions on or near lipid droplets, envelopment at the ER in association with components of VLDL synthesis, and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements and mechanisms of HCV secretion are not well understood. In this study, researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) and live cell imaging to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress.RNAi analysis identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. The results support a model wherein HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway.To isolate core protein movements associated with infectious HCV secretion, the researchers constructed infectious HCV with a tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in the core protein (TC-core). They found that TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and that this movement can be inhibited by nocodazole. Sub-populations of TC-core localize to the Golgi and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles.This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress and presents dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells. These findings provide valuable insights into the cellular mechanisms of HCV secretion and may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for HCV infection.Keywords: hepatitis C virus, HCV, RNA interference, secretory pathway, HCV core trafficking, apolipoprotein E, VAMP1, recycling endosome.
This study investigates the conformational behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, which possess secondary amphiphilicity and form alpha-helices. The researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the peptides' conformational preferences and their response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces. The results showed that the peptides are not random coils or fully formed alpha helices but adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. These conformations provide a basis for conformation-selection and population-shift upon environmental changes. The peptides' aggregation behavior is also influenced by the presence or absence of interfaces and depends on their surface charge and hydrophobicity. The findings suggest that the peptides' conformational preferences are particularly susceptible to environmental conditions and provide insights into the role of interfaces in the folding and aggregation of peptides and proteins.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of a virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization, disease, and transmission, both with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. The goal was to identify vulnerable points in the multiple stages of pneumococcal pathogenesis, specifically population bottlenecks. The findings revealed that during IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. These observations demonstrate how viral infection and TLR-dependent innate immune responses it stimulates are required to control pneumococcal contagion.Pneumococci are a leading cause of disease, primarily affecting the respiratory tract, and can cause otitis media, pneumonia, and sepsis. They are predominantly commensal organisms that colonize the human nasopharynx and are transmitted through respiratory secretions. Pneumococcal infection can be controlled through immunization, which protects individuals from bacteremia and provides herd immunity.To better understand the mechanisms responsible for protection against pneumococcal disease, researchers sought to identify the steps during infection where pneumococci must pass through a population bottleneck. A bottleneck could occur due to host barriers, local defense, microbial competition, or a requirement for increased fitness through genetic adaptation. The study employed an infant mouse model that recapitulates many of the key features of pneumococcal pathogenesis, including increased susceptibility early in life, occurrence of localized disease in normally sterile sites within the respiratory tract, and close contact leading to increased host-to-host transmission.The findings revealed that during IAV co-infection, pneumococci must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts.

HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can spread both in a cell-free state and from cell to cell. However, the importance of cell-cell transmission in natural infection and its vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors is not well understood. In this study, we used specifically designed experimental strategies to distinguish between the two transmission routes and investigated the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and entry inhibitors during cell-cell transmission. We found that gp41-directed agents remain active, while CD4 binding site (CD4bs) directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, lose potency during cell-cell transmission. This suggests that CD4bs mAbs act preferentially by blocking free virus transmission, while allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. This finding provides a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs-directed antibody responses in vivo.HIV spreads efficiently between cells through virological synapses and transient cell-cell contacts, and cell-cell transmission may be a dominant mode of virus dissemination in infected individuals. However, the relative contribution of cell-cell and cell-free virus transmission to acquisition of HIV infection and viral dissemination during human infection remains undefined. This gap in knowledge poses a challenge for the development of neutralizing antibody-based HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors, as it is unclear whether both cell-free and cell-cell spread of HIV must be blocked with equal efficacy or if only the dominant transmission mode needs to be targeted.Neutralizing antibodies recognize epitopes on the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 that are accessible in the oligomeric form of the HIV envelope protein. Neutralization occurs by blocking virion attachment to host cell receptors or by inhibiting membrane fusion. However, it is unclear to what extent the relatively enclosed environment of the viral synapse is able to protect the virus from humoral immunity. Previous studies on the capacity of individual neutralizing antibodies to inhibit cell-cell transmission have reported conflicting results, suggesting it was entirely inefficient, less efficient than inhibition of cell-free infection, or equally efficient. These discrepancies may be due to differences in cell types studied and experimental procedures.To derive a definite conclusion on the capacity of neutralizing antibodies to block cell-cell transmission of HIV, we used assay systems that allow overcoming limitations and explicitly monitoring cell-cell transmission. Our comprehensive in vitro analysis of inhibitor activity during cell-free and cell-cell virus transmission provides a necessary first step towards the definition of the in vivo relevance of the respective transmission modes and ensuing requirements for their inhibition by vaccine-induced antibody responses and entry inhibitors.
Genetic testing for complex diseases, such as those with multiple susceptibility variants, holds promise for personalized risk prediction. However, evaluating the performance of these tests is crucial for clinical utility. Previous studies have primarily used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC, to assess predictive value. However, AUC has limitations and should be complemented with other measures. In this study, we propose a novel statistical framework to estimate various prediction metrics, including AUC, mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases explained, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. We demonstrate how to construct graphs to visualize risk model performance, such as ROC curves, density of risks, and predictiveness curves. Our theoretical estimates match well with simulation results. We apply this methodology to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants.Introduction:Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants for complex diseases, raising hope for individualized risk prediction based on genomic profiles. However, the modest effect size of a single genetic marker and the controversy surrounding clinical utility call for appropriate measures to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC, is a popular method for assessing test discriminatory ability. However, AUC has limitations and is not the only way to evaluate a prediction model's performance. In this study, we propose a novel unifying statistical framework that connects various prediction metrics and constructs graphs to visualize risk model performance.The framework is based on the liability threshold model, which assumes an underlying liability that is normally distributed. Affected individuals have a liability above the threshold. Given the overall disease prevalence and total variance in liability explained by the set of susceptibility variants, it is possible to estimate analytically the aforementioned prediction indices and construct graphs to visualize the performance of risk models.Keywords: complex diseases, genetic testing, risk prediction, AUC, ROC curve, liability threshold model, prediction metrics, statistical framework.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene, which is the homolog of the human XPD gene, plays a crucial role in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Mutations in RAD3, specifically rad3-101 and rad3-102, have been identified, which have partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies have shown that the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3-101 and rad3-102 strains can be explained by persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. However, these studies did not detect the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. In this study, the authors further characterized these events using a system that recovers the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 strains elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events revealed that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs), and the remaining reflect DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. The authors mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. They found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. Additionally, there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. The authors suggest that a subset of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
A proposed budget cut to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and West Nile virus could leave the country unprepared to handle new and existing diseases. To demonstrate the potential consequences of such a measure, we used a mathematical model to simulate the impact of delayed control responses to a dengue epidemic in Cairns, Queensland, Australia, due to halted mosquito surveillance. Our findings reveal that halting mosquito surveillance can significantly increase the management costs of epidemics, up to an order of magnitude more than a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The total costs of prevention through surveillance are much lower than the costs of responding to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, not even considering the cost in human lives and well-being. Our study emphasizes the importance of maintaining mosquito surveillance and early detection systems for effective vector-borne disease management.
Insulator elements are crucial for regulating gene expression by preventing inappropriate interactions between enhancers and promoters. CTCF, a zinc-finger protein, is a well-known enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, but its role in Drosophila has only recently been studied. In this study, researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation and genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites in the Drosophila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the Bithorax complex (BX-C), and the Antennapedia complex. They found that CTCF binds to all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for their functioning. The identified CTCF binding sites precisely map to known insulator elements, such as Mcp, Fab-6, Fab-8, Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. These findings provide important insights into the role of CTCF in insulator function and the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila.CTCF is a DNA-binding protein that contains multiple zinc fingers and is essential for enhancer blocking activity in vertebrate insulators. In Drosophila, CTCF has been identified as an enhancer blocking protein, joining other known insulator proteins such as Su(Hw), Zw5, and BEAF32. Insulators play a crucial role in the genomic organization of transcriptional regulation by preventing inappropriate enhancer-promoter communication and partitioning the genome into separate regulatory domains. In the Bithorax complex (BX-C), CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators, suggesting that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism.The BX-C is a complex regulatory region that controls the expression of the Hox genes, which specify segmental identities along the body axis in Drosophila. The precise expression of the Hox genes in specific parasegments is essential for correct anteroposterior patterning in the thorax and abdomen. The domain hypothesis proposes that each distinct regulatory region or domain contains a modular arrangement of functional elements required for Hox gene expression in a particular parasegment. Boundary elements, located between adjacent domains, restrict the influence of each regulatory region. The evidence for this comes from mutations that disrupt boundary function and from enhancer trap transposon studies, which have generated a map of the BX-C compartmentalised into distinct parasegmental regulatory regions. Three boundaries, Mcp, Fab-7, and Fab-8, have been defined by mutation, and another, Fab-6, has been mapped genetically. Each of the three BX-C boundaries identified by mutational analysis displays insulator function, i.e., they are capable of suppressing reporter gene expression when placed between an enhancer and a promoter in a transgenic insulator assay.In this study, researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation together with genomic microarray (ChIP-array) to investigate in vivo CTCF binding in several regions of the Drosophila genome, including the BX-C. From this analysis, they identified a CTCF binding-site consensus that allows the precise location of CTCF binding sites in these genomic regions. In the BX-C, in addition to the characterized CTCF sites in the Fab-8 boundary element, they demonstrated the presence of CTCF binding sites in the Mcp and Fab-6 boundaries. Furthermore, they identified CTCF binding sites between the regulatory regions bxd/pbx and iab-2, between iab-2 and iab-3, and between iab-3 and iab-4, providing both a localization of the previously postulated boundary regions of “Fab-2, ” “Fab-3, ” and “Fab-4” and a demonstration that these too bind CTCF.The findings from this study provide important insights into the role of CTCF in insulator function and the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila. The identification of CTCF binding sites in the BX-C and their precise location within known insulator elements supports the domain hypothesis of BX-C regulation and the common CTCF-dependent mechanism for insulator function. The study also reveals that CTCF binding sites contain a conserved consensus sequence of approximately 20 bp in length, which is similar to the vertebrate CTCF consensus sequence. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of insulators in gene regulation and development in Drosophila.Keywords: Drosophila,
Ebola viruses, a family of highly lethal zoonotic pathogens, possess longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due to long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) present in their seven transcriptional units. The functions of these UTRs have not been fully understood. In this study, researchers investigated the role of the 5′-UTRs of the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) in translation using reporter assays. They found that the 5′-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function but differentially regulate cap-dependent translation. The 5′-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L 5′-UTR, which is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), was found to initiate translation, suppress pORF translation in a position-dependent manner, and maintain translation of the L pORF under conditions of eIF2α phosphorylation. These findings suggest that the uAUG in the EBOV L mRNA regulates polymerase expression in response to cellular stress and is required for optimal virus replication. Additionally, mutating the L uAUG in a recombinant EBOV resulted in attenuated virus growth and decreased viral RNA synthesis, highlighting the importance of this mechanism in virus replication and identifying a potential therapeutic target.
Rabies is a fatal viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals, including dogs. The disease presents in two forms: furious and paralytic. While the furious form is characterized by aggression and hyperactivity, the paralytic form is marked by muscle weakness and paralysis. Previous studies have suggested that the furious form of rabies may spread more rapidly through the brain than the paralytic form. In this study, researchers analyzed the spread of rabies virus in the brains and spinal cords of five furious and five paralytic dogs that were sacrificed shortly after the onset of symptoms. They found that the amount of rabies antigen in neuronal cell processes was lower in the rostral direction, following the pattern of antigen in neuronal cell bodies. However, there was a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, suggesting that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form. The researchers also found that the amount of rabies antigen in cell processes was greater in the furious form than in the paralytic form, even when comparing neurons with similar amounts of antigen, similar percentages of involved neurons, and anatomic levels with 100% positive neurons. These findings suggest that the slower intracellular transport of the virus in the paralytic form may result in slower viral propagation. The researchers propose that this difference could be due to host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, possibly mediated by cytokines. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the differences between the furious and paralytic forms of rabies.Keywords: rabies, nervous system, viral propagation, intracellular transport, paralytic form, furious form, neuronal cell processes, cytokines.
14-3-3 proteins play a crucial role in regulating the function of proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, particularly at stalled replication forks. These proteins have been shown to interact with the nuclease Exo1, both in yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, 14-3-3 deficient cells fail to induce Mec1-dependent Exo1 hyperphosphorylation, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects. Additionally, 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. The proposed mechanism involves the regulation of the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress.
Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne disease that causes polyarthritis and rash in humans, primarily in tropical and sub-tropical regions. In northern Europe, it is known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. The hypothesis of a seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks in Sweden is based on reported human cases, but there is a need for a more objective marker to confirm this hypothesis. In this study, researchers collected and analyzed mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden to determine the prevalence of SINV in vector mosquitoes. They found that in 2002, there was a significant increase in SINV infection rates in both enzootic and bridge vector mosquitoes, suggesting that this may be the year of the hypothesized outbreak. The findings provide valuable information for further investigating the mechanisms behind the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks.Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne disease that causes polyarthritis and rash in humans. It is primarily found in tropical and sub-tropical regions, but also occurs in northern Europe, where it is known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. The hypothesis of a seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks in Sweden is based on reported human cases, but there is a need for a more objective marker to confirm this hypothesis.To investigate this, researchers collected vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden during the years before, during, and after the hypothesized 2002 outbreak year. They found that in 2002, there was a significant increase in SINV infection rates in both enzootic and bridge vector mosquitoes, suggesting that this may be the year of the hypothesized outbreak. The findings provide valuable information for further investigating the mechanisms behind the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks.The researchers analyzed the mosquitoes using Bayesian maximum clade credibility and median joining network analysis, and found that all isolates belonged to the SINV genotype I (SINV-I). They also identified the local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years.The findings suggest that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes is the most valuable outbreak marker for further scrutinizing the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks. This information can help authorities inform the public about the risk for mosquito-borne SINV infection and motivate people to use protective measures to reduce the number of mosquito bites and decrease the risk for infection and disease.Keywords: Sindbis virus, mosquito-borne disease, polyarthritis, rash, Sweden, Finland, vector mosquitoes, SINV-I, seven-year cycle, outbreak marker, epidemiology, vector-borne diseases, mosquito surveillance, virus detection.
In the post-genomic era, high-throughput technologies, such as transcriptional profiling by microarrays, have become increasingly popular for identifying genes that are differentially expressed in response to different environmental conditions. However, it is unclear whether differential expression is predictive of functional importance. In this study, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to investigate the interaction between native soil nematodes and soil bacteria. We identified candidate genes regulated in response to different bacteria isolated from grassland nematodes or grassland soils, and many of these genes were predicted to affect metabolism and innate immunity. We then used mutations to inactivate 21 of the identified genes and showed that most contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment. Our findings demonstrate that changes in food source, as can occur in environmental disturbance, can have a large effect on gene expression, with important consequences for fitness. We also used regression analysis to show that for many genes, the degree of differential gene expression between two bacterial environments predicted the magnitude of the effect of the loss of gene function on life history traits in those environments. Overall, our results suggest that examination of differential gene expression in different environments can provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of organismal responses to their environment.Keywords: ecology, gene discovery, gene expression, functional genomics, innate immunity.
Centromeres are essential structures in the genome that connect chromosomes to the cytoskeleton during cell division. While the DNA sequence of centromeres is not crucial for the formation of kinetochores, recent research suggests that RNA transcribed from centromeres plays a role in the epigenetic marking system. In this study, researchers focused on CENPC, a key inner kinetochore protein in maize, and found that its DNA binding is facilitated by a localized region of 122 amino acids. This binding reaction is highly sensitive to single-stranded RNA, and long RNAs with specific characteristics similar to those present on kinetochores in vivo promote CENPC binding to DNA. The removal or replacement of the binding module with an HIV integrase binding domain results in a partial delocalization of CENPC in vivo, suggesting that centromeric RNA helps recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics. This research provides insight into the role of RNA in centromere specification and the self-reinforcing process of kinetochore replication.
Human beings inherit genetic material from both parents, with one set coming from the mother and the other from the father. However, most human genome sequencing initiatives do not distinguish between the paternal and maternal copies of the genome, which can limit our understanding of genetic variations and their impact on health and disease. In a recent study, researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, or determining which nucleotides come from the maternal or paternal copy, using the publicly available "Genome-In-A-Bottle" (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a reference. The methods included laboratory-based assays and purely computational approaches. The results showed that a hybrid approach using population-based phasing, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provided the most accurate and efficient way to phase individual human genomes. The study also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with regions where phasing errors occur, which can help improve future phasing methods. Overall, obtaining phase information is crucial for understanding genetic variations and their impact on health and disease, and the hybrid approach provides a cost-effective and accurate solution for phasing human genomes.
A novel study reveals that sooty mangabeys, a natural host for Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), carry a non-functional CCR5 allele that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. This truncated CCR5 molecule, which is present in 26% of the population, is also found in wild sooty mangabeys in West Africa. Despite the absence of functional CCR5 on their cells, these animals do not show significantly different rates of SIV infection or viral loads compared to those with functional CCR5. The study suggests that SIV relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in SM, which may enable the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility to SIV infection in natural hosts and have implications for understanding HIV infection in humans.
In the animal kingdom, individuals choose their mates based on traits that reflect mate quality. However, the reasons behind why certain traits are used for mate quality assessment and how they reflect it are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the relationship between insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, and female attractiveness in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We found that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells affects female attractiveness, and functional ovaries are required for these effects. Interestingly, manipulations of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness compared to the ovary. Furthermore, all investigated tissue-specific insulin signaling manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity in the corresponding direction, suggesting a link between insulin pathway activity and both attractiveness cues and fecundity. The cues themselves, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded differently to fat body and follicle cell manipulations, indicating independent readouts of the pathway activity from these two tissues. Overall, our findings suggest that female attractiveness results from an apparent connection between attractiveness cues and an organismal state of high fecundity, both of which are created by lowered insulin signaling in the fat body and increased insulin signaling in late follicle cells.In the animal world, mate choice is a crucial decision that affects an individual's fitness. Attractiveness traits are used to assess mate quality, but it is not clear why certain traits are preferred over others. Previous studies have shown that more fecund females tend to be more attractive, but the mechanisms behind this correlation are not well understood. In this study, we focused on the insulin signaling pathway, a central nutrient-sensing pathway, to investigate its role in attractiveness and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster. Insulin signaling affects the female pheromone profile, likely through transcriptional regulation of genes that encode enzymes that synthesize cuticular hydrocarbons. Insulin signaling also influences attractiveness in the dung beetle, but its effects may differ between species. Nutrition and insulin signaling play a significant role in both survival and reproductive output. Nutrient restriction and reduced insulin signaling can extend lifespan but reduce reproductive output, suggesting that flies and beetles may have evolved to evaluate insulin pathway activity as an honest and accurate metric of reproductive potential. In this study, we aimed to dissect the mechanistic links between insulin signaling, reproduction, and attractiveness in Drosophila by investigating tissue-specific insulin signaling effects.Keywords: insulin signaling, Drosophila melanogaster, attractiveness, fecundity, cuticular hydrocarbons, fat body, ovarian follicle cells, pheromones, reproductive system, endocrine physiology, animal models, population biology, zoology, endocrinology, invertebrates, insects, cell biology, ovary, anatomy, entomology, population metrics, insulin, lipids, animal physiology, biochemistry, animal cells, fats, endocrinology, invertebrate physiology, biology and life sciences, cellular types, organisms.
Breast cancer is a complex disease with various subtypes, including triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and Basal-like breast cancers. TNBCs lack the clinical markers estrogen receptor (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are often aggressive and difficult to treat, and are associated with the Basal-like molecular subtype. The Basal-like subtype is characterized by defects in the Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways. In this study, researchers used mouse models to investigate the role of these pathways in breast cancer development. They found that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways was sufficient to suppress physiological cell death during mammary gland involution. Additionally, the inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium led to the development of poorly differentiated tumors with features common in human Brca1-mutated tumors, such as heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. These tumors shared attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, which are two molecular subtypes of triple-negative breast cancers. The findings from this study provide valuable insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of aggressive breast cancers and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.Keywords: breast cancer, triple-negative, Basal-like, Rb, p53, Brca1, mouse models, molecular subtypes, tumor suppressor genes.
Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease, uses a type IV secretion system to translocate effector proteins into host cells to manipulate various cellular processes for infection. One such effector protein, LubX, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets another effector protein, SidH, for degradation. The delayed delivery of LubX to the host cytoplasm leads to the shutdown of SidH at later stages of infection, demonstrating a sophisticated level of coevolution between the bacterium and the host. This is the first evidence of a "metaeffector," a term used to describe an effector protein that regulates the function of another effector within the host cell. This finding highlights the intricate relationship between bacterial pathogens and their hosts, and the importance of understanding the spatiotemporal regulation of effector proteins during infection.
Inferring regulatory interactions and constructing quantitative models of gene regulation using time-series transcriptomics data is a common approach in various fields, including drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. However, the assumptions underlying this approach, such as mRNA abundance being representative of protein concentrations and the gene expression machinery being equally active across different conditions, are often not valid. These assumptions can lead to biased results. In this study, researchers investigated the importance of these assumptions and proposed corrections using a combination of models and experiments. They focused on the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network and measured protein concentrations and global physiological effects using kinetic models of gene expression. The results showed that correcting for these assumptions improved the quality of the models inferred from the data. The approach proposed in this study is broadly applicable when using time-series transcriptome data to learn about the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks. The findings demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.
Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), including Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect over a billion people worldwide, primarily in developing countries. Preventive chemotherapy, which involves administering anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the primary method for controlling STH infections. However, this approach does not prevent reinfection. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. We analyzed 51 studies and found that at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, A. lumbricoides prevalence reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. For T. trichiura, respective reinfection prevalence were 36%, 67%, and 82%. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. To maximize the benefits of preventive chemotherapy, frequent drug administrations are needed. Integrated control approaches, including health education and environmental sanitation, are also necessary to interrupt transmission of STHs. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the determinants of STH reinfection to improve the effectiveness of preventive strategies.Keywords: soil-transmitted helminths, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, preventive chemotherapy, reinfection, systematic review, meta-analysis.
Rabies is a fatal virus that can be prevented through prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but access to this life-saving intervention is often limited, particularly in low-income countries where the burden of rabies is highest. In this study, we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of different PEP vaccination regimens and found that intradermal (ID) administration, which requires smaller volumes of vaccine, can significantly reduce the cost of implementing PEP and mitigate vaccine shortages. We propose financing mechanisms to make PEP more affordable and accessible, including subsidies for those in need and support for rabies control and prevention programs. Switching to ID delivery would not only improve affordability and accessibility for bite victims but also likely reduce human rabies deaths and save healthcare providers money. Our analysis considers the perspectives of both healthcare providers and bite victims under various scenarios and constraints, and offers recommendations for policy formulation and vaccine research.Introduction:Rabies is a fatal virus that can be prevented through prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure. However, life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often not accessible or affordable, especially in low-income countries where the largest burden of rabies falls. This situation contributes to the fact that almost all of the estimated 55,000 annual human rabies deaths occur in Africa and Asia. The WHO-recommended PEP protocol includes immediate wound washing, expeditious administration of rabies vaccine, and, for severe categories of exposure, infiltration of purified rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) in and around the wound. However, RIG is rarely administered in low-income countries due to its high cost and short supply. Therefore, post-exposure vaccination without RIG is the most common intervention. Several factors affect the likelihood of promptly obtaining and completing PEP, including vaccine availability, cost, travel and accommodation costs, and delays caused by shortages. Delays in PEP administration can result in rabies deaths.There has been discussion of the value of intradermal (ID) administration of PEP vaccines, which is more economical because smaller volumes of vaccine are required to elicit an equivalent immune response. However, ID vaccination requires careful handling to prevent bacterial contamination and may lead to practical difficulties in health provider budgeting. All WHO-recommended PEP regimens are safe, immunogenic, and efficacious. Therefore, policy should aim to prevent failures in PEP delivery by preventing vaccine shortages, reducing costs for victims and healthcare providers, and promoting patient compliance to ensure PEP efficacy. The variety of WHO-recommended PEP regimens allows flexibility but can lead to confusion regarding which regimen best meets the needs for a specific setting. Additionally, new regimens are continually being developed that require evaluation prior to implementation.In this study, we provide a framework for comparing the cost-effectiveness of different PEP regimens from the perspective of both healthcare providers and bite victims under a range of scenarios and constraints. We discuss the implications for PEP affordability, availability, and accessibility and offer recommendations for policy formulation and vaccine research.Keywords: public health and epidemiology/health policy, virology/vaccines, evidence-based healthcare/health services research and economics, evidence-based healthcare, infectious diseases/viral infections, public health and epidemiology/health services research and economics, public health and epidemiology/immunization.
Uganda is home to both chronic and acute forms of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), with the acute form traditionally confined to southeast Uganda and the chronic form to the northwest. However, the acute form has been spreading rapidly to new districts, linked to the movement of infected cattle. Cattle act as long-term reservoirs of human-infective T. b. rhodesiense, which shows few signs of morbidity but poses a significant risk to human health. This study aimed to examine the relationship between human T. b. rhodesiense infection and human infective and non-human T. brucei s.l. circulating in cattle at village level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda. The study found that villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness had a higher odds of infection in cattle from those villages compared to non-case villages. Cattle age also had a significant effect on the likelihood of T. brucei s.l. infection within cattle. Additionally, villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness had a significantly higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense in their village cattle herds. A higher than average T. brucei s.l. prevalence in a village herd was also associated with a higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense being detected in a herd. These findings provide important information on the relationship between human infective T. b. rhodesiense and T. brucei s.l. in cattle, which is crucial for understanding the risk posed to the community from animals infected with human pathogens in a village setting.
Dietary restriction (DR) is a well-known intervention that extends lifespan and delays age-related diseases in various species. The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is known to be involved in the longevity phenotypes resulting from DR in flies, yeast, and worms. TOR is a conserved protein kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth factors. Previous studies have shown that HIF-1, a transcription factor complex that plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response, is a target of the TOR pathway in mammalian cells. In this study, we investigated the role of HIF-1 in modulating lifespan extension by DR in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results demonstrate that HIF-1 deficiency extends lifespan, which overlaps with that by inhibition of the RSKS-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the TOR pathway. We find that HIF-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner, as hif-1 loss-of-function mutants extend lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but fail to show lifespan extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminishes the lifespan extension under DR. This deficiency is rescued by tissue-specific expression of egl-9 in specific neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by hif-1 or DR is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress. Our findings demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway.Keywords: dietary restriction, TOR pathway, HIF-1, Caenorhabditis elegans, longevity, ER stress, IRE-1.
Acetogens, bacteria that can convert waste gases like H2 and CO2 into valuable commodity chemicals, have the potential to revolutionize sustainable bioproduction. However, designing advanced strategies for acetogens is currently limited by a lack of understanding of their physiology and the inability to accurately predict their behavior. In this study, researchers reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic and gene expression (ME) model of the acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii, the first of its kind for a Gram-positive bacterium. This model captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways for RNA and protein synthesis. The model's predictions revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens, accurately predicted secretion of multiple fermentation products, and provided insights into the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens. The model also predicted the formation of glycerol, a novel product for C. ljungdahlii, and the changing secretion rates based on different metal availability, opening the window into fermentation optimization. The model's ability to predict the optimal distribution of resources in response to limited metal availability makes it a robust tool for defining how transition metals affect an organism's functional network, addressing the need to bridge chemistry and biology in a systematic way. The insights gained from this model provide opportunities for advanced engineering designs and improved biotechnological outcomes.Keywords: Acetogens, bioproduction, genome-scale model, metabolism, macromolecular synthesis, Clostridium ljungdahlii, energy conservation, metabolic pathways, protein allocation, media composition, fermentation optimization, transition metals, proteome utilization, carbon flux.
The protein CIB1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana by interacting with the cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) protein in response to blue light. CIB1 specifically binds to the non-canonical E-box (CANNTG) sequences in the FT promoter region in vivo, despite having a higher affinity for the canonical E-box (CACGTG) in vitro. This apparent discrepancy is explained by the fact that CIB1 forms heterodimers with other CIB proteins, such as CIB5, which have a higher binding affinity for the non-canonical E-box. CRY2 interacts with CIB1 and CIB5 in response to blue light, and all four CIB proteins, CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5, act redundantly to activate the transcription of FT and promote flowering. The expression of CIB proteins is specifically regulated by blue light, and the heterodimers formed by CIB proteins have a higher binding affinity for the non-canonical E-box in vitro, providing a possible explanation for the in vivo binding preference. Overall, this study sheds light on the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying the interaction between CRY2 and CIB proteins in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana.
 Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a leading cause of foodborne disease and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal kidney disease. EHEC and other enteric pathogens, such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells. These effectors disrupt the normal function of intestinal epithelial cells, promoting diarrheal disease and bacterial transmission. In this study, we identified two T3SS effectors, NleH1 and NleH2, encoded by the E. coli O157:H7 genome, which bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of NF-κB transcriptional complexes. NleH1 and NleH2 bind to the N-terminus of RPS3 in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus. Their binding to RPS3 is independent of kinase activity. NleH1 inhibits RPS3-dependent transcription, while NleH2 stimulates it. We suggest that NleH may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes. Our findings provide insight into how bacterial effectors manipulate host cells and contribute to the pathogenesis of enteric infections.Keywords: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Enteropathogenic E. coli, Type III secretion system, T3SS, Virulence proteins, Effectors, Ribosomal protein S3, NF-κB, Host-pathogen interactions, Innate immunity.
High-altitude regions, such as the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau, have presented unique challenges for human populations due to the reduced oxygen tension caused by decreased barometric pressure. While the physiological adaptations of these populations to high altitude have been studied, the underlying genetic basis remains unknown. In this study, we used a genome scan to identify genes that show evidence of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in the Andean and Tibetan populations. We looked for genomic regions with previously unknown functions related to altitude phenotypes and examined groups of genes involved in oxygen metabolism and sensing. By applying four population genetic statistics, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in the Andean and Tibetan populations separately. Our results suggest that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. The gene EGLN1, which is important in cellular oxygen sensing, shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans, but with different patterns of variation between the two populations. These findings provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.Introduction:High-altitude regions, such as the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau, have presented unique challenges for human populations due to the reduced oxygen tension caused by decreased barometric pressure. These extreme environments have challenged the ability of humans to live and reproduce, requiring physiological acclimatization and/or genetic adaptation. While the physiological differences between high- and low-altitude populations have been well studied, little research has been devoted to the identification of the genes responsible for these differences. The goal of this study was to identify candidate genes for high-altitude adaptation based on signatures of positive selection in Andeans and Tibetans.Background:High-altitude regions, such as the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau, have presented unique challenges for human populations due to the reduced oxygen tension caused by decreased barometric pressure.

Machupo virus (MACV) and Junin virus (JUNV), two closely related arenaviruses, cause Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF) and Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), respectively. Previous research showed that a chimeric MACV expressing the glycoprotein from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) strain of JUNV is fully attenuated in mice and protects against MACV challenge. A single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the glycoprotein (GPC) was found to attenuate JUNV and MACV, but it was genetically unstable and not fully attenuated JUNV. To investigate the role of different domains of Cd#1 GPC in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC, three recombinant rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of MACV GPC with or without the TMD of Cd#1 were generated. All rMACVs exhibited similar growth in cultured cells, but they showed different outcomes in mice. The rMACV expressing only the ectodomain (MCg1) displayed reduced lethality in mice, was detected in brains and spleens, and was associated with tissue inflammation. The rMACVs with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg2 and MCg3) did not cause detectable infection in mice and produced neutralizing antibodies against Cd#1. These findings suggest that each domain of GPC plays an essential role in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC.
A new serological test, the Dengue Early Rapid test, has been developed to detect dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen in human serum, which can improve the diagnostic sensitivity when used in combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test. The test was evaluated in two separate studies in Vietnam and Malaysia, and the results showed that the sensitivity of the Dengue Early Rapid test was 69.2% and 68.9% in Vietnam and Malaysia, respectively, while the specificity was 96% in both studies. When used in combination with the IgM/IgG test, the sensitivity increased to 93.0%. The test can differentiate between antigen and antibody markers, and can extend the window of detection for very early acute samples. The use of dengue NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology can significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and improve the clinical utility of rapid immunochromatographic testing for dengue.
A new study reveals that a bacterial protein called TirS, found in Staphylococcus aureus, can interfere with the immune response in eukaryotic cells by inhibiting Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the NF-κB pathway. This protein, which is part of a novel bacterial invasion mechanism, is carried by a mobile genetic element called SCC that also contains the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance. The expression of TirS is increased by sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid. In a mouse model, skin lesions caused by a S. aureus knockout tirS mutant were more severe than those caused by the wild-type strain, despite similar bacterial loads. The study also found that TirS is associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity, suggesting a role in virulence attenuation through local inflammatory responses. The findings suggest that the ability of S. aureus to carry both TirS and antibiotic resistance genes may provide a selective advantage in the spread and survival of the bacterium.
Protein N-terminal acetylation is a common modification that plays a role in various biological processes, but its function is not well understood. In this study, researchers analyzed the N-termini of proteins extracted from Drosophila cells and identified over 1,200 mature protein N-termini. They found that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans and identified a rule, called the (X) PX rule, that indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation. The researchers applied this strategy to express mutated proteins in cell lines and flies, providing a straightforward method to systematically study the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylation in cells and whole organisms. The (X) PX rule is conserved in lower and higher eukaryotes, suggesting its potential use in studying the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species.
Exosomes, small vesicles released by cells, have been shown to play a role in viral infections by transferring viral and host cellular factors to recipient cells, leading to productive infection. In this study, researchers investigated the role of exosomes in Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. They found that EV71 infection led to increased exosome secretion and the selective packaging of viral RNA and miR-146a into exosomes. The exosomal viral RNA could replicate in a new cell, while the exosomal miR-146a suppressed the type I interferon response in the target cell, facilitating viral replication. Additionally, the study found that IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs) were involved in regulating EV71-induced exosome secretion. In vivo studies showed that exosomal viral RNA accumulated differently in tissues compared to free virus particles. These findings suggest that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which can facilitate exosomal EV71 RNA replication in the recipient cell by suppressing the type I interferon response.
Recent experiments have shown that the interaction between chromatin loops plays a crucial role in determining gene expression variability between cells. However, these findings call for a systematic approach to understand how changes in loop factors affect expression variability. In this study, we present a mechanistic model that maps three fundamental patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of stochastic transcription. Our results reveal that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, while alternating loops have the opposite effect. We also compare the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression and find that the former performs better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise, but this control is distance-dependent and there is a limit loop length beyond which the difference in effect between the two communication forms almost disappears. Our findings support the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis.Introduction:Gene expression is regulated by regulatory elements and their interactions, which can form DNA loops that impact gene transcription and contribute to cell-to-cell variability. Transcription of genes is regulated by promoter-proximal and distal DNA elements, which can be hundreds of kilobases apart. These interactions are essential for many cellular functions and have been identified as a key factor underlying phenotypic variability in genetically identical cells. In eukaryotic genomes, enhancers can be located far from the promoter they regulate, and the intervening DNA can contain other promoters and enhancers. Enhancers activate promoters by directly contacting binding sites for transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes via DNA looping. The interactions between DNA elements can either assist enhancer-promoter looping by bringing the enhancer and promoter closer together or interfere with enhancer-promoter looping by placing them in separate loop domains. DNA elements may form chromatin loops in different manners, such as promoter-tethering elements in Drosophila that allow activation by specific enhancers over long distances.Previous studies have shown that DNA looping can maintain a stable lysogenic state, speed up the search process, enhance lysogenic CI transcription, increase the range of bistability, and enhance or suppress transcriptional noise depending on conditions. However, these studies have focused on single looping and treated the looping mechanism as a local role. Recent chromatin capture technologies, such as Chromosome Conformation Capture, have shown that enhancers and promoters are connected in a highly complex network of DNA-looping interactions. Long-range gene regulation in eukaryotic cells involves spatial interactions between transcriptional elements, with intervening chromatin looping out.In this study, we develop a stochastic model that maps connection patterns between interacting DNA loops into a multistate model of gene expression. We show that nested loops promote gene expression but reduce expression noise, while alternating loops reduce the mean expression level but enlarge the noise, compared to side-by-side loops, in the absence of communication form consideration. In the presence of communication form consideration, we find that the facilitated-tracking mechanism performs better than the direct looping mechanism in enhancing (or reducing) expression and reducing (or enlarging) noise, depending on connection patterns. The effects of controlling expression and tuning noise are distance-dependent, remarkable for moderate loop lengths. Additionally, we find that there is a limit loop length such that the difference in effect between the two communication forms almost disappears. Our results suggest that living organisms or cells use the facilitated-tracking mechanism to deal with information about their environments.Keywords: gene regulation, signal processing, binomials, messenger RNA, noise reduction, DNA transcription, mathematics, algebra, DNA, epigenetics, chromatin, polynomials, chromosome biology, gene expression, biochemistry, RNA, enhancer elements, cell biology, nucleic acids, genetics, biology and life sciences, physical sciences.
Predicting the behavior of large gene transcription networks is a significant challenge in systems and synthetic biology, as modules can exhibit context-dependent behavior due to retroactivity. Retroactivity is a phenomenon similar to feedback that influences the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules. In this study, we present an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. We define three retroactivity matrices - internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity - to describe a module's key properties, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters and the modules' topology. These matrices allow us to accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an interconnected network of modules. We illustrate the implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs and provide a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be used to assess the modularity of natural networks and establish design guidelines for minimizing retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.Introduction:Gene transcription networks are typically modeled as the interconnection of fundamental building blocks called transcriptional components. Each component takes a set of transcription factors (TFs) as inputs and produces a single TF as an output. The input TFs bind to promoter sites in the transcriptional component, regulating the production of the output TF through the process of gene expression. In this study, we focus on the dynamics of gene transcription networks, specifically on the impact of retroactivity on the behavior of modules when connected to other modules.Retroactivity is a phenomenon that arises when a module's behavior changes upon connection to other modules. It is a significant challenge in predicting the dynamic behavior of large networks, as it is context-dependent and can lead to unexpected outcomes. In this study, we present an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. We define three retroactivity matrices - internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity - to describe a module's key properties, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters and the modules' topology.Internal retroactivity quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on an isolated module's dynamics. Scaling retroactivity establishes how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules. Mixing retroactivity describes the effect of intermodular connections on the input and output of a module. These matrices allow us to accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules.We illustrate the implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. We also provide a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be employed both to evaluate the extent of modularity in natural networks and to establish design guidelines for minimizing retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.In the following sections, we first introduce the standard mechanistic model for gene transcription networks and define the concepts of modules, interconnected modules, and retroactivity. We then present the three retroactivity matrices and illustrate their implications on the behavior of recurrent network motifs. Finally, we discuss the quantitative metric for evaluating the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules.Keywords: systems biology, synthetic biology, gene transcription networks, retroactivity, internal retroactivity, scaling retroactivity, mixing retroactivity, network motifs, modularity, design guidelines.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common and deadly form of lung cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of only 1% for advanced stages. For patients with resectable NSCLC, the choice of preoperative chemotherapy is crucial for eliminating micrometastasis and improving operability. In this study, a mechanistic model was used to estimate the cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens for NSCLC patients. The model takes into account cancer-related mechanisms such as uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. The methodology uses tumor volumetric data at two time points and considers the effect of tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. The results showed that the volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis are key features for more accurate estimates. The methodology was applied to the retrospective data of 13 NSCLC patients who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The model provides a quantitative framework for estimating the in-vivo cell-killing ability of chemotherapies, and correlation studies of such estimates with the molecular profile of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
In the field of neuroscience, understanding the mechanisms behind psychomotor retardation, a condition characterized by motor and cognitive impairments, remains a complex and ongoing challenge. One specific form of this disorder, Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), is an X-linked condition that results in severe intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, spastic paraplegia, and disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. AHDS is linked to mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, which is responsible for transporting TH into cells.To investigate the underlying causes of AHDS, researchers have studied MCT8 knockout mice, but these animals did not exhibit the neurological and behavioral symptoms seen in human patients. To address this gap in knowledge, researchers generated an MCT8 knockout zebrafish using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated targeted gene editing. The elimination of MCT8 led to decreased TH receptor expression and neurological and behavioral deficiencies in the zebrafish larvae.High-throughput behavioral assays revealed that mct8−/− larvae exhibited reduced locomotor activity, altered response to external light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. These deficiencies were associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in live mct8−/− larvae revealed a reduction in filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons.These findings suggest that MCT8 plays a crucial role in neural circuit assembly, ultimately mediating sensory and motor control of behavioral performance. Additionally, the researchers propose that the administration of TH analogs early during embryo development could specifically reduce neurological damage in AHDS patients. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of AHDS and offers potential therapeutic approaches for this debilitating condition.
Subdividing a population into smaller demes can help accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys or plateaus in a rugged fitness landscape, according to a new study. The research, which uses a minimal model that includes only population subdivision and global migration, shows that the fastest deme drives the crossing process and that isolated demes must be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly speed up the process. The study provides analytical expressions for the conditions under which valley or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is as fast as that of its fastest deme, and verifies the predictions through stochastic simulations. The results demonstrate that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus over a wide range of parameters, and sheds light on the quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur. The findings have implications for understanding the role of population structure in evolution and inferring fitness landscape structure from evolution experiments.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a crucial structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, responsible for regulating the transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope. The mechanism of how this happens is still not fully understood, but it is believed that hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and FG repeat domains play a central role. In this study, researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure to better understand the transport process. The model predicts that a cargo-complex passes through the NPC in about 2.6 milliseconds and is primarily attached to the channel wall, interacting with the FG-layer. The hydrophobic interaction between kap and FG repeats is dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. The model also suggests that cytoplasmic filaments, which form a selectivity barrier, are essential for the NPC's selectivity. The researchers plan to use this model to examine different hypotheses about transport and investigate how various factors, such as molecular size and shape, affect the process.The NPC is a complex structure composed of about 30 distinct proteins, collectively called nucleoporins. These proteins play important roles in regulating transcription and protecting the genetic material of eukaryotic cells, and their dysfunction can lead to various diseases. The NPC is about 44 MDa and 60 MDa in size and dimensions, and it acts as a freeway for passive diffusion of molecules smaller than 5 nm in diameter while actively controlling and facilitating the transport of larger cargos up to about 39-40 nm. Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) happens in a channel about 50 nm wide and in a millisecond time scale in vivo. The small size and compactness of the NPC make it difficult to study, and current imaging techniques fail to capture the time and spatial resolution necessary to understand NCT. Coarse-grained models, which lose atomic details to obtain computational feasibility, are the best alternative for studying the NPC in detail. The researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the unbiased functional state of the NPC and used it to examine different hypotheses about transport and investigate how various factors alter transport.
Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium that can cause a range of infections, including persistent infections through the formation of biofilms on the skin and mucosal surfaces of mammals. These biofilms are complex communities encased in a protective matrix, making them resistant to host immune response and antibiotics. In this study, researchers discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of S. aureus biofilms. These fibers are made up of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs), which have amyloid-like properties. Mutants unable to produce PSMs were found to have susceptible biofilms that could be easily disassembled by enzymes and mechanical stress. Previous research suggested that PSMs have biofilm-dispersing activity when in their soluble form, but the aggregation of these peptides into amyloid fibers changes their biological role in biofilms. This discovery could lead to new approaches in treating persistent biofilm-associated infections.
The Type II Secretion System (T2SS) is a molecular machine that enables bacteria to secrete fully-folded proteins across their outer membrane. A crucial component of this machinery is the secretin, an integral outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. In this study, we identified three distinct forms of T2SSs based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. Two of these, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, were further analyzed and found to have different pilotins that mediate their transport and assembly into the outer membrane. We determined the crystal structure of the novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae, revealing convergent evolution as AspS is functionally equivalent to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria but structurally unrelated. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, enhances the kinetics of secretin assembly, and is found in all species of Vibrio as well as a few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, a mostly saprophytic bacterium, can cause the serious disease melioidosis in humans. Despite proper diagnosis and treatment, mortality rates for melioidosis remain high, ranging from 20% in Northern Australia to over 40% in Thailand. Surprisingly little is known about how B. pseudomallei infects, invades, and survives within its hosts, and even less is known about the role of critical nutrients such as iron in its pathogenesis. Previous assumptions that B. pseudomallei uses common iron-acquisition systems, such as siderophores, have been challenged by the discovery of a clinical isolate carrying a large chromosomal deletion missing the entire malleobactin gene cluster encoding the bacterium's major high-affinity siderophore. This finding suggests that other iron-acquisition systems may contribute to virulence. In this study, researchers deleted the major siderophore malleobactin and pyochelin gene clusters in strain 1710b and found a residual siderophore activity unrelated to other known Burkholderia siderophores. They also found that hemin uptake loci hmu and hem are required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, respectively. Prolonged incubation of a hmu hem mutant in hemoglobin-containing minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin, suggesting alternate pathways for utilization of these two host iron sources. Lactoferrin utilization was dependent on malleobactin but not pyochelin synthesis and/or uptake. A mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model, suggesting that B. pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth.
In a study conducted in Uganda, researchers examined the effects of praziquantel treatment of Schistosoma mansoni during pregnancy on the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at the age of five years. The study involved 1343 children, of whom 32 (2.4%) had S. mansoni infection based on a single stool sample. The infection prevalence did not differ between children of treated or untreated mothers. However, cytokine (IFNγ, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) and antibody (IgG1, Ig4, and IgE) responses to SWA and SEA, as well as FoxP3 expression, were higher among infected than uninfected children. Praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni during pregnancy had no significant effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to SWA, which were higher in offspring of women who received praziquantel during pregnancy. The study found no evidence that maternal S. mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy influenced the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection or effector immune response to S. mansoni infection among offspring at age five years. However, the observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA suggest that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis, which could have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.
Hox proteins are a group of transcription factors that play crucial roles in controlling morphogenesis along the anterior-posterior axis of animals. They regulate distinct sets of target genes, often in a highly localized manner, to ensure proper pattern formation and cell diversification. It has been suggested that Hox proteins cooperate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their target genes in a context-specific manner. In this study, we focus on the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) in Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. This finding suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements (HREs) could be responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets. Therefore, a large number of transcription factors are likely to be directly involved in Hox target gene regulation in vivo.Introduction:Hox genes are essential for controlling morphogenesis along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of animals, from fruit flies to humans [1-3]. They code for transcription factors that regulate a large number of downstream genes, including genes involved in terminal differentiation and morphology [3]. Hox genes are expressed in broad and partially overlapping domains along the AP axis, and their constant and simultaneous activity within hundreds of cells is required throughout development [1]. Despite being active in a large number of cells, Hox proteins affect target gene expression in precisely defined sub-domains in the animal [9-15]. In some cases, the regulation of a Hox target gene can be limited to a single cell [16]. Moreover, some downstream genes can be activated and repressed by the same Hox protein depending on the tissue or developmental stage [8, 11, 17]. This context dependency allows a single Hox protein to affect distinct sets of target genes in the same cells during the course of development [8, 11, 17]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal precision of Hox target gene regulation are poorly understood, largely due to our limited knowledge of the design and function of Hox-dependent enhancers and promoters and their interaction with the regulatory environment.In Drosophila melanogaster, the wingless (wg) gene is a well-studied Hox target gene, and its expression is dependent on the Hox protein Abd-A and the Dpp/TGF-β signaling pathway [11]. Two transcriptional effectors of the Dpp/TGF-β pathway, Mad and Creb, have been shown to mediate the Dpp response on the wg enhancer, suggesting they work in concert with Abd-A [11]. Recently, Medea (Med) and another effector of the Dpp/TGF-β pathway, Med, have been found to collaborate with the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) to repress transcription of the Hox target gene spalt major (sal) in the haltere by independently interacting with adjacent Mad/Med and Ubx binding sites in a small sal enhancer [18]. Additionally, Engrailed (En) and Sloppy paired 1 (Slp1) have been shown to assist the Hox proteins Ubx and Abd-A in repressing Distal-less (Dll) expression in the abdomen of Drosophila embryos by occupying their identified binding sites in a minimal Dll enhancer [10].Another well-studied direct Hox target gene in Drosophila is the apoptosis gene rpr, which is activated by the Hox protein Dfd in the anterior part of the maxillary segment through four binding sites located in the rpr-4S3 regulatory fragment [13]. Since Dfd is active throughout the maxillary segment, whereas rpr RNA is found only locally [19], it seemed likely that additional factors contribute to region-specific Dfd-dependent rpr expression.Results:We find that eight transcriptional regulators, with diverse roles in patterning or differentiation processes, co-operate with Dfd in the regulation of rpr. Within their spatially restricted expression domains, these regulators are recruited to a minimal rpr enhancer through specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences and act together with Dfd to regulate rpr
In this study, researchers developed a computational model to better understand the complex antiproliferative response of human ovarian cancer cells to X-ray treatment. The model combined time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data to render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during and after treatment. The effects of X-ray exposure were modeled using modules describing the functional activity of the main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase of the cell cycle. The researchers used a framework modeling environment to apply different types of modules in each phase and test the models at the appropriate complexity level. The final model provided the first in silico rendering of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, providing separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. This approach reconciled known effects of ionizing radiations and provided new insights into the complex response of cancer cells to X-ray treatment.
Bacteria acquire new DNA through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which increases genetic diversity and helps them adapt to new environments. However, the incorporation of foreign DNA can disrupt the regulation of the bacterial core genome, leading to a fitness cost. The H-NS protein is a global regulator that helps bacteria control the expression of foreign DNA. It targets both core and HGT genes, but the interaction between H-NS and HGT DNA is not well understood. In this study, we provide evidence that H-NS discriminates and differentially modulates core and HGT DNA. The plasmid R27-encoded H-NS protein selectively silences HGT genes, while chromosomal H-NS regulates core genes. This differential regulation requires the helper protein Hha. Tight silencing of HGT DNA is accomplished by H-NS-Hha complexes. Core genes are modulated by H-NS homologmers. The presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have only been isolated from members of this family. The H-NS system in enteric bacteria presents unique evolutionary features, and the capacity to selectively discriminate between core and HGT DNA may help these bacteria maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent state, giving them a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
A new study examines the development of neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in women who were superinfected with HIV-1, which is defined as sequential infections from different source partners. Previous research has shown that superinfection can lead to a broader and more potent Nab response compared to single infection, but it is unclear if this also impacts epitope specificity. The study analyzed plasma samples from 21 Kenyan women who were collectively exposed to HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D and superinfected after a median time of 1.07 years following initial infection. The researchers focused on four main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope, including the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. Using standard epitope mapping techniques, the study found that superinfection did not induce a dominant Nab response to any one of these epitopes in the 21 women. Additionally, computational sera delineation analyses suggested that 20 of the 21 superinfected women's Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These findings support the idea that superinfection with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, which could provide support for vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs.
Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) have gained popularity for analyzing population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies. However, with the increasing number of LMM methods and software packages, it is important to understand their differences and performance. In this study, we compared the performance of several LMM approaches, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, and MMM, using a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families. We investigated the sensitivity of these methods to user-chosen options and their ability to control genome-wide error rates for both real and simulated phenotypes. We also compared the LMM results to traditional family-based association tests and alternative approaches. Our results showed strong concordance between the LMM approaches and high correlation with alternative approaches, except for transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. Overall, LMM approaches performed well and the choice of precise implementation cannot be based on power or type I error considerations but on factors such as speed and ease-of-use.
In the brain, neurons work together in temporary associations to form neural networks that underlie memory and behavior. However, it's unclear how these associations form and how they can be identified. In this study, researchers recorded local field potential (LFP) activity in the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex. They found that when the combined activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a certain threshold, its activity pattern, as reflected in the LFP, spreads to other cortex sites without distortion through fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, called coherence potentials, last for hundreds of milliseconds and allow for the lossless spread of temporal and amplitude information. Coherence potentials provide a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and help identify specific associations. This nonlinear behavior is similar to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.
Polarized growth in cells is essential for maintaining the structure and function of various tissues, including the intestinal epithelium and neurons. Polarized growth is maintained by both exocytosis, which transports membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, and endocytosis, which retrieves these components before they can diffuse away. While functional links between these two transport pathways have been established, they are generally considered separate events. However, new research suggests that the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p plays a role in both polarized exocytosis and cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocytosis.Using live cell imaging, in vitro protein binding assays, and in vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assays, researchers have shown that Sec4p binds to Las17/Bee1p (yeast Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein [WASp]) in a complex with Sla1p and Sla2p during actin patch assembly. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, while the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization established that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation.These results support a model in which Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis. Activated Sec4p then promotes actin polymerization and triggers compensatory endocytosis, which controls surface expansion and kinetically refines cell polarization. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the coordination of exocytosis and endocytosis in cells.
Miltefosine, a drug originally developed for cancer treatment, has shown promising results against Schistosoma parasites, including Schistosoma mansoni. In this study, researchers investigated how miltefosine affects the surface antigens of S. mansoni adult worms in vitro. They found that miltefosine treatment led to the exposure of antigens on the worm surface, as evidenced by strong immunofluorescence and western immunoblotting. Four proteins were identified through mass spectrometry, including fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, and alkaline phosphatase. These proteins were also found to bind to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induce immune agglutination, suggesting a role in immune protection. This study reveals a novel mode of action for miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent and highlights the potential of using antibodies against these antigens to increase the drug's efficacy and potentially prevent re-infection. The findings provide insight into the immune-dependent mechanism of miltefosine and suggest that these antigens could be valuable targets for intervention and vaccine development.
Neurons, the fundamental building blocks of the nervous system, have distinct molecular compositions and functional properties in their axons and dendrites. While much is known about the transport of proteins to dendrites, the mechanisms that mediate the polarized targeting of neuronal proteins are still largely unknown. In this study, researchers have discovered that Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor protein, plays a crucial role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. By engineering non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myosin VI, the researchers found that these proteins became highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Disruption of Myosin VI function or expression led to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myosin VI achieves this axonal enrichment, at least in part, by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that has been shown to underlie the localization of many axonal proteins. Additionally, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI was found to be concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, suggesting its potential use as a tool for probing circuit structure and function. Overall, these findings demonstrate that myosins help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, contributing to the proper electrical signaling in neurons.
The idea that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems has long been a topic of debate in ecology. However, recent research challenges this assumption, suggesting that equilibrium feasibility, a key assumption in local stability criteria, may not be granted in complex systems. In this study, the authors provide analytical results and simulations that show that equilibrium feasibility disappears in species-rich systems. They also find that the dynamical behavior of ecologically-inspired networks is different and richer than that of unstructured systems. The authors suggest that a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.The consensus that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems has been a long-standing belief in ecology, with the argument being that stability increases with the number of species and interactions due to the presence of multiple paths for energy flow. However, this assumption was not tested until the 1970s when it was shown that large, random systems may be unstable. May's seminal work in the 1970s showed that large and random ecosystems are inherently unstable, but it assumed that equilibria were feasible, or achievable, without further analysis.The authors of this study investigate the question of equilibrium feasibility and its relationship to complexity. They find that the probability of observing a feasible equilibrium decreases exponentially towards zero as the size of the network grows. However, they also find that with weak interactions, non-trivial feasible equilibria are found only in ecologically-inspired systems. The authors suggest that a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the stability of complex ecological systems and the role of interaction strength and network architecture in shaping ecosystem dynamics. The authors suggest that their results provide a foundation for future research on the relationship between complexity and stability in ecological systems.Keywords: ecology, ecosystem stability, equilibrium feasibility, interaction strength, network architecture, complexity, food webs, stability criteria, mathematical modeling, ecological systems.
Vibrio cholerae is a bacterium that causes cholera in humans and colonizes both marine chitinous exoskeletons and the human gastrointestinal tract. The bacterium uses a protein called GlcNAc binding protein A (GbpA) to attach to both chitin and mucin, but the mechanism of this attachment was unknown. Through structural studies, we have determined that GbpA has an elongated four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. We also found that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides and that domains 1 and 4 interact with chitin in vitro and are crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Domains 2 and 3 bind to the V. cholerae surface. Mouse virulence assays show that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization. These findings explain how GbpA provides structural and functional modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons.Introduction:Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes cholera in humans and is present in over 100,000 reported cases per year, with many more unreported cases. It is classified into more than 200 serogroups, with only O1 and O139 possessing epidemic potential. V. cholerae survives in the intestine by adhering to and colonizing cell surfaces. In aquatic environments, attachment to organisms like fish, crustacea, and algae provides nutrients and a competitive advantage. V. cholerae uses different genes and recognition molecules for attachment in aquatic environments compared to intestinal colonization. For example, plankton surface colonization is more dependent on the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA). Recent studies suggest that Vibrio cholerae secretes a protein, GlcNAc binding protein A (GbpA), that mediates adhesion in both aquatic environments and to human intestinal cells. GbpA binds to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-containing carbohydrates, such as chitin, and is secreted by the type 2 secretion system. In addition to chitin, GbpA has been shown to bind to mucins, which also contain GlcNAc as part of their O-linked glycans. The importance of GbpA for bacterial colonization has been demonstrated for the O395 and N16961 Vibrio cholerae strains. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of GbpA function as a colonization factor using a combination of approaches.First, we determined the three-dimensional structure of GbpA using a combination of X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering, revealing an unusual, elongated four-domain fold. Two domains appear to be structurally similar to known chitin binding modules, and we show these domains to be responsible for the ability of GbpA to bind chitin. The other two domains possess distant structural homology to bacterial pili binding proteins and serve to bind the V. cholerae surface. Finally, complementation studies with truncated forms of GbpA identify the domains responsible for mucin binding and virulence in a V. cholerae mouse infection model.Keywords: biomacromolecule-ligand interactions, macromolecular assemblies, microbial pathogens, biology, microbiology, host-pathogen interaction, biophysics, bacterial pathogens.
Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to activate the transcription regulator nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which reprograms cellular gene expression and has been linked to the antiviral activity of several viruses, including Marburg virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and Dengue virus. The impact of Nrf2 activation on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has not been explored. In this study, we discovered that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. This effect is mediated through Nrf2, as shown by a decrease in HIV infectivity following Nrf2 depletion using siRNA. SFN blocks HIV infection after entry but before the formation of 2-LTR circles, and it does not induce the expression of known cellular antiviral proteins such as SAMHD1 and MX2. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which Nrf2 can potently block HIV infection.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions of people in Central and South America and there is a need for new drugs to treat the chronic stage of the disease, which currently has no effective treatment. In this study, researchers used a whole cell-based assay to screen a library of 2000 compounds against T. cruzi, resulting in the identification of three compounds, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, with high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells. These compounds have different mechanisms of action against intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes, with CX1 showing strong trypanocidal activity, which is essential for the development of drugs against the chronic stage of Chagas disease. The three compounds also show activity against intracellular T. cruzi from the Y strain and related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. The study provides new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, with IC50 values that are approximately 100 times lower than those of the current medicines.
Bistability is a crucial property of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that plays a role in various essential biological functions, such as cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. However, identifying the network topologies that exhibit bistability is a significant challenge due to the vast number of possible GRNs. In this study, researchers used chemical reaction network theory to systematically survey over 40,000 simple networks formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. They found that approximately 90% of these GRN models exhibit bistability, including several circuits that do not contain typical TF cooperativity. The researchers identified eleven minimal bistable networks, which are bistable networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks. The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies suggests that switch-like behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not easily lost through network evolution. The findings from this study demonstrate the relevance of applying CRNT (Chemical Reaction Network Theory) to bistable network identification in real biological systems. By integrating protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the researchers identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion. This study highlights the importance of parameter-free modeling in simplifying the study of complex regulatory networks, understanding network evolution, and designing new synthetic biological circuits.Keywords: Systems biology, Biochemical simulations, Mathematics, Theoretical biology, Applied mathematics, Regulatory networks, Biology, Computational biology, Genetics and genomics.
Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms that can lead to lymphedema and elephantiasis. While the exact mechanisms of how the parasites cause these conditions are not fully understood, it is known that they can alter the structure and function of the lymphatic system. In a recent study, researchers investigated how filarial parasites and their antigens affect human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. They found that live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures. Additionally, serum from infected patients and those with chronic lymphatic obstruction led to increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. The differentiation of LECs into tube-like networks was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and decreased Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases. Comparison of global gene expression in LECs exposed to live parasites revealed that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways, which decreased trans-endothelial transport. These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology of lymphatic filariasis.
Xanthomonas bacteria use transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) to manipulate plant genes and support bacterial virulence. TALEs have a unique DNA-binding domain made up of tandem repeats, each with repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs) that determine target specificity. In this study, a new approach called PrediTALE was developed to predict TALE targets, taking into account recent findings on TALE targeting, such as frame-shift binding and flexible strand orientation. PrediTALE outperforms previous approaches and identifies several novel putative virulence targets. However, some TALEs were found to be orphan TALEs, as no target genes were predicted for them. It is suggested that incomplete gene annotations may be the reason for this, and genome-wide scans for target boxes are proposed as a solution. PrediTALE can recover known targets from promoterome-wide scans and detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.
Bacteria, like Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, are known to evolve new gene networks to adapt to new niches, including pathogenic interactions with host organisms. One example of this is the DNA binding protein OmpR, which is identical between the two species but has different regulatory specializations. In S. Typhimurium, OmpR expression is induced by acidic pH, while in E. coli, it is not. This difference is due to variations in the promoter regions of the ompR genes and the ability of OmpR to bind to DNA more effectively when it is in a relaxed state, which occurs in S. Typhimurium under acidic conditions. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimimurium overlaps that of E. coli at only 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes, some of which are virulence genes that E. coli does not have. OmpR binds to its genomic targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, allowing it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress. The lack of a strong nucleotide sequence consensus for OmpR binding sites suggests that its ability to recruit new genes to its regulon arises from its modest requirements for specificity in its DNA targets and its preference for relaxed DNA. This flexibility allows OmpR to play a role in the evolution of gene regulatory networks in response to environmental changes.
Two-component signaling systems are crucial for bacteria, Archaea, and plants to adapt to changing environments. These systems typically involve a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue in a Receiver (REC) domain. However, some REC domains lack this phosphorylatable Asp residue, and it is unclear how many of these divergent REC domains exist, what their functional roles are, and how they are regulated. In this study, we compiled all deposited REC domains missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue, which we renamed as Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains. Our analysis reveals that ALRs are surprisingly common and are enriched for rare effector outputs. The available ALR atomic structures, combined with structural, biochemical, and genetic data of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. This work defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains.
The bacterial replication process is driven by the DnaA protein, which cycles between the active ATP-bound form and the inactive ADP-bound form. It has been suggested that DnaA also controls the initiation frequency, but new research suggests otherwise. In this study, cells with a surplus of ATP-DnaA showed no changes in the timing of replication. The findings suggest that while ATP-DnaA is the motor that drives the initiation process, other factors are required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. The study also investigated the roles of datA-dependent DnaA inactivation (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA. Loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein, indicating that compromised cell cycle machines perform in a less robust manner.
The rat demyelination (dmy) mutation is a unique model for studying myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS) as it causes severe myelin breakdown after myelination is complete. Through positional cloning, we identified a G-to-A transition in the Mrs2 gene, which resulted in a novel splice acceptor site and functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA confirmed our findings. Mrs2 encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of both yeast and human cells. Dmy/dmy rats exhibit major mitochondrial deficits, including a markedly elevated lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, a 60% reduction in ATP, and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed that MRS2 is dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. These findings suggest that dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for myelin maintenance.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, affecting 12 million people worldwide. The parasite can cause different clinical forms, with Leishmania amazonensis being a significant agent in Brazil. Understanding how the host immune response affects Leishmania and its virulence is an interesting but rarely studied topic. In this study, we compared the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice to investigate the impact of the host immune system on Leishmania proteins. Nude mice, which lack T cells, may resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, and this study is the first to compare modifications in amastigote proteomes driven by the host immune response. Among the 44 differentially expressed proteins, we identified those related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases, including known Leishmania virulence factors such as OPB and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells may restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. Conversely, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice. Our findings may help identify potential virulence factors and ways to regulate their expression.Introduction:Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases reported every year. The disease can manifest in various clinical forms, with Leishmania amazonensis being a significant agent in Brazil, leading to localized and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The immune response of the host plays a crucial role in determining the clinical outcome of Leishmania infections. However, the effect of the host immune system on Leishmania proteins and virulence is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to compare the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice to investigate the impact of the host immune response on Leishmania proteins.BALB/c mice are susceptible to Leishmania infections and develop a mixed Th1-Th2 response, while nude mice lack T cells and may resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, who are anergic to parasite antigens. Previous studies have shown that the host immune response modulates Leishmania phenotypes, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in L. amazonensis amastigotes. PS exposure is an apoptotic feature that leads to parasite intracellular survival due to inhibition of macrophage inflammatory response. PS exposure is positively correlated with clinical parameters of the human infection and with characteristics of the experimental infection, such as macrophage infection and anti-inflammatory cytokine induction. However, little is known about how the host immune response affects other Leishmania proteins.Proteomics is an efficient method to compare protein profiles, and most studies have focused on abundance or post-translational modifications of proteins in amastigotes and promastigotes of the same Leishmania species, parasites sensitive and resistant to drugs, and proteins from different Leishmania species. However, comparison of proteomes from lesion-derived amastigotes and axenic amastigotes has shown important differences. In this study, we analyzed the proteomes of mouse lesion-derived amastigotes using the protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis with fluorescent labeling (DIGE) and protein identification by mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/ToF) approach. We compared the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice to evaluate the effect of the host immune system on protein expression in Leishmania.Results:We identified 44 differentially expressed proteins between amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice. Among these, we found proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases, including known Leishmania virulence factors such as OPB and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells may restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. Conversely, an isoform of HSP70
A retrospective study was conducted on 498 isolates of the cryptococcal fungus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, collected in Thailand. The majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their source, which was the most common molecular type found in clinical, environmental, and veterinary settings. The study also identified other molecular types, including VNII, VNIV, VGI, and VGII, in smaller numbers. The isolates were analyzed using Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and URA5-RFLP and M13 PCR-fingerprinting methods. The Thai isolates were found to be part of the global cryptococcal population genetic structure, with unique sequence types for C. gattii (ST30) and C. neoformans (ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172, and ST173). The study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. Cryptococcosis, caused by these fungi, is a systemic mycosis that affects a wide range of animals and humans, and is particularly dangerous for individuals with weakened immune systems. The study provides valuable information on the molecular epidemiology of cryptococcosis in Thailand and expands the current understanding of the genetic diversity of Thai isolates.
 Scabies is a common but neglected infectious disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in disadvantaged populations. Current treatments, such as topical agents and oral ivermectin, are insufficient and resistance is emerging. Moxidectin, a promising alternative, was tested in a porcine scabies model, and the results showed that a single oral dose of moxidectin was more effective than two doses of ivermectin. Moxidectin had a longer persistence in plasma and skin, covering the entire mite life cycle, and all MOX-treated pigs were mite-free at day 14, while only 75% of IVM-treated pigs were. These findings suggest that moxidectin could be an effective therapeutic approach for scabies, providing long-lasting efficacy.
Type III interferon (IFNλ) plays a crucial role in host defense against viral pathogens in the respiratory tract, but its role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of IFNλ in the lung during bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that both bacteria induced significant production of IFNλ in the lung, and clearance of these bacteria was significantly increased in IL-28R null mice compared to controls. This improvement in bacterial clearance was associated with reduced lung pathology and a lower ratio of pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells, IFNλ inhibited miR-21 via STAT3, leading to upregulation of PDCD4, a protein known to promote inflammatory signaling. In vivo, 18 hours following infection with either pathogen, miR-21 was significantly reduced and PDCD4 was increased in the lungs of wild type compared to IL-28R null mice. Infection of PDCD4 null mice with USA300 resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production. These findings suggest that during bacterial pneumonia, IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4.Introduction:The interferon (IFN) family consists of three subgroups (types I, II, and III IFN), each with distinct receptors and signaling pathways. Type I IFNs signal through the ubiquitously expressed interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR), while type III IFNs, composed of IL-28A/B and IL-29, signal through the more cell-specific receptor complex of IL-10R2 and IL-28R. Activation of either IFN pathway results in an autocrine signaling network primarily through JAK/STAT signaling and the induction of IFN-dependent gene expression. While type I and type III IFNs activate redundant downstream signaling pathways, their distinct roles depend on the infection site. For example, in the lung, type III IFN is the primary IFN produced by respiratory epithelial cells in response to viral stimulation and is required for clearance of influenza from the airway. Type III IFNs have several immunological effects that could be relevant to bacterial infection, such as upregulation of MHC I and II, induction of NF-κB-dependent cytokine production, and effects on DC maturation and differentiation. Interferon signaling is also linked to the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that can directly influence innate immune signaling. In tumor cells, miR-21 targets the tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), promoting tumor growth and contributing to the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. PDCD4 represses translation of cellular mRNA through its binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). Phosphorylation of PDCD4 by the ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) results in release of eIF4A from PDCD4, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of PDCD4, and enhanced mRNA translation. Inflammatory cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 or 4 activation by decorin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is significantly influenced by expression of miR-21 and PDCD4. Therefore, the pro-inflammatory contribution of PDCD4 to host signaling during bacterial pneumonia could significantly contribute to lung pathology. In this study, we examined the importance of type III IFNs in the innate immune response to two major airway pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia. We found that IFNλ is induced in the course of bacterial airway infection and results in downregulation of the microRNA miR-21, sustained expression of PDCD4, and increased proinflammatory cytokine production. Mice lacking the IFNλ receptor, IL-28R, or PDCD4 had significantly improved clearance of both airway pathogens
A neural network with a single layer using reward-modulated spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) can learn simple foraging tasks. In this study, we expanded on this concept by creating a network with multiple plastic layers. The network utilized both reward-modulated and non-reward-modulated STDP, as well as multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy. The addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing non-rewarded STDP created neurons that responded to specific combinations of inputs, allowing for basic pattern classification. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network was able to learn discrimination between rewarding and punishing patterns, even in the absence of labeled training data. Synaptic noise facilitated trial-and-error learning, helping the network identify effective strategies for task solving. This study suggests that a spiking neuronal network with STDP possesses a critical set of properties necessary to solve complex foraging tasks involving pattern classification and decision making.Introduction:Neural networks inspired by the brain should be capable of performing sophisticated information processing, as the brain itself is deeply multilayered and capable of learning and responding to a changing environment. The visual pathway, for example, involves multiple stages of processing, and the role of reward in learning is still a matter of debate. While reward can influence learning, the extent of its influence is task-dependent. Understanding the cellular mechanisms of learning is crucial for developing models of brain function. Spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) is a promising model of learning at the synaptic level, but it relies on delayed reward signals and dopamine modulation of synaptic tags created by STDP. While some studies have attempted to perform task learning using rewarded STDP, the net increase of synaptic strength across the network can lead to dysfunctional brain activity. To prevent this, various regulatory synaptic mechanisms maintain the distribution of synaptic weights in biological networks. Homeostatic mechanisms and heterosynaptic plasticity are two such regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we built a model containing two plastic layers inspired by the pathways in the mammalian brain responsible for decision making. The first layer uses unsupervised learning to classify inputs, while the second layer, based on rewarded STDP, is responsible for decision making. The network simulates an agent moving through an unknown environment, continuously learning distinct input patterns of food and adjusting synaptic weights controlling its movement according to reward and punishment signals based on the shape of the different configurations of food particles it acquires. We demonstrate that a multilayered network combining rewarded and non-rewarded STDP and synaptic regulatory mechanisms is capable of solving a more complex foraging task involving discrimination between elementary patterns of food than previously reported in networks with only one plastic layer based on rewarded STDP.Keywords: neural networks, learning, reward-modulated spike time dependent plasticity, synaptic plasticity, homeostatic mechanisms, heterosynaptic plasticity, decision making, foraging, pattern classification.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying disease susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases, but the question remains whether individual disease risk can be quantified based on genotype data for personalized prevention and treatment. Previous studies have used limited numbers of confirmed susceptibility loci and simple statistical approaches, resulting in poor performance. In this study, researchers propose using sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers to improve disease risk assessment. They applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to a type 1 diabetes (T1D) GWAS dataset and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 in both datasets. The use of hundreds of markers led to improved performance compared to using only dozens of known susceptibility loci or logistic regression models. The study suggests that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays.
Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects approximately 2 million people annually, with Brazil being one of the most severely affected countries. In this study, we analyzed reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil over a 10-year period using Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models. Our analysis focused on spatial and temporal patterns, and we identified precipitation and socioeconomic proxies as important risk factors for both types of leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (SD: 7,666) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 (SD: 288) for visceral leishmaniasis. Our risk maps identified priority areas for leishmaniasis control efforts, with the highest numbers of infected people predicted in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. These maps and estimates can help decision-makers target interventions to reduce disease incidence.Introduction:Leishmaniasis is a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, which are transmitted by female phlebotomine sandflies. The disease occurs in humans in two clinical forms: cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL). While CL is less severe and causes skin or mucosal lesions, VL can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 350 million people are at risk of leishmaniasis, with approximately 2 million cases and 59,000 deaths annually. In Brazil, the number of reported cases has been increasing, with 560,000 new cases reported between 1990 and 2007. Effective control of leishmaniasis requires reliable maps of the spatial distribution of the disease and the number of affected people, so that treatment and other control interventions can be implemented most cost-effectively. Bayesian geostatistical models have been used to map malaria and neglected tropical diseases, but the large number of locations makes covariance matrix computations challenging. In this study, we analyzed reported incidence data of CL and VL in Brazil using Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models and Bayesian variable selection to determine the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors. Our goal was to produce countrywide high-resolution incidence maps and estimates of the number of infected people at the state level.Methods:We analyzed reported incidence data of CL and VL obtained from the information system for notifiable diseases (ISND) in Brazil during 2001 to 2010. We employed Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to fit the models and perform fast approximate Bayesian inference. Bayesian variable selection was used to determine the most important predictors.Results:For both types of leishmaniasis, precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were identified as important risk factors. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (SD: 7,666) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 (SD: 288) for visceral leishmaniasis. Our risk maps identified priority areas for leishmaniasis control efforts, with the highest numbers of infected people predicted in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, respectively.Discussion:Our study provides countrywide high-resolution incidence maps and estimates of the number of infected people at the state level, which can help decision-makers prioritize intervention areas and optimize resource allocation to render control and elimination efforts most cost-effective. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that identified precipitation and socioeconomic factors as important risk factors for leishmaniasis. Our study extends previous work by providing countrywide estimates and maps, which can be used to inform public health policy and resource allocation.Keywords: Leishmaniasis, Bayesian geostatistical models, Negative binomial models, Integrated nested Laplace approximations, Incidence maps, Risk factors, Brazil.
IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, a process essential for the development of blood cells. IKAROS works in collaboration with the NuRD complex, which is known for its role in gene repression, to promote gene activation. The mechanism by which IKAROS can support transcription activation while being associated with the HDAC-containing NuRD complex is not well understood. In this study, researchers have discovered that NuRD and the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) are assembled in a complex that can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1α), an IKAROS-binding protein and P-TEFb activator, to CDK9. An IKAROS mutant that is unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impedes normal differentiation of IkNULL hematopoietic progenitors. Additionally, the knock-down of the NuRD subunit Mi2 reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and thereby, promotes transcription elongation. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of IKAROS in hematopoiesis and the mechanisms by which it interacts with the NuRD and P-TEFb complexes to regulate gene expression.
Mitochondria, which originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts, have a complex protein import system to transport proteins across their outer membrane. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) is a key component of this system, but its structure and subunit composition vary between different eukaryotic lineages. In this study, researchers analyzed the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a type of mitochondria found in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. They discovered that the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, named TvTOM, forms a translocation channel for hydrogenosomal protein import. TvTOM consists of a highly divergent Tom40-2 protein, which forms three pores, and four tail-anchored proteins, including Tom36 and Tom46 with heat shock protein (Hsp) 20 and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, Tom22-like protein, and Homp19 with no known homology. The results suggest that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor, while receptors for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
A large genome-wide association study was conducted on 19,091 East-Asian women, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, diagnosed with breast cancer and 20,606 healthy controls. The study identified three genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer: rs9485372 near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene on chromosome 6q25.1, rs9383951 in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene, and rs7107217 at 11q24.3. The top SNP, rs9485372, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages of the study, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. The study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus near the TAB2 gene and identifies two possible susceptibility loci in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively. These findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility in East-Asian women.Introduction:Breast cancer is a common malignancy diagnosed among women worldwide, including those in East Asian countries. Genetic factors play a significant role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. In the past two decades, over 1,000 reports have been published on the association between variants in candidate genes and breast cancer risk. However, only a few genetic risk factors have been confirmed for this disease, and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 20 common genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. However, these newly-identified genetic factors, along with known high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, explain less than 30% of the heritability for this cancer. Furthermore, most GWAS were conducted among women of European ancestry, and many of the variants discovered in European-ancestry populations showed only a weak or no association with breast cancer in other ethnic groups. Therefore, GWAS conducted in non-European women are necessary to fully uncover the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility. Herein, we report the results of a large GWAS of breast cancer conducted in East Asian women.Keywords: breast cancer, genetics, genomics, East Asian women, susceptibility loci, TGF-β activated kinase, ESR1 gene, 11q24.3.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are essential for understanding the complex molecular interactions within cells. However, the large amounts of data generated by high-throughput techniques for detecting PPIs come with a high level of noise and incompleteness. In this study, a new technique is presented to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks using a geometric graph model. This approach achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90% and can be used to predict new interactions and guide future experiments. The method was applied to the human PPI network and predicted 251 new interactions, many of which were validated in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. The data and Matlab code implementing the methods are freely available online. The technique is the first to utilize a geometric graph model for assessing the confidence of known interactions and predicting new ones. The geometric graph model is a versatile graph family that can be constructed using different metric spaces, distance norms, and distance parameters. The results suggest that PPI networks are well modeled by low-dimensional geometric random graphs, providing a new approach for denoising PPI data sets and detecting false positives and false negatives.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, which produces the cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin mycolactone. The immune response against this pathogen and the protective mechanisms are not yet fully understood. While advanced BU lesions show an extracellular localization of the acid-fast bacilli, there is evidence for an early intracellular growth phase of M. ulcerans in macrophages. In an experimental mouse model of BU, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was found to be a critical regulator of early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infections. Interferon-γ knockout mice displayed a faster progression of the infection, with faster tissue necrosis, edema formation, and a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This suggests that mice lacking IFN-γ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. These findings support the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be applicable to BU.Introduction:Buruli ulcer (BU) is a progressive skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans), which is primarily found in West African rural communities but has also been reported in other regions. The disease is characterized by the production of the cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin mycolactone, which is essential for bacterial virulence and is highly cytotoxic for various mammalian cell types. Despite the immunosuppressive effects of mycolactone, individuals living in endemic regions frequently develop immune responses against M. ulcerans. The role of the immune system in controlling M. ulcerans infections is not yet fully understood, but cellular, particularly type 1 helper (TH1) cell responses, are believed to be more important than humoral responses. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is critical for host defense against intracellular pathogens, and its role in controlling M. ulcerans infections was investigated in an experimental mouse model.Histopathological analyses of advanced BU lesions have demonstrated a mainly extracellular localization of the acid-fast bacilli, but there is growing evidence for an early intracellular growth phase of M. ulcerans. This has led researchers to investigate whether IFN-γ might play an important role in containing M. ulcerans infections. In this study, the authors found that interferon-γ is indeed a critical regulator of early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infections. Interferon-γ knockout mice displayed a faster progression of the infection, as evidenced by faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and edema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that mice lacking interferon-γ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans.Conclusion:The findings from this study demonstrate a prominent role of interferon-γ in early defense against M. ulcerans infection and support the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the immune response to M. ulcerans and the mechanisms of protective immunity against this intracellular pathogen.Keywords: Buruli ulcer, Mycobacterium ulcerans, interferon-γ, immune defense, intracellular growth, mouse model.
Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, is a major target for vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional mosquito surveillance relies on household larval surveys, but new trapping devices are available that could be more effective and efficient. In this study, we compared the performance of four types of traps - BG-Sentinel, Adultrap, MosquiTRAP, and ovitraps - to the traditional larval survey in five mid-sized cities with different tropical climate regimens. The results showed that all traps, except for ovitraps, were more sensitive than the larval survey in detecting mosquito density variation. Traps tend to plateau at high mosquito densities, but they all agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Temperature, rather than precipitation, was the main driver of mosquito seasonality. All traps, except for ovitraps, performed better than the larval survey in measuring the seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. The choice between traps should also consider their cost and ease-of-use.
Mean-field approximations are commonly used to study large neural networks, but they do not accurately describe the behavior of small networks composed of a few tens of neurons. In this study, we present a novel approach to analyze the dynamics of arbitrarily small neural networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. We find that for strong inhibition, these networks exhibit complex dynamics due to the formation of multiple branching solutions, which is a finite-size effect not observed in mean-field approximations. This spontaneous symmetry-breaking allows mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, potentially reducing the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing. Our approach is analytically tractable and can be applied to networks of arbitrary size, providing new insights into the behavior of mesoscopic cortical circuits.
A major challenge in biology is understanding how complex tissue shapes arise during growth. Two theories suggest that tissue orientations are specified either through stresses (axiality-based system) or through molecular signalling (polarity-based system). While the axiality-based system has been explored through computational modeling, a polarity-based system called the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework is presented in this study. In the GPT framework, tissue is treated as a continuous material, and polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and are anchored in tissue polarity organizers. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are then specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature. The GPT framework is illustrated through a growing Snapdragon flower model, and it is proposed that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth, a key feature of polarity-based systems, have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes. The GPT framework provides a valuable tool for understanding morphogenesis and may also be useful for modeling animal systems where cell movement is limited.

Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg Anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the combination of eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, and post-axial oligosyndactyly. Homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in BMP antagonism during embryonic development, have been identified in eight unrelated families with OAS. Four of these mutations are nonsense, two are frame-shift, and two are missense, both in the second Thyroglobulin Type-1 (Tg1) domain of the protein. The mouse orthologue, Smoc1, shows site- and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. A targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of Smoc1 in mice results in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly and eye malformations, such as coloboma and cleft palate. The loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for both the limb and eye phenotype in humans and mice. SMOC-1 is one of the two mammalian paralogs of Drosophila Pentagone, an inhibitor of Decapentaplegic. The orthologous gene in Xenopus laevis, Smoc-1, also functions as a BMP antagonist in early embryogenesis.
In the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster, the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell survival, proliferation, and vein patterning. Two Zn-finger transcription factors, Spalt major (Salm) and Spalt-related (Salr), are key players in the Dpp pathway. To understand the genetic control of wing growth and patterning by the Dpp pathway, it is essential to identify the direct targets of Salm and Salr. In this study, we used microarray experiments to compare the expression profile of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs and identified a complex transcription landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins. We found that candidate Salm/Salr targets include genes with both turned-off and positively regulated expression. Loss-of-function analysis of these genes revealed a requirement for wing growth and patterning for a subset of them. The identification of Salm/Salr target genes opens a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing and link the activity of the Dpp pathway to the development of this epithelial tissue.
A new study reveals a form of adaptation in a first-order auditory interneuron (AN2) of crickets, which shifts the stimulus-response curves towards higher stimulus intensities with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. This adaptation reduces the spike responses for low-intensity sounds. The researchers compared the experimental results with two competing hypotheses: infomax and selective coding. Infomax predicts that the neural response curve should maximize the information transmission between the neural representation and the stimulus, while selective coding suggests that background signals should be selectively suppressed. The study found that adaptation actually reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals, and the response curve changes are not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis. The findings suggest that the AN2 neuron in crickets may represent a communication channel optimized for coding the inputs, but further research is needed to fully understand the underlying principles of sensory adaptation in this system.Keywords: neuroscience, theoretical neuroscience, sensory systems, computational biology, computational neuroscience.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, uses a sigma factor called RpoS to regulate gene expression during its tick-to-mammal transmission cycle. While the role of RpoS in the mammalian host has been extensively studied, its contribution to the tick phase of the enzootic cycle has not. In this study, researchers found that RpoS-dependent gene expression is necessary for Borrelia to be transmitted by feeding ticks. RpoS-deficient spirochetes transform into unusual round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal, which can be reversed in vitro by increasing Coenzyme A disulfide reductase levels. The findings suggest that Borrelia defaults to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation when the energetics for transmission are unfavorable.
Two-cysteine peroxiredoxins (mTXNPx) are ubiquitous enzymes that play various roles in cells, including peroxide removal. In Leishmania, which lack catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, the discovery of this family of enzymes provided the molecular basis for peroxide removal. In this study, the functional relevance of mTXNPx in Leishmania infantum was investigated during its life cycle. mTXNPx null mutants were found to be avirulent in a murine model of infection, but this was not due to the lack of the enzyme's peroxidase activity. Instead, it was proposed that mTXNPx functions as a molecular chaperone, as it was able to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro and mtxnpx− were more sensitive to temperature shifts. This finding challenges the paradigm that all trypanosomatid 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrates that these enzymes can impact pathogenicity independently of their peroxidase activity.
Plant polysaccharides are an essential part of the global carbon cycle and human nutrition, and their metabolism by microbes plays a crucial role in various industries. In this study, we present a new method to analyze how microbes, specifically the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans, degrade and metabolize different plant polysaccharides, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. We used a combination of carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening to understand the bacterium's response to these polysaccharides. Our findings reveal that the bacterium prioritizes metabolism of preferred substrates and up-regulates specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. The 56 up-regulated CAZymes were purified and tested for their abilities to bind and cleave plant polysaccharides, and we identified synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms.

Glanders, a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, is a highly infectious disease that can cause severe illness in animals and humans. Although eradicated from many Western countries, glanders has recently re-emerged in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. A recent outbreak of glanders in Bahrain was investigated using high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing of B. mallei isolated from infected horses and a camel. The results revealed that the samples from the Bahrain outbreak separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting the involvement of multiple strains and a complex epidemiological background. The close relationship of the Bahrain and United Arab Emirates (UAE) B. mallei populations suggests repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. The recent emergence of glanders and worldwide horse trading may pose a new risk for human infections.Glanders is a notifiable zoonotic disease that is fatal to both animals and humans. It is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia mallei, which can be transmitted through aerosols and causes invasive, fatal disease in combination with resistance to multiple antibiotics. The disease has been eradicated in many Western countries through large-scale culling of infected animals, but in developing countries, economic and cultural circumstances may hinder culling and enable the persistence of glanders. In recent years, several outbreaks of glanders have occurred in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America.In 2010, an outbreak of glanders occurred in Bahrain, which was initially contained but reoccurred in 2011. More than 6,700 horses and 250 donkeys, representing about 80% of the total horse and donkey population in Bahrain, were screened for glanders using prescribed Complement Fixation Testing (CFT) and an in-house cELISA. Fifty horses and one camel tested positive, and B. mallei was isolated from eight horses and the single, positive camel. Using B. mallei-specific real-time PCR and high-resolution MLVA typing, it was shown that the strain from the camel was genetically closely related to B. mallei strain Dubai 7 that was isolated from a horse during a contained outbreak in the United Arab Emirates in 2004.In this study, various B. mallei isolates from the 2004 UAE outbreak and the 2010–11 Bahrain outbreak were characterized using MLVA and next-generation whole genome sequencing. The results provided evidence that the recent outbreak in Bahrain was caused by two different B. mallei strains, suggesting two independent introductions. The close relationship of the Bahrain and UAE B. mallei populations may be indicative of a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains. The recent emergence of glanders and worldwide horse trading may pose a new risk for human infections.Keywords: bacterial diseases, infectious diseases, veterinary science, veterinary diseases, zoonoses, medicine and health sciences, emerging infectious diseases, medical microbiology, genetics, microbial pathogens, biology and life sciences, microbiology, genomics, molecular biology, microbial genomics.
In the plant world, the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana has been extensively studied for its role in root development and the essential genes involved. However, it remains unclear how applicable these findings are to other plant species, such as Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium). In Brachypodium, a mutation in the TAR2-LIKE (BdTAR2L) gene, which is involved in tryptophan aminotransferase activity, results in a surprising phenotype: elongated seminal roots. This is counterintuitive as reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity is typically associated with reduced auxin levels and root growth. However, in Brachypodium, the mutation leads to elevated auxin levels due to increased expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for auxin biosynthesis. This delicate balance of auxin and ethylene activity is crucial for controlling cell elongation in Brachypodium roots. These findings suggest an alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk in Brachypodium compared to Arabidopsis.Introduction:Roots play a crucial role in plant growth and survival, providing support, water, and nutrients to the shoot, and participating in secondary functions such as hormone biosynthesis and storage of photoassimilates. Root system architecture is determined by developmental and environmental factors, and optimization of root system plasticity is of particular interest in crops to increase their ability to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. The molecular genetic control of root growth and branching has been largely studied in the model system Arabidopsis thaliana, but the findings from this model organism may not be directly applicable to other plant species. In this study, we explore the role of the TAR2-LIKE gene in Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) and its impact on auxin biosynthesis and root growth.Background:Auxin biosynthesis from tryptophan via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) is essential for root formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. This pathway involves two enzyme classes: the TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1) and TAA1-RELATED (TAR) proteins, which catalyze the conversion of tryptophan to IPA; and the family of YUCCA cytochrome P450s, which catalyze the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the major active form of auxin. TAA1/TAR genes were identified through loss-of-function approaches, while YUCCA genes were identified through a gain-of-function approach. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the taa1 mutant displays root growth resistance to the application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid (ACC), a rate-limiting precursor for ethylene biosynthesis, due to reduced auxin biosynthesis, which is normally up-regulated by ethylene through induction of TAA1/TAR gene expression.Findings:We report the isolation and characterization of a Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) mutant in the TAR2-LIKE (BdTAR2L) gene. Unlike the vt2 mutant of maize, which displays severe shoot phenotypes, the Bdtar2l mutant displays only mild shoot phenotypes but dramatic root phenotypes. Surprisingly, these root phenotypes appear to result from upwardly disturbed auxin homeostasis. The Bdtar2l mutant displays elevated auxin levels, which is not due to compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways. Instead, expression of YUCCA genes is increased, suggesting that ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner to confer auxin levels that are sub-optimal for root cell elongation.Conclusion:Our findings reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk as compared to Arabidopsis. These results have implications for understanding the molecular genetic control of root growth and branching in monoc
Researchers have been studying the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes within cells to understand how it impacts gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long and densely packed polymers, and accurately modeling their complex structures and dynamics is a significant challenge. In this study, researchers propose a new strategy for developing efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. This approach accurately accounts for polymer entanglement length and volumic density, allowing for the capture of steady-state structural and dynamical properties while tracking the same dynamics at different coarse-graining levels. The strategy offers a significant power-law gain in numerical efficiency and provides a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes. The researchers apply their formalism to investigate the time evolution of chromosome 3R in Drosophila during one cell cycle and find that a combination of their coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions reproduces experimental data at the chromosome scale and predicts that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.
Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite, replicates within a parasitophorous vacuole that does not fuse with host organelles. To acquire nutrients, the parasite attracts host organelles, such as lipid droplets (LD), to the vacuole. In this study, researchers investigated the role of LD in Toxoplasma's intracellular development. They found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells with low LD or impaired lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. The number of host LD and the expression of LD-associated genes progressively increase until the onset of parasite replication, and the PV is surrounded by host LD. Toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host LD and incorporating them into its own membranes and LD. Exogenous addition of oleic acid stimulates LD biogenesis in the host cell and results in the overaccumulation of neutral lipids inside the parasite. To access LD-derived lipids, Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes within the PV host LD, some of which remain associated with Rab7, forming an intravacuolar network of membranes. Mutant parasites impaired in intravacuolar network formation display diminished capacity for lipid uptake from host LD. Parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV, suggesting a major contribution of the IVN for host LD processing in the PV and lipid content release. The study highlights the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and its capability to scavenge neutral lipids from host LD.
In the development of Drosophila embryos, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis. This process involves a balance between BMP and opposing EGF signaling. In this study, researchers used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq with the Mad and Brinker transcription factors to identify new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. They found that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription, creating a self-regulating network. The researchers also identified key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain and found widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. The findings were incorporated into a model for Mad-dependent activation and discussed in relation to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.The BMP signaling pathway is a conserved developmental process used to regulate various processes, including dorsal-ventral axis patterning in embryos. In Drosophila, a gradient of the BMP signaling molecules Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Screw (Scw) forms to pattern the dorsal ectoderm into dorsal epidermis and amnioserosa fates. The BMP signaling is transduced through the Tkv, Punt, and Saxophone receptor complex, leading to the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the Mothers Against Dpp (Mad) transcription factor (pMad), which then interacts with Medea (Medea) in the nucleus.The researchers used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq with the Mad and Brinker transcription factors to decipher the BMP-responsive transcriptional network underlying differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm during dorsal-ventral axis patterning. They identified multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. Manipulation of EGF signaling levels by loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription. Therefore, the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property in that it establishes a balance between its activity and that of the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning.In terms of BMP-dependent transcription, the researchers identified key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain and found widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator protein showed reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, the fate specified by peak BMP signaling. The findings were incorporated into a model for Mad-dependent activation and discussed in relation to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.Keywords: BMP signaling, Drosophila embryo, Dpp-Scw signaling, Mad transcription factor, Brinker repressor, EGF signaling, Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors, insulator proteins, BEAF-32 protein, dorsal-ventral axis patterning, developmental biology, gene regulation, transcriptional network.
Mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, contain a complex network of proteins that play various roles in energy production, metabolism, and other cellular processes. The mitochondrial protein repertoire can change depending on the cellular state, and mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to a range of human diseases. In this study, researchers used network analysis of gene expression data to investigate the systemic alterations of mitochondria in mtDNA-depleted (ρ0) cells. They discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks, with down-regulated proteins involved in typical mitochondrial functions and up-regulated proteins responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that ρ0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. The results demonstrate that mt protein composition changes to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. Understanding the modular structure of human mt protein functional networks can provide insights into how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.
Thioredoxin (Trx) is a protein that plays a crucial role in redox reactions, particularly in the reduction of arsenate to arsenite by arsenate reductases (ArsC). The mechanism by which Trx and ArsC form and dissociate from each other, forming a mixed disulfide complex, has been a topic of debate for over 20 years. In this study, researchers used molecular dynamics simulations, theoretical reactivity analysis, and biochemical experiments to gain new insights into the mechanism of Trx-ArsC complex dissociation.The researchers found that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx, which is then activated for its nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds. Cys32Trx is more reactive than Cys82ArsC and directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx, rather than Cys89ArsC. This multidisciplinary approach provides new insights into the universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism, which is important for understanding the function of these proteins and the role of thiol-disulfide exchange in biology.The researchers used molecular dynamics simulations, pKa calculations, reactivity analysis with conceptual density functional theory (DFT), and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants to investigate different aspects of the reaction mechanisms. They found that hydrogen bonding to cysteine sulfur atoms is crucial for stabilizing the thiolate form and influencing reactivity. The results of this study provide a new and consistent view of the mechanisms, which is important for understanding the function of these proteins and the role of thiol-disulfide exchange in biology.Keywords: thioredoxin, arsenate reductase, thiol-disulfide exchange, molecular dynamics simulations, reactivity analysis, biochemical experiments.
Complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a crucial role in the immune response against mycobacteria, the bacteria that cause leprosy, by mediating their entry into macrophages. In this study, we investigated the relationship between CR1 genetic variations and susceptibility to leprosy in a Brazilian population. We analyzed nine CR1 polymorphisms in 213 leprosy patients and 297 controls using multiplex PCR-SSP. We also measured CR1 mRNA levels and soluble CR1 (sCR1) in up to 80 samples. Our findings revealed that individuals carrying the most common CR1 haplotype, which includes the rs3849266T in intron 21 and rs3737002T in exon 26, had a higher risk of developing leprosy (OR = 2.43, p = 0.017). Paucibacillary patients with these variants had lower sCR1 levels, which could reduce the anti-inflammatory response. The most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to multibacillary leprosy (OR = 3.04, p = 0.01) and carried the intronic rs12034383G allele, which was associated with higher gene expression. Additionally, we found an inverse correlation between sCR1 and mannose-binding lectin levels (R = -0.52, p = 0.007). These results suggest that CR1 polymorphisms may impact both CR1 mRNA and sCR1 levels, potentially increasing susceptibility to leprosy by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation.
Metagenomic sequencing is a promising method for diagnosing human infections by capturing all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a sample. However, the accuracy of diagnosis depends on the availability and quality of reference genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, but contamination in published genomes can lead to false positives. To address this issue, we have developed a bioinformatics system to eliminate contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes, resulting in a "clean" database for use in bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. This database provides better sensitivity and a significant reduction in false positives compared to using the original genomes.Introduction:Metagenomic sequencing is a valuable tool for human pathogen discovery and diagnosis, offering a fast, specific, and relatively unbiased method of capturing the full spectrum of macro- and microorganisms in any sample. However, the dependence on reference databases for diagnosis presents challenges. No database contains the full spectrum of all potential human pathogens, and existing reference databases have been found to contain contamination. Eukaryotic pathogens, a diverse group of microorganisms that infect multiple areas in the body, are an underrepresented group in genomic databases. They include important human pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, and various fungal and amoeba species. However, no eukaryotic pathogen has been completely sequenced, and draft genomes in databases may contain contamination and incompleteness. Contamination and incompleteness in reference databases can lead to false positive and false negative results, decreasing the overall reliability of NGS in pathogen diagnostics. False positives, where the wrong pathogen is identified, might in turn lead to inaccurate treatments, potentially harming rather than helping patients. In this study, we present a new method for eliminating genomic contamination that can be used on both complete and draft reference genomes. We test our method on a large set of eukaryotic pathogen genomes, yielding a cleaned and filtered eukaryotic pathogen database ready for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those intended for NGS diagnostics, with decreased false positive and false negative rates.Keywords: metagenomic sequencing, human infections, reference genomes, contamination, bioinformatics, eukaryotic pathogens, EuPathDB, false positives, false negatives, NGS diagnostics.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes that contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) by analyzing whole-genome expression profiles from multiple organs. Using a two-way clustering approach, the study identified tissue clusters based on mRNA signals within each organ, and then clustered patients according to the mRNA signals within each tissue cluster to identify signals related to clinical phenotypes. The study found that one tissue cluster, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module), was significantly associated with CAD and was enriched with genes involved in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) pathway. The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module. The findings suggest that the A-module is important for atherosclerosis development and merits further attention in CAD research. The study highlights the importance of a multi-organ approach in understanding complex diseases like CAD, which are believed to develop over a long period and influenced by genetic and environmental risk factors. The results provide insights into the molecular activities that influence the progression and extent of coronary atherosclerosis, potentially paving the way for molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies.Keywords: coronary artery disease, computational biology, molecular genetics, gene expression, cardiovascular disorders.
In this study, researchers investigated the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on human visual perception using multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches. The results revealed that each perceptual report is influenced by two contrasting forces: low-level adaptation, which repels perception away from previous stimuli, and decisional traces, which attract perceptual reports towards the recent past. This hierarchy of serial dependence leads to the formation of "continuity fields," which arise from the inertia of decisional templates and not from low-level sensory processes. This finding supports the Two-process model of serial dependence, which suggests that the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. The researchers propose a unified account of serial dependence, suggesting that functionally distinct mechanisms operate at different stages to promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.
In the natural world, organisms have evolved similar traits despite having different ancestors, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. One such example is the elongated fins used for swimming, which have evolved independently in both vertebrates and invertebrates across three different phyla. This study reveals that the optimal length-to-amplitude ratio of these fins, called the optimal specific wavelength (OSW), is consistently around twenty. This value maximizes the force generated by the body, leading to increased swimming speed. The authors hypothesize that this mechanical optimization is the reason for the repeated emergence of this swimming pattern in evolution.
Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses that cause major human cancers, including cervical, head and neck cancers. Understanding the infectious life cycle of HPVs is crucial for developing new prevention methods, such as vaccines and microbicides. HPVs can only produce progeny virus in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment of stratified epithelium, but why this is the case has not been clear. In this study, researchers used chemical biology approaches to reveal that cell cycle progression through mitosis is a critical factor for HPV infection. They found that HPV infection only occurs when the recipient cell enters M phase (mitosis), and that early M phase inhibitors effectively prevent infection. These findings provide insight into why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia, as only this compartment contains cells progressing through the cell cycle. This discovery has important implications for HPV control and prevention strategies.HPVs are double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the cutaneous and/or mucosal epithelium in many vertebrates. Over 100 HPV genotypes are categorized as high risk or low risk based on their oncogenicity. High risk HPVs are causally associated with anogenital cancers, including cervical cancer, which is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. HPV is also associated with 25% of head and neck cancers and 6th most common cancer in the US.The HPV life cycle is tightly linked to the differentiation of its host epithelial cells. HPV infection and DNA establishment only occur in dividing basal cells of stratified epithelium. HPV early genes are expressed throughout the life cycle, while late capsid genes L1 and L2 are only expressed in terminally differentiated epithelial cells. The mechanisms controlling the HPV life cycle, particularly the restriction of HPV infection and DNA establishment to dividing basal cells, are not well understood.Recently developed transfection methods have overcome the limitation of producing large yields of infectious HPV particles, providing a genetically modifiable, high yield source for studies of the mechanisms of natural HPV infection. Researchers tested approximately 5,000 bioactive compounds with known mechanisms of action for effects on HPV capsids containing reporter genes or the full HPV genome and identified a subset of cell cycle inhibitors that completely blocked wild type HPV infection. Further studies showed that cell cycle progression through early stages of mitosis is critical for successful HPV infection. These findings reveal new insights into the mechanism by which HPV infects cells and provide one reason why HPV infects only undifferentiated, proliferating cells. These results also provide new leads for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies against HPV infection.Keywords: HPV, human papillomavirus, virology, cell cycle, mitosis, infection, prevention, cancer, stratified epithelium.
Orofacial clefts, including cleft lip and palate, are common birth defects with both genetic and environmental causes. While numerous studies have been conducted to understand the complex genetic etiology of this condition, the underlying factors remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene as a cause of syndromic orofacial clefting. HYAL2 encodes hyaluronidase 2, which degrades extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. Our findings reveal that these gene mutations destabilize the molecule, resulting in reduced HYAL2 protein levels and leading to craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, cor triatriatum sinister, and hearing loss. These findings identify a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting in humans and mice and define the first molecular cause of human cor triatriatum sinister, highlighting the importance of HYAL2 and hyaluronan turnover for normal human and mouse development.Introduction:Orofacial clefts, which include cleft lip with or without cleft palate and cleft palate alone, are among the most common birth defects worldwide. The majority of cases are of unknown molecular cause, and the frequency varies across racial and ethnic groups, socioeconomic status, and gender. Orofacial clefts arise from a failure of the intricate molecular and cellular processes that regulate bilateral fusion of the future lip and palate during craniofacial development. They are clinically categorized as non-syndromic or syndromic, depending on the presence or absence of additional congenital anomalies. For non-syndromic orofacial clefts, 17 genetic risk loci have been identified, but recent evidence suggests that non-coding or regulatory genomic regions may also play a role. For syndromic forms of orofacial clefts, over 300 different syndromes have been described, and congenital heart disease (CHD) is commonly associated with syndromic orofacial clefts. Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly reported in 0.1-0.4% of individuals with congenital heart disease. It is characterized by division of either the left (cor triatriatum sinister) or right atrium and is associated with cleft palate. To date, no molecular cause has been identified for cor triatriatum in humans. In this study, we identify mutations in the HYAL2 gene as a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting in humans and mice and describe the first molecular basis for cor triatriatum sinister in humans. Our findings illustrate the fundamental importance of hyaluronan (HA) turnover for normal human and mouse development.Keywords: orofacial clefts, HYAL2, hyaluronidase 2, hyaluronan, craniofacial development, cleft palate, cor triatriatum sinister, mouse model, human development.
Hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, during brain development can lead to chronic neurodevelopmental impairments, but the mechanisms behind this are not well understood. Recent research in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that hypoxia can cause axon pathfinding errors in certain neurons. However, it is unclear if similar effects occur in vertebrates. In this study, researchers investigated the effects of developmental hypoxia on zebrafish (Danio rerio) and found that it leads to errors in the crossing of commissural axons in the forebrain. These errors are caused by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway and can be prevented by blocking transcriptional activation by hif1α. The researchers identified ephrinB2a as a target of hif1 pathway activation and found that knocking down ephrinB2a rescued the guidance errors. They also found that the receptor ephA4a is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons and that ephrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Magnesium sulfate, which is used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing the upregulation of ephrinB2a. These findings suggest that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia and support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium.
Filarial nematodes, which cause diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, have a mutualistic relationship with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia. This relationship is essential for the nematodes' development, fertility, and viability. However, the mechanisms behind this relationship are not well understood. In this study, researchers used whole mount confocal microscopy to investigate the effects of Wolbachia depletion on nematode development. They found that Wolbachia depletion led to extensive apoptosis in the adult germline and embryos, even in cells that had not been infected prior to treatment. This apoptosis was non-cell autonomous, suggesting that factors originating from Wolbachia in the hypodermal chords were involved. The pattern of apoptosis correlated with the nematode tissues and processes initially perturbed following Wolbachia depletion, such as embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. These findings provide a cellular mechanism to explain the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes. This research sheds light on the importance of Wolbachia in the survival and development of filarial nematodes and could lead to new approaches for treating filarial diseases.Keywords: filarial nematodes, Wolbachia, apoptosis, development, fertility, viability, antibiotic therapy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, microbiology, parasitology, parasite physiology, infectious disease control, neglected tropical diseases, elephantiasis.
Swine are proposed to act as a "mixing vessel" for generating reassortants of avian and mammalian influenza A viruses (IAVs) that could pose a risk to mammals, including humans. However, the process of how a transmissible reassortant emerges in swine is not well understood. In a study, researchers analyzed 571 isolates of IAVs recovered from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues of co-housed pigs infected with avian H1N1 IAV and swine H3N2 IAV. They identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants, with the largest genomic diversity found in viruses recovered from lower respiratory tract tissues. Reassortants from lower respiratory tracts had the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells. The study findings suggest that during mixed infections of avian and swine IAVs, genetic reassortments are likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract, and tissue tropism is an important factor selecting for a transmissible reassortant. The researchers confirmed that one reassortant in nasal wash samples was transmitted efficiently between pigs. The study provides valuable insights into the host's immune reaction against neuroinvasive Toxocara spp.-larvae, contributing to the characterization of the mostly unknown pathogenesis of NT.
Scientists have discovered that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 plays a role in the DNA damage checkpoint, specifically in the process of adaptation. Adaptation occurs when cells are exposed to persistent or irreparable DNA damage and are able to escape the cell-cycle arrest imposed by the checkpoint. The mechanism of adaptation is not well understood, but it is known that Cdc5 is dose-dependent for adaptation and that its overexpression promotes faster adaptation. By overexpressing CDC5 from the GAL1 promoter in damaged cells and examining key steps in checkpoint activation, researchers found that Cdc5 had little effect on the early steps leading to Rad53 activation. However, they did find that Rad53 hyperphosphorylation was significantly reduced, indicating that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation. This allows cells to adapt to DNA damage and continue with the cell cycle. Polo-like kinases have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to facilitate the activation of downstream checkpoint kinases, suggesting that this function is conserved in vertebrates. The findings suggest that Cdc5 acts to inhibit the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage.
This study combines neurophysiological modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to understand the persistent alternations in auditory perception during minutes-long presentations of repeating ABA-triplet tone sequences. Unlike previous models, this network model incorporates neuronal units with sensory feature-dependent inputs that mimic the pulsatile-like A1 responses to tones in the ABA-triplets. The model embodies a neuronal computation for percept competition thought to occur beyond primary auditory cortex (A1). Mutual inhibition, adaptation, noise, and slow NMDA recurrent excitation for local temporal memory are implemented. The model predicts that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept, a property that has been previously established in various visual bistable paradigms. The study confirms this prediction through psychoacoustic experiments and uses the behavioral data to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. The work provides a platform for future extensions to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition.
Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are two mosquito species that spread diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, and Zika virus. To assess the competitiveness of sterilized males in the wild, researchers have been exploring male-based sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT). A rapid and economical diagnostic tool for determining the success of sterilized males in the field is needed. Previous studies have shown that rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, can be used to stain the body tissue and seminal fluid of insects. In this study, researchers adapted the technique for male Ae. aegypti to assess mating success during field releases. They found that feeding males on 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, or 0.8% rhodamine B in 50% honey solutions resulted in over 95% transfer to females and successful body marking after 4 days. Rhodamine B marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness and was effective in field releases, demonstrating successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females and recapture of marked males. Rhodamine B is a potentially useful evaluation method for male-based SIT/IIT control strategies and a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments without the negative side-effects of traditional marking methods. As a standalone method for mating competitiveness assays, rhodamine B marking is less expensive and less time-consuming than paternity analysis and female fertility assays.
A tick's midgut is an essential organ for its survival as it allows the tick to digest blood from its host. Ticks produce various protease inhibitors to avoid the host's hemostatic system and maintain a low inflammatory tone in the midgut. One such inhibitor is Boophilin, which has been identified as a multifunctional inhibitor targeting thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. However, the mechanism of Boophilin's interaction with these enzymes and its effect on platelet function and thrombosis in vivo are not well understood. In this study, we purified Boophilin from HEK293 cells and investigated its inhibitory activity using amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments. Our results showed that Boophilin behaves as a non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin and FXIa, preventing FIX activation. It also inhibits kallikrein activity and reciprocal activation, indicating that it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore, Boophilin abrogates cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Finally, Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion in vivo and promotes bleeding, demonstrating its role in maintaining a low hemostatic and inflammatory tone in the midgut. Overall, Boophilin plays a crucial role in the tick's ability to digest a blood meal and supports metabolism and egg development by inhibiting several enzymes involved in proteolytic cascades and cell activation.
In mammals, the X chromosome in females is inactivated to balance the expression of genes between the sexes. However, the mechanisms controlling X chromosome expression in triploid cells, which have an extra set of chromosomes, are not well understood. In this study, researchers used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells. They found that the X:autosome expression ratio was lower in triploid cells with one active X chromosome and higher in cells with two active X chromosomes. This suggests that X-linked gene expression in triploid cells does not strictly respond to an autosomal factor and is not adjusted to achieve a perfect balance. The unbalanced X:autosome expression ratios observed could contribute to the abnormal phenotypes associated with triploidy. The researchers also found that absolute autosomal expression levels per gene copy were similar in triploid and diploid cells, indicating no apparent global effect on autosomal expression. In triploid cells with two active X chromosomes, X-linked gene expression was doubled. However, in cells with a single active X chromosome, X-linked gene expression was adjusted upward presumably by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets. This mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose expression dosage in relation to autosomal expression is critical. The researchers found that a small subset of X-linked genes had expression levels apparently proportional to the number of autosomal sets. Overall, these findings provide insights into the complex regulation of X chromosome expression in triploid cells.Keywords: genetics and genomics, epigenetics, gene expression, X chromosome, triploid cells.
Candida albicans, a common fungus found in the human body, can switch from a harmless commensal to a pathogenic form, leading to various infections. The switch from commensalism to pathogenicity involves morphological and transcriptional changes. Previous studies have identified several factors involved in this transformation, but it is unclear how they are regulated to coordinate the switch. In this study, researchers focused on post-translational phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism. They identified the Fkh2 transcription factor as a target of both Cdc28 and Cbk1, two kinases involved in this process. Fkh2 undergoes a unique phosphorylation profile during the switch from yeast to hyphal form, which is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. The phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity by allowing it to interact with the chromatin modifier Pob3. This discovery of a cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event provides new insights into the regulation of the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity in Candida albicans.
Herpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV), exit infected cells through a complex process involving the host secretory pathway and viral components. To better understand this process, researchers developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to selectively image fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane and a pH-sensitive probe to visualize exocytosis. They found that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles, and key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway, such as Rab GTPases Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a, are present on the virus secretory vesicle. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport to the site of exocytosis, which is most frequently near patches of LL5β, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. Vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exocytosis for several seconds, and membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. By combining these findings with recent reports in the cell biological and alpha herpesvirus literature, the researchers propose an integrated model of the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress.Keywords: herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, PRV, secretory pathway, exocytosis, live-cell fluorescence microscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, pH-sensitive probe, Rab GTPases, Rab6a, Rab8a, Rab11a, LL5β, microtubules, viral egress, exocytosis, intracellular transport, alpha herpesviruses, viral particles, plasma membrane, cell biology, molecular biology.
Influenza viruses, particularly the H1N1 and H3N2 strains of type A and type B, continue to pose a significant threat to public health, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Accurately assessing the impact of new influenza strains on human deaths is crucial for effective planning and response, but current methods rely on intensive and unbiased surveillance which can be limited and prone to bias. In this study, we propose a novel host-virus interaction model to establish a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by viral strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each subtype of seasonal influenza viruses. This relationship can be used to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between H1N1 strains. Rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden for new seasonal strains will help formulate cost-effective response strategies for influenza control and prevention.Introduction:Seasonal influenza viruses, including A, B, and C, continue to pose a significant threat to public health. Among them, influenza H1N1 and H3N2 of type A and type B are currently circulating frequently in the human population. During evolution, many variants of influenza virus with distinct antigenic properties have emerged either by mutation or reassortment of the gene encoding the viral coat protein hemagglutinin (HA). These antigenic variants have caused morbidity and mortality with varying magnitudes. Accurately predicting the influenza mortality burden at the early stage of influenza infection is challenging due to limited and biased morbidity and mortality data for early influenza surveillance. This speaks to an urgent need for the development of a more effective method for rapid and accurate estimation of the mortality burden of influenza virus. It is generally assumed that the extent of an influenza virus to alter its antigenicity and to escape the pre-existing immunity in the human population determines its intensity of infection at the population level and thus the mortality burden. Despite the obvious causal relationship between the antigenic variations of influenza viruses and their mortality burdens, to our knowledge, no report has ever established a direct and positive correlation between them. In this study, we describe our work on how to establish a positive correlation between the antigenic variation of human influenza virus and the total excess mortality it causes during all periods of its circulation. The established relationship has further enabled us to develop a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between H1N1 strains based on their HA sequences.Keywords: Public health and epidemiology, Infectious diseases, Epidemiology and control of infectious diseases, Computational biology.
Leishmania parasites, which cause various forms of disease in humans and animals, exist in two forms: extracellular promastigotes in insect vectors and intracellular amastigotes in mammalian host cells. The intracellular amastigotes reside in parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs), which are customized organelles that vary in size and function between different Leishmania species. In this study, researchers investigated whether PVs of different Leishmania species could fuse with each other by infecting mouse macrophages with non-fluorescent L. amazonensis amastigotes and later with fluorescent L. major amastigotes or promastigotes. They found that L. amazonensis and L. major amastigotes did not fuse, but L. major promastigotes could enter and multiply in pre-existing L. amazonensis PVs. However, L. major promastigotes did not differentiate into amastigotes in these chimeric vacuoles. In contrast, L. major promastigotes differentiated into amastigotes in their own, unfused PVs. These findings suggest that PVs have species-specific properties that affect their ability to fuse with other Leishmania PVs and that a species-specific PV is required for L. major destruction or differentiation. These observations provide valuable insights into the interactions between PVs of different Leishmania species and the mechanisms involved in the recognition and fusion of PVs.Introduction:Leishmania parasites are dimorphic trypanosomatids that cause cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral diseases in humans and other animals. They have elongated, proliferating extracellular promastigote forms in the midgut of sandflies and stationary phase metacyclic promastigotes that can infect mammalian hosts. Macrophages and other mammalian cells internalize infective promastigotes within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs), where they differentiate into smaller, internally flagellated, oval-shaped amastigote forms that divide intracellularly and spread the infection. Leishmania PVs are bound by a membrane derived from the host cell plasma membrane and undergo compositional changes as they fuse with late endosomes/lysosomes and possibly other vesicles. They are considered acidic organelles that contain lysosomal enzymes and present a vacuolar pH in the range of 4.7-5.2. Most studies on Leishmania PVs have been performed with parasites of the mexicana group, L. amazonensis and L. mexicana, which are sheltered in large, communal PVs that may contain many amastigotes. These large PVs selectively fuse with phagosomes containing large particles or microorganisms. However, most Leishmania species are lodged in small, membrane-bound PVs which display lysosomal markers, usually contain a single parasite, and undergo fission as parasites divide. The pH within L. donovani membrane-bound PV is about 5.5, and the increase in vacuolar pH to 5.8 is tolerated by the parasites and exacerbates intracellular infection. In the present studies, macrophages infected with L. amazonensis were challenged with L. major lesion amastigotes or promastigotes and coinfected cells were observed by multidimensional live imaging. The aim was to investigate whether PVs of different Leishmania species could fuse with each other and if a species-specific PV was required for L. major destruction or differentiation.
Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by flatworms, is a major public health concern, particularly in developing countries. Schistosomes, the causative agents of the disease, rely on insulin signaling for growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production. In this study, we investigated the role of insulin receptors (SjIRs) in Schistosoma japonicum using Biolayer Interferometry to confirm that human insulin can bind to the L1 subdomains (SjLD1 and SjLD2) of recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2. We then used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of SjIRs in adult S. japonicum and found that not only was their transcription reduced, but the expression of other important downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity was also impacted. Additionally, we observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake in SjIR-knockdown worms compared to luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, we found that rSjLD1 and rSjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These findings re-emphasize the potential of SjIRs as veterinary transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines.
A protein called Nef, which is produced by primate lentiviruses, is essential for the virus to replicate and progress to AIDS. Nef has been shown to increase the infectivity of cell-free virions, but the mechanism by which it does this has not been fully understood. In this study, researchers investigated the relationship between Nef and another viral protein called Env. They found that Nef increases resistance to two potent neutralizing antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, which target a specific region of Env called the membrane proximal external region (MPER). This resistance was observed in a range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as in virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, and primary isolates. The resistance to neutralization by 2F5 and 4E10 was found to be due to Nef's ability to alter MPER recognition in the context of the virion membrane. Nef and a glycosylated version of the Gag protein from a gammaretrovirus both conferred resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. These findings have important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.Introduction:Nef is a multifunctional protein produced by primate lentiviruses. It is required for sustained virus replication in vivo and accelerated progression to AIDS. Nef has been shown to downregulate cell-surface molecules CD4 and MHC-I, modulate T-cell and macrophage activation, and counteract the restriction factor BST-2. However, the least understood of Nef's functions is its requirement for the production of virion particles with maximal infectivity. Nef has been found in virions, but it is not clear whether Nef encapsidation is required to promote virion infectivity. In this study, researchers explored the possibility that Nef confers a qualitative, rather than a quantitative, effect on Env encapsidation by taking advantage of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and other reagents that target distinct features of the Env glycoprotein.
The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a crucial enzyme responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA) in eukaryotic cells. The process of transcription involves the separation of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at the active site, allowing the template strand to act as a guide for mRNA synthesis. Nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are required for the formation of the mRNA chain, but the exact route they take to reach the active site remains unclear. Two potential entry routes have been proposed: the secondary channel and the main channel. While crystallographic structures of Pol II have provided valuable insights into the structural basis of transcription, the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the full transcription bubble (TB) is still unknown. Understanding the structure of the full TB is essential for a complete understanding of Pol II transcription. In this study, researchers built a structural model of Pol II with a complete TB using multiple sources of existing structural data and performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to shed light on NTP entry pathways. The results showed that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription, as it has a higher percentage of MD conformations with enough space for NTP loading. The main channel, on the other hand, is disfavored due to strong electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of Pol II transcription and highlights the importance of understanding the structural basis of this essential biological process.Keywords: RNA polymerase II, transcription, nucleotide triphosphates, secondary channel, main channel, molecular dynamics, structural model.
In this study, researchers investigated how contextual bars influence the perception of a target bar in visual object recognition. Participants were asked to determine if a target bar was present at the center of a display, with weak or missing contrast at the target location, with or without the presence of contextual bars. The results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when the context had a weaker contrast and could perceptually group well with the target. However, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of their grouping with the target, biased observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounted for the data, suggesting that context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief about the presence of a target based on visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The findings suggest that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences.
Lectin-like bacteriotoxic proteins, found in certain plant-associated bacteria, have the ability to selectively kill closely related species, including phytopathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas. The crystal structure of LlpABW, a prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, reveals an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain adopts a fold similar to MMBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides. Mutational analysis indicates that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal MMBL domain adopts the same fold but is structurally more divergent and lacks a functional mannose-binding site. The N-domain determines target specificity, suggesting that this bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity.
Bacteria exhibit a wide range of genomic GC-content, from less than 20% to over 70%. This variation is often attributed to differences in mutation patterns between species. However, the hypothesis that mutation bias explains this variation has been challenged. In a study of 149 bacterial species, an excess of synonymous GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations was found, which cannot be explained by mutation bias alone. This excess is not due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich, and the excess of GC→AT SNPs was observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. Therefore, it is concluded that there is selection for an increase in synonymous GC-content in many species, and thus, genomic base composition in bacteria.
The expansion of CAG/CTG repeats is linked to several genetic diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy 1. The instability of these repeats is tissue-specific and contributes to disease progression. The mechanisms underlying repeat instability are complex, and it is unclear whether chromatin structure and/or transcription contribute to somatic CAG/CTG instability in vivo. In this study, researchers investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus using R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene but have different integration sites, and both lines recapitulate HD tissue-specific instability. The researchers found that instability rates are increased in R6/2 tissues compared to R6/1 matched-samples. High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with increased CAG instability in R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation at the HD locus were increased, whereas H3K9 dimethylation was reduced in R6/2 tissues. However, transgene expression and these specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues with very different CAG instability levels. Interestingly, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Similarly, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum. These results suggest that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability.
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that disproportionately affect low-income populations, and research efforts to address them have increased in recent decades. To evaluate Germany's contributions to NTD research and identify potential collaborations, we analyzed bibliometric data from SCOPUS database for publications with German authors between 2002 and 2012. We identified 1,187 publications with at least one German author affiliation, and extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. Our analysis revealed that the majority of collaborations were with high-income countries and Brazil, with limited collaborations on the African continent. We also found that NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions, with strong performers identified using classic parameters and social network analysis. The research network characteristics varied between diseases, and the share of NTD publications with German affiliations was half of its share in other fields. Our findings highlight the need to identify barriers and expand German research activities towards NTDs, and geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity in low- and middle-income countries. Using free tools to analyze research processes and output can facilitate data-driven health policies and prioritize resources effectively. Our findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.Keywords: Neglected Tropical Diseases, NTDs, bibliometric analysis, co-authorship networks, Germany, research collaboration, social network analysis, NTD research, global health, public health policies.
Chagas disease, a vector-borne disease endemic to Latin America, is primarily transmitted by domiciled triatomine vectors, which have been effectively controlled through residual insecticide spraying and housing improvement. However, non-domiciled vectors, which do not establish permanent colonies in homes but occasionally infest them, pose a significant risk for disease transmission. A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciled vectors inside houses, using data from the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. The model accurately predicted the seasonal pattern of infestation and tested the efficacy of control strategies, including residual insecticide spraying, insect screens, and bednets. The results showed that pyrethroid spraying was effective when applied yearly in a two-month period during the immigration season, but larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction in bug abundance. Insect screens, on the other hand, consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. The model also revealed that insecticide spraying is not an effective long-term solution for controlling non-domiciled vectors due to the need for yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens offer a sustainable alternative for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
People's preferences, or "tastes," are not fixed and can change based on new information and experiences. In this study, researchers hypothesized that people's tastes are uncertain beliefs and that they update these beliefs based on evidence, such as the preferences of others. The researchers examined discounting preferences, which measure a person's patience, in a large community study of 14-24 year olds. They found that participants displayed decision variability, which was better explained by a random-taste model than a response-noise model. They also found that apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model that took into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. These findings have implications for neuroscience, clinical research, and developmental psychology. The researchers suggest that people's uncertainty about their own preferences leads them to consider the preferences of others as data and update their beliefs accordingly. This study provides insight into the computational structure of epistemic preference change and has implications for understanding the development and repair of maladaptive discounting, which is of clinical relevance. The researchers used a Bayesian framework to explain how social influences might lead people to develop or repair maladaptive discounting. They found that subjects' uncertainty about their preferences was reflected in the variability of their choices, and that they shifted their preferences more when learning about others' preferences, especially if the reference group was relevant to both the index person and the social influencer. These effects were dominant over more complex social motives, such as opposition or competition. Overall, this study provides new insights into the nature of preference change and the role of social influences in shaping our beliefs and behaviors.
Rice is a monocotyledonous crop that differs from the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis in many aspects, including the interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulating root growth. In Arabidopsis, ethylene and auxin act synergistically to regulate root development. However, their interaction in rice is not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated the role of OsEIL1 in the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis in ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice. They found that OsEIL1 directly activates the expression of YUC8/REIN7, which catalyzes the conversion of IPA to IAA, the major form of auxin in plants. Ethylene-induced YUC8/REIN7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots. The findings suggest that ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the ethylene signaling pathway in rice and enhances our understanding of the complex interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulating root growth.Keywords: rice, ethylene, auxin, root growth, YUC8/REIN7, IPA, IAA, auxin biosynthesis, ethylene signaling, monocotyledonous crops, dicotyledonous plants.
Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 plays a role in regulating cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle-regulated transcription factors. Its expression is dynamic during the cell cycle and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes, as well as reduced expression of B-MYB and altered alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. MALAT1 interacts with splicing factors to regulate their binding to target pre-mRNAs, and its depletion results in cell cycle defects that are sensitive to p53 levels. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation.Introduction:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that have emerged as important molecules in several cellular processes. While the function of most lncRNAs is still unknown, they have been shown to act as a scaffold, guide, and influence chromatin architecture, regulate transcription and RNA processing events, and serve as precursors for small RNAs. In this study, we focus on the lncRNA MALAT1, which is upregulated in cancer tissues and has been linked to hyper-proliferation. However, the underlying mechanism of how MALAT1 upregulation contributes to cancer is poorly understood.Results:Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in normal human diploid fibroblasts revealed that MALAT1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 led to activation of p53 and its target genes, as well as reduced expression of B-MYB (Mybl2), an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression. This reduction in B-MYB expression was due to altered binding of splicing factors on its pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. In human cells, MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by regulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle–regulated transcription factors.Conclusion:These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation. MALAT1 interacts with splicing factors to regulate their binding to target pre-mRNAs and influences alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs, allowing cells to alter the local concentration of a particular splicing factor upon a specific external signal or during specific stages of the cell cycle. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation and provides a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.Keywords: lncRNA, MALAT1, cell cycle, p53, B-MYB, pre-mRNA processing, alternative splicing.
HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, is primarily transmitted to women through vaginal intercourse. Semen, the fluid released during ejaculation, plays a crucial role in HIV transmission, as it contains various biological factors that can affect the virus. One such factor is interleukin-7 (IL-7), a cytokine that is present in high concentrations in semen. In this study, researchers investigated the role of IL-7 in HIV-1 vaginal transmission using an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue. They found that IL-7 significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in the cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue. This was due to IL-7's ability to prevent CD4+ T cell apoptosis and promote their proliferation, as evidenced by a decrease in apoptotic marker expression and an increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. High levels of seminal IL-7 may help the initial pool of HIV-1-infected cells survive and expand in the cervico-vaginal mucosa during the early stages of infection, promoting the dissemination of HIV.
In the field of evolutionary biology, the origins of genetic robustness - a system's ability to maintain its function despite genetic or environmental perturbations - are still a topic of debate. Some researchers propose that robustness arises as a result of environmental requirements, while others suggest it is an intrinsic factor or an adaptive trait. To better understand the origins of robustness, a large-scale computational study was conducted to examine the robustness of metabolic networks in hundreds of bacterial species across various simulated growth environments. The study found that variations in robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations, and can be decoupled into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent. The environmental-dependent component is responsible for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle, while the environmental-independent component is linked to a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities. The findings suggest that fast growers and organisms with extensive secondary metabolite production exhibit higher robustness. Additionally, the study identified reactions that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets. Overall, this study provides insights into the origins of genetic robustness and its relationship to metabolic networks.Keywords: evolutionary biology, microbial evolution and genomics, computational biology, metabolic networks, microbiology, microbial evolution and genomics.
Histones are essential proteins that help structure DNA in the nucleus of a cell. During DNA replication and repair, new histones are deposited onto the DNA to form nucleosomes. This process is facilitated by histone chaperones CAF-1 and Asf1, which work together with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to promote nucleosome formation. The Elongator complex, a six-subunit histone acetyltransferase, plays a crucial role in this process by acetylating histones H3 and H4. The absence of the Elongator complex leads to a loss of silencing of certain genes and increased sensitivity to DNA damage agents. The Elongator complex interacts with PCNA both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a role in the DNA replication and repair-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway. The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of histone modifications and nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair.Histones are the proteins that help structure DNA in the nucleus of a cell.

This process is facilitated by histone chaperones CAF-1 and Asf1, which work together with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to promote nucleosome formation. The Elongator complex, a six-subunit histone acetyltransferase, plays a crucial role in this process by acetylating histones H3 and H4.The absence of the Elongator complex leads to a loss of silencing of certain genes and increased sensitivity to DNA damage agents, such as hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate. This is evidenced by the fact that cells lacking Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, exhibit severe growth defects and are sensitive to these agents. Furthermore, mutations in each of the other subunits of the Elongator complex or mutations that compromise the formation of the Elongator complex also result in a loss of silencing and increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea.Epistasis analysis indicates that the elp3Δ mutant, which itself is sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate, exacerbates the MMS sensitivity of cells lacking histone chaperones Asf1, CAF-1, and the H3 lysine 56 acetyltransferase Rtt109. The elp3Δ mutant also has allele-specific genetic interactions with mutations in POL30, which encodes PCNA. These results suggest that the intact Elongator complex is required for transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability, and it does so in a pathway linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA.The Elongator complex interacts with PCNA both in vivo and in vitro, providing further evidence for its role in the DNA replication and repair-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of histone modifications and nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair.Keywords: histones, DNA replication, DNA repair, nucleosome assembly, Elongator complex, CAF-1, Asf1, PCNA, transcriptional silencing, genome stability.
Vaccines are an essential tool in preventing infectious diseases, and determining the optimal inoculum dose is crucial for effective vaccine design. A higher inoculum dose generally leads to better immune response but may cause more severe side effects and reduce population coverage in the event of vaccine shortages. In this study, we demonstrate how mathematical models and experimental data can be combined to determine the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity. We applied this approach to influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection in cotton rats, and our findings illustrate that the relationship between inoculum dose and protection or morbidity is not always monotonic. Our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal inoculum dose, contributing to better vaccine design and improved public health outcomes.Vaccines come in various forms, including those containing non-replicating antigens and live attenuated pathogens. The inoculum dose is a critical factor in vaccine design, as higher doses generally lead to stronger immune responses but may cause more side effects and reduce population coverage. Determining the optimal inoculum dose is essential for effective vaccine design, especially in the context of vaccine shortages or pandemics.Currently, the determination of vaccine inoculum dose is primarily based on trial and error, which is expensive and logistically challenging. To address this, we propose a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data to optimize vaccine dosing regimens, as is commonly done in drug development.We developed and analyzed a quantitative modeling framework using data from IAV and HPIV infection experiments. Our findings demonstrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose.Our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum for a given vaccine and setting. This approach can contribute significantly to the development of better vaccines that remain protective in the presence of antigenic drift and have a higher efficacy.Keywords: vaccines, immunology, infectious diseases, influenza, parainfluenza, mathematical models, experimental data, inoculum dose, immune protection, morbidity, rational vaccine design.
Changes in DNA methylation patterns are linked to the development of cancer. The enzyme Dnmt3a plays a crucial role in establishing normal methylation patterns and is implicated in leukemias. In a mouse model of lung cancer, deletion of Dnmt3a has been shown to promote tumor progression, suggesting that it may suppress tumor development by maintaining DNA methylation patterns. To better understand the role of Dnmt3a in cancer, researchers used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to compare the methylomes of Dnmt3a wildtype and deficient mouse lung tumors. The results showed that Dnmt3a wildtype tumors had large hypomethylated domains, while Dnmt3a-deficient tumors had a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Dnmt3a was required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains, and Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. Overall, these findings provide insight into the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer.Introduction:Altered DNA methylation patterns are a hallmark of human cancers. Over the past 30 years, numerous studies have contributed to the understanding of the cancer methylome, revealing a global loss of methylation marks and hypermethylation of promoter-associated CpG islands as its main features. DNA methylation is established and maintained by three DNA methyltransferases: Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b. While Dnmt1 is responsible for maintaining methylation, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are involved in the establishment of methylation patterns during embryogenesis. Mutations in Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b have been linked to cancer, but their precise role in generating cancer-specific methylomes is not well understood. In mouse models, heterozygous mutations in Dnmt1 and deletion of Dnmt3b have been shown to reduce tumor size and prevalence, while overexpression of Dnmt3b enhances intestinal tumor formation. However, genetic mutations in DNMT1 or DNMT3B have not been described in human tumors. DNMT3A, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, is traditionally considered to play an important role in the establishment of methylation patterns during early embryogenesis. Recently, genetic mutations in the human DNMT3A gene have been identified in several hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and T-cell lymphoma. These mutations are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting they may contribute to the disease phenotype. However, the methylation differences between DNMT3A wildtype and mutant patients are limited, and their significance for the disease phenotype remains unclear. To gain a more detailed understanding of DNMT3A's role in cancer, researchers have used a mouse model where conditional deletion of Dnmt3a in hematopoietic stem cells caused pronounced differentiation defects. Further analysis suggested that the absence of Dnmt3a caused both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of promoter regions and deregulation of stem cell and differentiation genes. Consistent with its tumor suppressor role, deletion of Dnmt3a promotes tumor progression in a mouse model for lung cancer. Immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA suggested that several thousand fragments were hypomethylated in Dnmt3a-deficient tumors, predominantly localized to intragenic regions. To comprehensively and quantitatively characterize Dnmt3a-dependent methylation changes at single base-pair resolution, researchers used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to establish genome-wide methylation maps from normal lung tissue, Dnmt3a wildtype tumors, and Dnmt3a knockout tumors. Their findings reveal a novel function of this de novo methyltransferase in cancer, as Dnmt3a deficiency results in loss of methylation in large active chromatin domains.Keywords: cancer genetics, chromosome structure and function, genome sequencing, epigenetics, DNA, chromosome biology, comparative genomics, biology, DNA modification, molecular biology, nucleic acids, genetics, genomics, molecular cell biology, genetics and genomics.
A longer PR interval on an electrocardiogram, which reflects the time it takes for electrical signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles, is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias and all-cause mortality. PR interval duration is heritable and has been suggested to differ among different human populations. While genome-wide association studies (GWA) have identified common genetic determinants of PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, there is a lack of such studies in individuals of African ancestry. In this study, we performed GWA studies in 6,247 African Americans from four cohorts and identified a strong association between a genetic variant in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) and PR interval duration. This variant, rs3922844, explained 2% of the PR interval variability in African Americans and was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to PR interval in African Americans and identify an association signal at the SCN5A locus that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and explore the functional implications of these genetic variants.Introduction:The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive test that provides valuable information about the electrical activity of the heart. The PR interval on the ECG reflects the time it takes for electrical signals to travel from the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node and the ventricles. Impaired conduction through the atria and AV node is a central pathogenic mechanism in many cardiac arrhythmias, and prolongation of the PR interval is a risk factor for long-term atrial fibrillation, heart block, and all-cause mortality. A substantial proportion of the variability of the PR interval is explained by genetic factors, with heritability estimates ranging between 30 and 50% in populations of European and Asian ancestry. Identification of the specific alleles underlying the heritability of the PR interval could provide novel insights into molecular electrophysiology, lead to novel drug targets for arrhythmia treatment, and facilitate genetic prediction of arrhythmia risk and response to antiarrhythmics. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified nine loci associated with PR interval duration in populations of European and South Asian ancestry, but there is a paucity of such studies in populations of African ancestry. African ancestry offers greater genetic diversity, which could facilitate the identification of unique alleles influencing complex traits. We studied the association of genetic ancestry with PR interval and performed a GWA study in 6,247 African Americans from four cohorts as part of the Candidate-gene Association Resource (CARe) consortium, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), the Cleveland Family Study (CFS), the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Replication of genome-wide significant associations was attempted in 2,022 African Americans from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC) and the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Study (HANDLS).
Inhibitory neurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in various brain systems. Two common inhibitory network motifs, feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB), have been identified in different neural circuits. In the locust olfactory system, it was proposed that lateral horn interneurons (LHNs) provide feed-forward inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing, which is essential for olfactory learning and memory. However, recent studies suggest that a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), is the primary source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and that inhibition from this cell is mediated by a feedback loop including KCs and the GGN. To better understand the differences between FF and FB inhibition in circuit dynamics, a model of the locust olfactory system was developed. The study found that both inhibitory motifs could maintain sparse KCs responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with in vivo data. These findings suggest that the GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs, and provide insights into the impact of inhibitory motifs on post-synaptic neuronal activity, which could be used to reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.
The BRCA Challenge is a project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate data on BRCA1 and BRCA2, two genes linked to breast and ovarian cancer risk. The goal is to provide a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. The project has amassed over 20,000 variants, three times the number in the next-largest public database, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data is based on shared information from existing clinical databases and population databases, linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge brings together experts from around the world to advance our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes data sharing, development of methods for extracting genetic variation at the individual laboratory report level, and engagement with patient communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The project aims to reduce uncertainty and inconsistency in variant interpretation by aggregating data and providing expert-reviewed, classified, and annotated variants. The BRCA Exchange, the publicly accessible website for the project, displays over 20,000 unique BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, with more than 6,100 of those variants displayed with expert classifications from the ENIGMA Consortium. The data is updated monthly and is freely available for download. The BRCA Challenge is an important step towards creating a comprehensive data-sharing and curation system that could be easily applied to other genes and ultimately, all genes underlying recognized disease phenotypes.
In the field of cellular signaling, the RAS/MAPK pathway is a well-known oncogene and a crucial conduit for transmitting proliferative signals in both normal and cancer cells. The RAF-MEK-MAPK module, which lies downstream of RAS, is a key component of this pathway. Over the past two decades, researchers have identified several factors regulating RAS/MAPK signaling, most of which control RAF activation. However, it remains unclear whether additional factors exist further downstream.To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the elements functionally linked to the RAS/MAPK cascade, researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells. This screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known factors associated with this pathway.Epistasis experiments were then carried out on individual candidates to determine their position relative to core pathway components. While this revealed several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway, most hits unexpectedly worked downstream of MEK and specifically influenced MAPK expression. These hits mainly consisted of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels.Two representative members of this group were further characterized, and it was found that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, such as those controlling RAF activation, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Additionally, it indicates that core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing.
In recent years, advances in technology have led to the development of various methods for reconstructing transmission trees of infectious diseases using whole genome sequence data. However, a fundamental limitation of these approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. This means that the position of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between the sampled pathogens. In this study, the authors introduce the concept of "transmission divergence," defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs, to quantify and compare the useful genetic diversity expected from different pathogens. They simulated outbreak scenarios using two transmission models and found that transmission divergence is generally low for most pathogens, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. This low transmission divergence limits the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using genetic data alone and highlights the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data. The authors demonstrate that genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens, such as RNA viruses, can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, while sequence data of pathogens with lower transmission divergence, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering the informational limitations of genetic data in certain outbreak scenarios and the need to integrate other types of data to improve outbreak reconstruction.
In the fight against dengue virus (DENV), understanding the immune responses that lead to severe disease outcomes versus subclinical infections is crucial. A study was conducted on a cohort of Thai school-aged children, collecting blood samples before and after DENV infection. The pre-infection peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with DENV in vitro, and the secretion of 30 cytokines was measured. The results showed significant differences in cytokine production based on the type of DENV and the occurrence of clinical illness. For instance, IL-15 and MCP-1 were produced at higher levels in PBMC from subjects who later developed symptomatic DENV infection, while IL-6 was produced by all subjects with symptomatic infection versus 59% of those with subclinical infection. Conversely, IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα were secreted at lower levels by PBMC from subjects with symptomatic infection. These findings suggest that pre-existing immune responses to DENV play a role in the clinical outcome of subsequent infection, and the identified clinical-immunological correlations may be useful for evaluating immune responses to dengue vaccines.
