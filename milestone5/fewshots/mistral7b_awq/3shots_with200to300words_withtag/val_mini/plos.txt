Fleas, which transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis that causes the plague, can do so through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). The efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and rodent hosts, but the reasons for this variability are not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated the effect of different rodent blood types on EPT by feeding fleas bacteremic mouse, rat, guinea pig, or gerbil blood and examining the location and characteristics of Yersinia pestis in the digestive tract and its transmissibility.Surprisingly, 10-28% of two rodent flea species that fed on bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood refluxed a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 hours, a phenomenon called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). This was rarely observed in rodent fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER was associated with the accumulation of a dense mixed aggregate of Yersinia pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals that filled the proventriculus.Fleas with PIER were more likely to appear partially blocked during their next feeding attempt, with fresh blood retained within the esophagus. Three days after feeding on bacteremic rat blood, groups of Oropsylla montana transmitted significantly more CFUs than did groups infected using mouse blood, and this enhanced transmission was biofilm-dependent.The findings suggest that EPT results from regurgitation of Yersinia pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut and that EPT and BDT can sometimes overlap. The relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of rats and Sciurids and the slower digestion of their blood may promote regurgitative transmission, which may be one reason why these rodents are particularly prominent in plague ecology.
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have been integrated into the host germline and passed down through generations. Some ERVs have been hypothesized to act as restriction factors against exogenous retroviruses by interfering with their replication. Sheep, which host two oncogenic retroviruses, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), and their related endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs), provide an interesting model system to study retrovirus-host coevolution. In this study, researchers isolated and characterized 27 enJSRV proviruses, which have been integrating into the sheep genome for the past 5-7 million years. Two of these proviruses, enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20, acquired a defective Gag polyprotein that confers a transdominant phenotype, blocking late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses. These transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication. Interestingly, a provirus that can escape the transdominant enJSRVs has recently emerged. This study suggests that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections.Introduction:Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have been integrated into the host germline and passed down through generations. These elements, also known as endogenous retroviruses, follow Mendelian inheritance rules like any other host gene. The continuous accumulation of new retroviral integrations over millions of years, a process called endogenization, has resulted in the genomes of all vertebrates being heavily colonized by ERVs. Most ERVs have accumulated genetic defects that render them unable to express infectious virus or proteins. However, some ERVs are transcriptionally active and have maintained intact open reading frames for some of their genes, raising the possibility that they may be beneficial to their hosts. One proposed explanation for the selection of some ERVs in vertebrates is their ability to provide protection against infection of related exogenous pathogenic retroviruses.Sheep, which host two oncogenic retroviruses, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), and their related endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs), provide an interesting model system to study retrovirus-host coevolution. The history and timing of sheep domestication and breed selection is well documented, making it an excellent system to study the coevolution of retroviruses and their hosts. JSRV and ENTV are two related exogenous pathogenic retroviruses that cause naturally occurring neoplasms of the respiratory tract of sheep. The sheep genome harbors many copies of ERVs highly related to JSRV/ENTV, termed enJSRVs. These elements are abundantly expressed in the genital tract of the ewe, particularly in the endometrial lumenal and glandular epithelia of the uterus and in the trophectoderm of the placenta. enJSRVs possess several biological features that support the idea of a symbiotic relationship with their host. They are critical for reproduction in sheep, and some enJSRVs interfere with the replication of JSRV in vitro by both receptor competition and a mechanism termed JLR, meaning JSRV late restriction.In this study, researchers isolated and characterized the evolutionary history and molecular virology of 27 enJSRV proviruses. They found that two enJSRV proviruses, enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20, entered the host genome in two temporally distinct events and acquired a defective Gag polyprotein that confers a transdominant blocking phenotype. Both of these transdominant enJSRVs became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication. Interestingly, a provirus that can escape the transdominant enJSRV loci has recently emerged. This study provides evidence for sequentially distinct events during evolution that are indicative of an evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses.Conclusion:This study strongly suggests that endogenization and selection of E
The Drosophila embryo's gonad is formed from two distinct cell types: Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells (SGPs). PGCs form at the embryo's posterior during the blastoderm stage and must traverse the midgut wall and migrate through the mesoderm to reach the SGPs. The migration of PGCs is guided by a combination of local repulsive cues and attractive signals emanating from the SGPs. In this study, we investigated the role of the hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) in directing PGC migration.Shf encodes a secreted protein that facilitates long-distance Hh transmission through the proteoglycan matrix after it is released from basolateral membranes of Hh-expressing cells. Shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm, and loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that it is required for PGC migration. Previous studies have shown that the hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in generating the PGC attractant both by the SGPs and by other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. We found that production of this PGC attractant depends upon shf as well as a second hh pathway gene gÎ³1.Furthermore, we present evidence indicating that ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release/transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into and through the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. The potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend upon cholesterol modification.In summary, our findings suggest that the hh pathway gene shf plays a crucial role in the long-distance transmission of Hh and the production of the PGC attractant, which is essential for PGC migration during Drosophila embryogenesis.
In a recent study, we explored the role of adult neurogenesis in a simplified hippocampal memory model, where the network was required to encode and decode memory patterns despite changing input statistics. We found that additive neurogenesis, where new neurons are added to an expanding network, was a more effective adaptation strategy compared to conventional synaptic plasticity and neuronal turnover. In this study, we extended our model to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. We compared network performance across three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. Our results confirmed that additive neurogenesis was a superior adaptation strategy when using realistic, spatially structured input patterns. We also introduced a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporated cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells, which had better overall performance than any one of the three individual strategies. We examined the time course of adult neurogenesis over an animal's lifetime under different hypothetical rearing conditions and identified distinct features that could be tested experimentally. Finally, we showed that place cells could emerge and refine in a realistic manner in our model as a result of the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer.The hippocampus is one of the two neurogenic regions in the adult mammalian brain, with neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus being an additive process where new units are added to an expanding network. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is crucial for the network's ability to adapt to changes in input statistics, such as a change in the external environment. We previously modeled neurogenesis in a simplified memory model of the hippocampus, requiring the network to correctly encode and decode memory patterns under the constraint that the input statistics change over time. We found that additive neurogenesis allowed the network to adapt to changes in input statistics while preserving the retrieval properties of the network and eliminating the problem of interference.In this study, we extended our earlier model to incorporate realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. Grid cells have been well documented in the dorsocaudal region of the medial entorhinal cortex of awake and behaving rats. By directly linking our results to experimental data on grid cell firing and the manner in which those statistics change when the animal enters a new environment, we were able to generate realistic input statistics and evaluate network performance in a computational task that is much more closely related to that of the real hippocampus. This also provided us with a direct analogue of spatial position in our model, allowing us to explore spatial properties of the network such as the appearance and refinement of place cells in a way that was not previously possible.Keywords: computational biology, computational neuroscience.
Pluripotent cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells and primordial germ cells (PGCs), have the unique ability to give rise to all fetal and adult cell lineages. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of these cells is crucial for directing their differentiation and holds promise for cell replacement therapies. In this study, researchers analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and PGCs and identified genes that are upregulated in pluripotent cells both in vitro and in vivo. These genes are enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair.To identify the regulatory motifs that control gene expression in pluripotent cells, researchers developed a novel computational algorithm called CompMoby. This algorithm combines analyses of sequences both aligned and non-aligned between different genomes with a probabilistic segmentation model to systematically predict short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression. CompMoby identified conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, which can act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter and are active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells. Importantly, the activity of these motifs is conserved in human ES cells.One of the identified motifs was shown to be specifically bound by the transcription factor NF-Y, which is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation and is required for ES cell proliferation. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species.
A better understanding of the cellular requirements and mechanisms of hepatitis C virus (HCV) secretion is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies. In this study, researchers combined RNA interference (RNAi) analysis and live cell imaging to gain insights into HCV egress. RNAi studies identified several components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases, VAMP1 vesicles, and adaptor proteins, that are essential for HCV secretion. Live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking revealed that it moves along microtubules to the cell periphery and associates with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles. The findings provide new insights into the host cofactors of HCV egress and the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in infected cells.
In this study, researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKLLKLLKKLLKL (LK) and EAALAEALAEALAE (EALA), which have built-in secondary amphiphilicity when forming an alpha-helix. The researchers found that these peptides do not behave as random coils in bulk water or fully formed alpha helices, but rather adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. These conformations provide a basis for conformation-selection and population-shift upon environmental changes. The peptides' response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces, presented by an aggregation partner, can be linked to their inherent alpha-helical tendencies in bulk water. The researchers also found that the peptides' aggregation behavior is strongly affected by the presence or absence of an interface and is influenced by their surface charge and hydrophobicity. Overall, this study sheds light on the complex folding and aggregation equilibria of these systems and the role of interfaces in shaping their conformational behavior.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of a virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization, disease, and transmission, both with and without co-infection with influenza A virus (IAV). The goal was to identify vulnerable points in the multiple stages of pneumococcal pathogenesis, specifically population bottlenecks. The findings revealed that during IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. The study demonstrated that viral infection and the TLR-dependent innate immune responses it stimulates are required to control pneumococcal contagion.
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can spread through both cell-free and cell-to-cell contact. However, the importance of cell-to-cell transmission and its vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors is not well understood. In this study, researchers used specific experimental methods to distinguish between the two transmission routes and found that the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and entry inhibitors varies depending on their mode of action. While gp41-directed agents remain effective, CD4 binding site (CD4bs) directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, lose potency during cell-to-cell transmission. This suggests that CD4bs mAbs act preferentially by blocking free virus transmission while allowing HIV to spread through cell-to-cell contacts. This finding provides a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs-directed antibody responses in vivo.Introduction:HIV spreads efficiently both in a cell-free state and from cell to cell. The virus can transmit from infected to non-infected cells through virological synapses, which are organized contact areas that concentrate cellular entry receptors and virions, and through transient cell-cell contacts and longer-range intercellular interactions such as nanotubes and filopodia. Cell-cell transmission is thought to be a relevant, if not dominant, mode of virus dissemination in infected individuals. However, the relative contribution of cell-cell and cell-free virus transmission in acquisition of HIV infection and viral dissemination during human infection remains undefined. This gap in knowledge poses a conceptual problem for neutralizing antibody-based HIV vaccine and entry inhibitor design.Neutralizing antibodies recognize epitopes on the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 that are accessible in the oligomeric form of the HIV envelope protein. Neutralization occurs by blocking virion attachment to host cell receptors or by inhibiting membrane fusion. It is unclear to what extent the relatively enclosed environment of the viral synapse is able to protect the virus from humoral immunity. Previous attempts to determine the capacity of individual neutralizing antibodies to inhibit cell-cell transmission have yielded conflicting results, suggesting it is entirely inefficient, less efficient than inhibition of cell-free infection, or indeed equally efficient as inhibition of cell-free infection. These discrepancies may reflect differences in cell types studied and experimental procedures.To derive a definite conclusion on the capacity of neutralizing antibodies to block cell-cell transmission of HIV, the researchers used assay systems that allow overcoming several limitations and explicitly monitoring cell-cell transmission. The comprehensive in vitro analysis of inhibitor activity during cell-free and cell-cell virus transmission provides a necessary first step towards the definition of the in vivo relevance of the respective transmission modes and ensuing requirements for their inhibition by vaccine-induced antibody responses and entry inhibitors.Keywords: HIV, AIDS, cell-cell transmission, neutralizing antibodies, entry inhibitors, gp120, gp41, virological synapse, nanotubes, filopodia.
Genetic testing for complex diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, has become increasingly popular, but it is unclear whether the results will be useful clinically. Previous studies have primarily used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC, to evaluate the predictive value of genetic tests. However, AUC has limitations and should be complemented by other measures. In this study, we propose a novel statistical framework to assess the performance of genetic risk prediction models. We demonstrate that, given the overall disease probability and the level of variance in total liability explained by genetic variants, we can estimate various prediction metrics, including AUC, mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of the population at the highest risk, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. We also provide methods to construct graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, such as the ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve. Our results show that the proposed framework accurately estimates the performance of risk models and can be applied to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants.Introduction:Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases, raising hope for individualized risk prediction based on genomic profiles. However, the clinical utility of such tests remains controversial. Several companies offer disease risk estimates based on genomic profiles, but it is essential to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models. A high level of statistical significance does not necessarily equate to good predictive power. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC, is a popular method to assess the discriminatory ability of a test. AUC is the area under the plot of sensitivity versus 1-specificity and represents the probability that the test score is higher for a case than a non-case. However, AUC has limitations and is not the only way to assess the performance of a prediction model. In this study, we propose a novel statistical framework to connect different measures of predictive power together. Our framework is based on the liability threshold model, which assumes an underlying liability that is normally distributed. Affected individuals have a liability above the threshold. We show that, given the overall disease prevalence and total variance in liability explained by the set of susceptibility variants, it is possible to estimate analytically various prediction indices and construct graphs to visualize the performance of risk models.Keywords: Genetics and genomics, complex traits, epidemiology, genetics of disease, preventive medicine, bioinformatics.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene, which is the homolog of the human XPD gene, plays a crucial role in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Mutations in RAD3, specifically rad3-101 and rad3-102, have been identified and they exhibit partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies suggested that the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3-101 and rad3-102 strains is due to persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. However, these studies did not detect the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. In this study, the authors further characterized these events using a system that recovers the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. They found that both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. The majority of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs), while the remainder reflects DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. The authors mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. They found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. Additionally, there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. The authors suggest that a subset of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
A proposed budget cut to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus could leave the country unprepared to handle new emerging diseases and manage existing ones. Our study used a mathematical model to simulate the consequences of delayed control responses to a dengue epidemic in Cairns, Queensland, Australia, due to halted mosquito surveillance. The results showed that halting mosquito surveillance could increase the management costs of epidemics by up to tenfold compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The findings provide a science-based justification for reconsidering the proposed CDC budget cut and emphasize the importance of improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance.Introduction:The proposed $26.7 million budget cut to the CDC vector-borne diseases program in the 2011 U.S. fiscal year could significantly impact surveillance and research activities for diseases already circulating in the U.S., including dengue and West Nile virus, and hinder the ability to detect and respond to other mosquito-transmitted pathogens such as Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, and chikungunya virus. Surveillance is crucial for infectious disease control, guiding health agencies' response to threats, optimizing resources, and providing valuable information for health providers and policymakers. In this study, we coupled a mathematical model with cost analysis to evaluate the economic impact of different response scenarios to the introduction of a vector-transmitted pathogen of public health importance into an economically developed urban environment.Keywords: evidence-based healthcare/health services research and economics, infectious diseases/epidemiology and control of infectious diseases, public health and epidemiology/health policy.
Insulator elements are crucial for regulating gene expression by preventing inappropriate enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF, a zinc-finger protein, is a well-known enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, but its role in Drosophila has only recently been explored. In this study, researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation and genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites in the Drosophila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the Bithorax complex (BX-C), and the Antennapedia complex. They found that CTCF binds to all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for their functioning. The identified CTCF binding sites precisely map to known insulator elements, such as Mcp, Fab-6, Fab-8, Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of CTCF in insulator function and the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila.
Ebola viruses, a family of highly lethal zoonotic pathogens, possess longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due to long 5â² and 3â² untranslated regions (UTRs) present in their seven transcriptional units. The functions of these UTRs have not been fully understood. In this study, researchers investigated the role of the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) 5â²-UTRs in translation using reporter assays. They found that the 5â²-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function but differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. The 5â²-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a Î²-actin 5â²-UTR. The L 5â²-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF (pORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 5â²-UTR. The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a "weak" Kozak sequence, and suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2Î± was phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To directly address the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the L uAUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10-100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. These findings identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression and demonstrate their relevance to virus replication, providing potential therapeutic targets.
Rabies is a fatal viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals, including dogs. The disease presents with two clinical forms: furious and paralytic. While the furious form is characterized by aggression and hyperactivity, the paralytic form is marked by muscle weakness and paralysis. The mechanisms behind the differences between these two forms are not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated the spread of rabies virus in the nervous system of naturally infected dogs by measuring the amount of viral antigen in neuronal cell processes. They found that the amount of viral antigen in cell processes decreases in a rostral direction, following the pattern of viral antigen in neuronal cell bodies. However, there is a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, suggesting that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form. Additionally, greater amounts of antigen were seen in cell processes in dogs with the furious form, at all anatomic levels examined. These findings suggest that intracellular transport of the virus may be a factor in the differences between the furious and paralytic forms of rabies. Possible mechanisms for this difference could be host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, which could be cytokine-mediated due to greater inflammation in the paralytic form.
14-3-3 proteins play a crucial role in regulating the function of proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, particularly at stalled replication forks. They do this by controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1, a nuclease that processes stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective cells. In the absence of 14-3-3 proteins, Exo1 fails to be hyperphosphorylated, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects. Electrophoresis studies show that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. The findings suggest that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress.
A mosquito-borne virus called Sindbis virus (SINV) is the cause of polyarthritis and rash in humans, known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. This virus is primarily found in tropical and sub-tropical countries, but also occurs in northern Europe, where it is suggested to cause regular outbreaks every seven years. To objectively investigate the occurrence of these outbreaks, researchers collected and analyzed mosquitoes from an endemic area in Sweden during the years before, during, and after the hypothesized 2002 outbreak year. They found that the infection rate of SINV in the main enzootic vector, Culex torrentium/pipiens, and the bridge vector, Aedes cinereus, significantly increased in 2002 compared to the previous and following years. The genetic analysis of the isolated SINV strains revealed local maintenance of four clades in the River DalÃ¤lven floodplains over the years. These findings suggest that increased SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes is a valuable marker for further studying the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks and the mechanisms behind it. Understanding the periodicity of SINV outbreaks can help public health authorities inform the public about the risk for mosquito-borne infection and disease, allowing people to take preventative measures to reduce the number of mosquito bites and decrease the risk for infection.
In the post-genomic era, high-throughput technologies, such as transcriptional profiling by microarrays, have become popular for identifying genes that are differentially expressed in response to various environmental conditions. However, it is unclear whether differential gene expression is predictive of functional importance. In this study, researchers used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to investigate the functional significance of genes differentially expressed in response to different soil bacteria. They identified candidate genes that affect metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting that similar genes could influence nematode community dynamics in natural systems. The researchers then showed that most of these genes contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment. Although these bacteria may not be natural food sources for C. elegans, changes in food source, as can occur in environmental disturbance, can have significant effects on gene expression and fitness. The researchers also used regression analysis to demonstrate that the degree of differential gene expression between two bacterial environments predicted the magnitude of the effect of gene loss on life history traits in those environments. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that there is predictive power for the effects of mutant phenotypes in an environment-specific manner, suggesting that the relative level of transcription can be informative about the relative contributions to function, at least for life history traits. Additionally, the examination of C. elegans gene function in new environments uncovered new phenotypes for previously studied genes and genes that had not been shown to have obvious phenotypes under standard laboratory conditions.Keywords: ecology, global change ecology, gene discovery, gene expression, functional genomics, innate immunity.
Centromeres are essential structures in the nucleus that help attach chromosomes to the spindle fibers during cell division. While the DNA sequence of centromeres is not crucial for their function, RNA transcribed from centromeres plays a key role in the epigenetic marking system. In this study, researchers investigated the role of a specific protein, Centromere Protein C (CENPC), in maize centromeres. They found that CENPC has both DNA-binding and RNA-binding capacities, and that the RNA binding is crucial for efficient centromere localization. The binding domain for both DNA and RNA is located in the exon duplication region of CENPC. These findings suggest that CENPC and RNA work together to direct CENH3 to newly replicated centromere DNA, providing a mechanism for the involvement of RNA in centromere specification.
Phasing the genome, or determining the maternal and paternal origins of each nucleotide, is crucial for understanding genetic variations and their impact on health and disease. However, most human genome sequencing initiatives overlook this important step due to the costs and complexities involved. In this study, researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes using the publicly available "Genome-In-A-Bottle" (GIAB) reference genome as a benchmark. The methods included both laboratory-based assays and purely computational approaches. The study found that a hybrid approach using population-based phasing, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provided the most accurate and efficient results. The findings have implications for the development of technologies in regeneration, aging, and cancer research.Introduction:Human whole genome sequencing (WGS) has become increasingly accessible due to advances in DNA sequencing technology. However, challenges remain, such as identifying structural variations and distinguishing cis and trans combinations of variants, which requires phase information. Phase information, or knowing the unique nucleotide content of each copy of a homologous chromosome pair, is essential for understanding genetically-mediated phenomena and dissecting evolutionary and population genetics phenomena. Obtaining phase information is non-trivial, and strategies include laboratory protocols, de novo assembly computational methods, and population haplotype frequency information. The most straightforward method for obtaining phase information is sequencing the parents, but even with parental sequence information, there are challenges.Methods:The researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes using the publicly available GIAB reference genome as a benchmark. The methods included laboratory-based assays, such as those using different sequencing platforms and parental genotypes, and computational approaches that sought to reconstruct phase information from general sequencing reads and constructs or population-level haplotype frequency information.Results:The study found that a hybrid approach using population-based phasing, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provided the most accurate and efficient results. The researchers also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which included regions of low polymorphism or SNV density.Conclusion:The findings of this study have implications for the development of technologies in regeneration, aging, and cancer research. Understanding the impact of cis and trans combinations of variants requires phase information, which is essential for dissecting genetically-mediated phenomena and evolutionary and population genetics phenomena. The hybrid approach identified in this study provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes.Keywords:human genome sequencing, phase information, haplotype, genome analysis, genetic mapping, population genetics, computational biology, DNA sequencing, genetics, biology and life sciences, genomics, molecular biology, research and analysis methods, nucleotide sequencing, biochemistry, haplotypes, nucleic acids, heredity, genetics.
Sooty mangabeys, a natural host for Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), exhibit non-pathogenic infection despite robust virus replication. A novel CCR5 allele, CCR5Î2, was identified in a large sooty mangabey colony, which encodes a truncated molecule that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. This allele was present in 26% of the colony, along with a 3% frequency of another CCR5 deletion allele, CCR5Î24, which also abrogates surface expression. The mutant allele was also present in wild sooty mangabeys in West Africa. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells displayed a gradient of CCR5 expression across genotype groups, which was highly significant for CD8+ cells. Remarkably, the prevalence of natural SIVsmm infection was not significantly different in animals lacking functional CCR5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type animals. Furthermore, animals lacking functional CCR5 had robust plasma viral loads, which were only modestly lower than wild-type animals. SIVsmm primary isolates infected both homozygous mutant and wild-type PBMC in a CCR5-independent manner in vitro, and Envs from both CCR5-null and wild-type infected animals used CXCR6, GPR15, and GPR1 in addition to CCR5 in transfected cells. These data suggest that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in SM that are homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles, and that the extent of alternative coreceptor use in SM with CCR5 wild-type alleles is uncertain. The findings raise the possibility of novel CCR5-negative target cells that may be more expendable than CCR5+ cells, enabling the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of extremely restricted CCR5 expression seen in SM and several other natural host species.
In the animal kingdom, individuals choose their mates based on traits that reflect their reproductive potential. However, it is not well understood why certain traits are used for mate quality assessment or how they reflect it. Previous research has shown that insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, affects female sexual attractiveness in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, researchers investigated the mechanisms behind these effects and found that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells is integrated by pheromone-producing cells called oenocytes. Functional ovaries were required for the effects of insulin signaling on attractiveness, and manipulations of insulin signaling specifically in late follicle cells recapitulated the effects of global manipulations. Interestingly, modulation of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with the ovary. Furthermore, all investigated tissue-specific insulin signaling manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity in the corresponding direction, indicating a link between fecundity and attractiveness cues. The cues themselves, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded distinctly to fat body and follicle cell manipulations, indicating independent readouts of the pathway activity from these two tissues. Overall, this study describes a system in which female attractiveness results from an apparent connection between attractiveness cues and an organismal state of high fecundity, both of which are created by lowered insulin signaling in the fat body and increased insulin signaling in late follicle cells.Keywords: insulin signaling, fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, fat body, ovarian follicle cells, pheromones, cuticular hydrocarbons, fecundity, attractiveness, mate choice, animal models, endocrinology, reproductive system, animal physiology, biochemistry, population biology, zoology.
Breast cancers that are negative for the clinical markers Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1), Progesterone Receptor (PGR), and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) are often referred to as triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype. Defects in the Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways are linked to both TNBC and Basal-like subtypes. In mice, the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways can suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution, and the simultaneous inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium leads to highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors share features of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, including poor differentiation, heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses reveal that the tumors have attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low subtypes. These findings suggest that the combined inactivation of Rb, p53, and Brca1 in mammary epithelium may be a useful model for understanding the complex cellular biology and behavior of aggressive breast cancers.Introduction:Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, and the development of effective treatments requires a better understanding of its cellular and molecular etiology. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the absence of the clinical markers Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1), Progesterone Receptor (PGR), and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are often referred to as Basal-like, but the two classifications are not identical. TNBCs exhibit diverse clinical behavior, morphology, and molecular biology. They are insensitive to endocrine therapy and HER2 antagonists, but they are sensitive to chemotherapy. However, long-term patient outcomes are poor due to high rates of relapse and acquired chemoresistance. Mouse models that accurately mimic the complexity of TNBC are essential for defining their diverse cellular biology and for rigorously evaluating new drug candidates.Basal-like breast cancers frequently inactivate three tumor suppressors: Rb (RB1), p53 (TP53), and BRCA1. p53 is mutated in 20-30% of human breast cancers, and defective pathway intermediates also increase breast cancer risk. Nearly all Basal-like cancers with BRCA1 mutation have concomitant p53 mutation. Germline BRCA1 mutation predisposes early-onset breast cancers that are often triple-negative and associated with Basal-like tumors. BRCA1 mutation accounts for nearly half of familial breast cancers, but it is also down-regulated in sporadic breast tumors without germline mutation. The overall effect of BRCA1 loss is likely pleiotropic. The best-studied function of BRCA1 is in orchestrating DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination or non-homologous end-joining. The importance of defective DNA repair in breast cancer is underscored by the observation that all known genes associated with inherited forms of the disease safeguard genomic integrity. BRCA1 also functions as a transcription factor that appears to be required for the differentiation of stem/progenitor cells into mature luminal cells. The pair-wise cooperativity of Brca1 and p53 in mammary tumorigenesis has been studied in mouse models. We have investigated the impact of combined Rb and p53 inactivation on mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. Our motivation for combining Rb inactivation with Brca1 and p53 mutation derives, in part, from the observation that the Rb gene is among the most frequently deleted loci in Brca1/p53-mutated mouse tumors, indicating that Rb is a critical barrier to tumor progression. Rb pathway inactivation is strongly associated with human triple negative breast cancers. A cardinal feature of basal-like breast cancers is the abundant expression of the âproliferation clusterâ genes, which include many E2F-regulated genes that are de-repressed following Rb inactivation. In human breast cancers, reduced pRb activity correlates with higher
Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease, uses a type IV secretion system to inject effector proteins into host cells to manipulate their functions for infection. One such effector, LubX, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets another effector, SidH, for degradation. The delayed delivery of LubX to the host cytoplasm leads to the shutdown of SidH at later stages of infection, demonstrating a sophisticated level of coevolution between the bacterium and the host. This is the first evidence of a "metaeffector," an effector protein that regulates the function of another effector within the host cell.
Inferring regulatory interactions and constructing quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data is a crucial area of research with applications in drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. However, the assumptions underlying these methods, such as mRNA abundance being representative of protein concentrations and the gene expression machinery being equally active across different conditions, are often not valid. In this study, researchers investigated the importance of these assumptions and proposed corrections using a combination of models and experiments. They focused on the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network, measuring protein concentrations and global physiological effects using kinetic models of gene expression. The results showed that correcting for these assumptions led to improved models, with stronger improvements expected for systems with longer protein half-lives and more variable gene expression machinery activity. This approach is broadly applicable for understanding the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks using time-series transcriptome data. The study demonstrated the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.
Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), including Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect over a billion people, primarily in developing countries. Preventive chemotherapy, which involves administering anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the primary method of control. However, this approach does not prevent reinfection. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. We searched multiple databases for relevant studies and extracted information on infection rates pre- and post-treatment, drug administration strategies, and determinants of reinfection risk. Our analysis included 51 studies, which reported STH infection rates of 26-100% at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. To maximize the benefits of preventive chemotherapy, frequent drug administrations and integrated control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation are needed to interrupt transmission. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the determinants of reinfection risk to improve the effectiveness of preventive strategies.Keywords: Soil-transmitted helminths, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, preventive chemotherapy, reinfection, systematic review, meta-analysis.
 Rabies is a deadly disease that can be prevented through prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but access to this life-saving intervention is often limited, particularly in low-income countries where the majority of human rabies deaths occur. Intradermal (ID) vaccination, which uses smaller volumes of vaccine, is a cost-effective alternative to intramuscular (IM) administration and could help mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce costs. This study analyzed the cost-effectiveness of different PEP vaccination regimens and found that ID vaccination is a cost-effective intervention, saving between $200 and less than $60 per death averted. Switching to ID vaccination could also help make PEP more affordable and accessible for those most in need. The study presents financing mechanisms to support the implementation of ID vaccination and concludes that a universal switch to ID delivery would lead to a reduction in human rabies deaths and save healthcare providers money.
 In Uganda, there are active foci of both chronic and acute Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), with the acute form traditionally limited to southeast Uganda and the chronic form to the northwest. However, the acute form has been spreading rapidly to new districts, posing a significant risk to human health. Cattle act as long-term reservoirs of human infective T. b. rhodesiense, which shows few signs of morbidity. This study examines the relationship between human T. b. rhodesiense infection and T. brucei s.l. circulating in cattle at the village level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda. The study found that villages with reported sleeping sickness cases had a higher odds of T. brucei s.l. infection in cattle, and cattle age was also a significant factor. Additionally, the study found that village sleeping sickness status had a significant effect on the detection of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle herd. Overall, a higher than average T. brucei s.l. prevalence in a village herd was associated with a higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense being detected. Understanding the relationship between infected cattle and infected individuals is crucial for an appropriate response to the risk posed to the community from animals infected with human pathogens in a village setting.
Dietary restriction (DR) is a well-known intervention that extends lifespan and delays age-related diseases in various species. The molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are not fully understood, but the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is known to play a role. TOR is a conserved protein kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth factors. In Caenorhabditis elegans, HIF-1, a transcription factor complex involved in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response, has been identified as a target of the TOR pathway. In this study, researchers found that HIF-1 deficiency extends lifespan in C. elegans, which overlaps with the lifespan extension observed upon inhibition of the TOR pathway. This effect is nutrient-dependent, as hif-1 loss-of-function mutants extend lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but fail to show lifespan extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminishes the lifespan extension under DR. This deficiency is rescued by tissue-specific expression of egl-9 in specific neurons and muscles. The lifespan extension by hif-1 or DR is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress. These results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway.Keywords: dietary restriction, TOR pathway, HIF-1, Caenorhabditis elegans, longevity, nutrient-dependent, ER stress, IRE-1.
Acetogens, a type of microorganism that can ferment a wide range of substrates, including hydrogen and carbon dioxide, are ideal candidates for the production of commodity chemicals due to their sustainability. However, designing advanced strategies for acetogens is currently limited by our incomplete understanding of their physiology and the inability to accurately predict their phenotypes. In this study, researchers reconstructed a novel genome-scale metabolic and gene expression (ME) model of the acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii to gain new insights into its biology. This model, the first of its kind for a Gram-positive bacterium, captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways to synthesize RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology by explicitly predicting RNA and protein abundances, enabling the exploration of cofactor requirements. The researchers used the model to reveal how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens and accurately predicted the secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol. Predicting overflow metabolism, such as glycerol formation, is of particular interest as it enables new design strategies for acetogens, broadening their metabolic capability. Additionally, the prediction and experimental validation of changing secretion rates based on different metal availability opens the window into fermentation optimization and provides new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.Keywords: Acetogens, biotechnology, commodity chemicals, sustainability, metabolic and gene expression model, Clostridium ljungdahlii, metabolic pathways, energy conservation, protein allocation, media composition, fermentation products, overflow metabolism, glycerol, ethanol, acetate, metals, trace metals, proteome utilization, carbon flux.
In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) protein plays a crucial role in controlling flowering time in response to blue light. CRY2 interacts with the bHLH transcription factor CIB1 to activate the transcription of the florigen gene FT. CIB1 specifically binds to non-canonical E-box sequences in the FT promoter in vivo, despite having a higher affinity for canonical E-box sequences in vitro. In this study, researchers found that CRY2 also interacts with CIB5 in response to blue light, and that CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 act redundantly to activate the transcription of FT. CIB1 and other CIB proteins form heterodimers, and some of these heterodimers have a higher binding affinity to the non-canonical E-box in the in vitro DNA-binding assays. This explains why CIB1 and other CIBs bind to the canonical E-box with a higher affinity in vitro but associate with the non-canonical E-boxes at the FT promoter in vivo. The expression of CIB proteins is regulated specifically by blue light, and the findings suggest that multiple CIB proteins act redundantly in the CRY2-mediated blue light signaling pathway to promote floral initiation.
Enteric bacterial infections, such as those caused by Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), can lead to severe diarrhea and even life-threatening kidney disease. EHEC uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins, called effectors, into host cells. These effectors disrupt normal functions of intestinal epithelial cells, contributing to diarrheal disease and bacterial transmission. In this study, researchers identified two EHEC effectors, NleH1 and NleH2, that bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of NF-ÎºB transcriptional complexes. The binding occurs in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus, and is independent of the kinase activity of NleH1 and NleH2. NleH1 inhibits RPS3-dependent transcription, while NleH2 stimulates it. The researchers suggest that these effectors may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes. This finding provides new insights into how bacterial effectors manipulate host cells and could have implications for understanding other infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.
High-altitude regions, such as the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau, have presented unique challenges for human populations due to the reduced oxygen levels. For millennia, people have adapted to these extreme environments, resulting in distinct physiological, circulatory, and hematological traits. While these adaptations have been studied physiologically, the underlying genetic basis remains unknown. In this study, researchers conducted a genome scan to identify genes that show evidence of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in the Andean and Tibetan populations. They applied four population genetic statistics to identify candidate genes and gene regions with previously unknown functions related to altitude phenotypes. The results revealed distinct patterns of genetic adaptation between the two populations, with both showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. One gene, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), which is involved in cellular oxygen sensing, showed evidence of positive selection in both populations. However, the pattern of variation for this gene differed between the two populations. The findings suggest that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These results provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.Introduction:Human populations have adapted to various environments throughout history, with high-altitude regions presenting unique challenges due to reduced oxygen levels.

Machupo virus (MACV) and Junin virus (JUNV) are two arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever in South America. A recombinant, chimeric MACV (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) expressing the glycoprotein from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of JUNV has been shown to be attenuated in mice and protects against lethal MACV challenge. A single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) of this chimeric virus, equivalent to the F427I attenuating mutation in Cd#1 GPC, also attenuates MACV but is genetically unstable. To investigate which domains of Cd#1 GPC are necessary for successful attenuation of MACV, three rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of MACV GPC with different modifications were generated: MCg1 (ectodomain of MACV GPC alone), MCg2 (ectodomain of MACV GPC with the F438I substitution in the TMD), and MCg3 (ectodomain of MACV GPC with the TMD of Cd#1). All rMACVs grew similarly in cultured cells, but MCg1 showed significant reduction in lethality in mice and was detected in brains and spleens, associated with tissue inflammation. MCg2 and MCg3 did not cause detectable infection in mice and produced neutralizing antibodies against Cd#1. These results suggest that each domain of GPC plays a role in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC.
A new rapid diagnostic test, the Dengue Early Rapid, for detecting dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen in serum samples has been developed and evaluated in combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test. The study was conducted in Vietnam and Malaysia with a total of 551 samples, 398 confirmed positive and 153 negative. The sensitivity and specificity of the Dengue Early Rapid test alone were 69.2% (95% CI: 62.8% to 75.6%) and 96% (95% CI: 92.2% to 99.8%) respectively. When used in combination with the IgM/IgG test, the sensitivity increased to 93.0%. The test showed clear differentiation between antigen and antibody markers at different days post-onset of illness. This combination of tests can significantly improve the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extend the window of detection to include very early acute samples. The Dengue Early Rapid test, along with the IgM/IgG test, can enhance the clinical utility of rapid immunochromatographic testing for dengue.
A new study has identified a bacterial protein called TirS, which is carried by a mobile genetic element in Staphylococcus aureus. TirS is a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain mimic that inhibits TLR signaling in eukaryotic cells, downregulating the NF-ÎºB pathway and reducing the activity of neutrophils and macrophages. The study found that TirS is located within the staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance but not always carrying the mecA gene. Interestingly, sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid increase TirS expression. The epidemiological studies showed no link between TirS and clinical presentation but identified a selective advantage with a SCCmec element carrying SCC fusC/tirS. These findings suggest that the ability of S. aureus to evade the host immune system and cause infections may be linked to the presence of TirS.Toll/interleukin-1 receptors (TLRs) are essential for initiating and propagating the eukaryotic innate immune response. The TIR domain, a cytoplasmic component of TLRs, plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions and activating transcription factors such as NF-ÎºB. The TIR domain is a target for bacterial evasion mechanisms, and the identification of bacterial TIR homologues has shed light on these mechanisms.The study focused on TirS, a TIR mimic found in Staphylococcus aureus, which interferes with TLR2-induced MAPK and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways and enhances bacterial survival within the host. TirS was found in 12% of MRSA and MSSA strains and was invariably located within the SCC element, which also carries the fusC and mecA genes. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid induced overexpression of tirS.The results of the study suggest that TirS modulates bacterial virulence through attenuation of host inflammatory responses during infection. This is the first description of a TIR homolog protein carried by a mobile genetic element conferring resistance to antibiotics, which may contribute to the ability of S. aureus to survive and establish a critical population size.Keywords: Staphylococcus aureus, Toll-like receptors, TIR domain, TLR signaling, bacterial evasion, fusidic acid, fusC gene, mobile genetic elements, SCCmec, NF-ÎºB, neutrophils, macrophages, inflammatory responses, antibiotic resistance.
 Protein N-terminal acetylation is a common modification found in various organisms, including insects and humans. This modification occurs co-translationally, where the initiator methionine is removed and replaced with an acetyl group. While the enzymes involved in this process have been studied, the biological functions of N-terminal acetylation are not well understood. In this study, researchers analyzed N-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and identified over 1,200 mature protein N-termini. They extracted the X PX rule, which indicates that a proline at position one or two of a nascent protein prevents N-terminal acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation. The researchers applied this strategy to express mutated proteins in cell lines and flies, providing a straightforward method to systematically study the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylation in cells and whole organisms. The X PX rule is proposed to be of general validity in lower and higher eukaryotes, making it a useful tool for studying the function of N-terminal acetylation in various species.
Exosomes, small vesicles released by cells, have been shown to play a role in viral infections by transferring viral and host factors to recipient cells, modulating the recipient's response and facilitating productive infection. In this study, researchers investigated the role of exosomes in Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. They found that EV71 infection led to increased exosome secretion and selective packaging of viral RNA and miR-146a into exosomes. The exosomal viral RNA could replicate in a new cell, while the exosomal miR-146a suppressed the type I interferon response in the target cell, allowing for viral replication. Additionally, the study identified the involvement of IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs) in regulating EV71-induced exosome secretion. Furthermore, the exosomal viral RNA exhibited differential tissue accumulation compared to free virus particles. Overall, this research provides evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which facilitates exosomal EV71 RNA replication by suppressing the type I interferon response.
Recent experiments have shown that the interaction between chromatin loops plays a crucial role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. However, these findings call for a modeling approach to systematically understand how changes in loop connection patterns, distance, and communication forms affect gene expression variability. In this study, we present a mechanistic model that maps three fundamental patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of stochastic transcription. Our results reveal that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, while alternating loops have the opposite effect. We also compare the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression and find that the former performs better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise, but this control is distance-dependent and there is a limit loop length beyond which the difference in effect between the two communication forms almost disappears. Our analysis and results support the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis.Introduction:Gene expression is regulated by regulatory elements, which can be divided into two families: those with the distance from the transcription start site being less than 1kb and those with the distance being much more than 1kb. Complexity in transcription activation arises from the ordered interactions among regulatory elements, including the formation of DNA loops and interactions between DNA loops. These interactions are essential for many cellular functions and have been identified as a key factor underlying the observed phenotypic variability of genetically identical cells in homogeneous environments. In eukaryotic genomes, enhancers can be several hundreds of kilobases away from the promoter they regulate, and the intervening DNA can contain other promoters and other enhancers. Enhancers activate promoters by directly contacting binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-modifying enzymes via DNA looping. The interaction between DNA elements can either assist enhancer-promoter looping by bringing the enhancer and the promoter closer together or interfere with enhancer-promoter looping by placing them in separate loop domains. DNA elements may form chromatin loops in different manners, such as promoter-tethering elements in Drosophila that allow activation by specific enhancers over long distances.Previous studies have shown that DNA looping can maintain a stable lysogenic state, speed up the search process, enhance lysogenic CI transcription in phage lambda, increase the range of bistability in a stochastic model of the lac genetic switch, and enhance or suppress transcriptional noise depending on conditions. However, these studies have treated the looping mechanism as a local role. Recent chromatin capture technologies, such as Chromosome Conformation Capture, have shown that enhancers and promoters are connected in a highly complex network of DNA-looping interactions. Long-range gene regulation in eukaryotic cells involves spatial interactions between transcriptional elements, with intervening chromatin looping out. In this study, we will justify the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis by modeling and analysis.The classic models of gene expression assume direct spatial contact between a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter. However, recent chromatin capture technologies have shown that enhancers and promoters are connected in a highly complex network of DNA-looping interactions. For example, long-range gene regulation in eukaryotic cells involves spatial interactions between transcriptional elements, with intervening chromatin looping out. Two well-characterized DNA-looping proteins, Lac repressor and phage Î» CI, were used to measure interactions between pairs of long DNA loops in E. coli cells in three possible topological arrangements of two pairs of interacting sites on DNA: side-by-side loops, nested loops, and alternating loops. They found that the first loop pair does not affect each other, the second pair assists each other's formation, and the third pair, where one looping element is placed within the other DNA loop, inhibits each other's formation. Combining loop assistance and loop interference can provide strong specificity in long-range interactions. Another related yet important work is the observation that when a pair of repressors and their binding sites are in between the enhancer and the promoter, the gene expression level is not lowered but is raised. For this counter-intuitive phenomenon, it was conjectured that this repressor pair shortens the distance between the enhancer and promoter pair, leading to the rise of the expression level. Another interesting conjecture is on communication between enhancers and promoters. The related questions are what form the enhancer-promoter communication takes, when this takes place, and whether this is the same for all classes of enhancers. This conjecture was put forward as early as in 1
Understanding the dynamic behavior of large networks is crucial in systems and synthetic biology, but predicting this behavior from the composing modules is still a challenge due to context-dependent behavior. One cause of context-dependence is retroactivity, a phenomenon that influences the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules in non-trivial ways. In this study, we propose a framework to analyze gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. We define three retroactivity matrices - internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity - to quantify the effect of intramodular and intermodular connections on a module's dynamics. These matrices can be computed from macroscopic parameters and the modules' topology. By using these matrices and the dynamics of modules in isolation, we can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. We illustrate the implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs and provide a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be used to evaluate the modularity of natural networks and to establish design guidelines for minimizing retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.Introduction:Gene transcription networks are usually modeled as the interconnection of fundamental building blocks called transcriptional components. Each component takes a number of transcription factors (TFs) as inputs and produces a single TF as an output. The input TFs form complexes with promoter sites in the transcriptional component to regulate the production of the output TF. In a transcription network, a transcriptional component is represented by a node, and a network is a set of interconnected nodes where a node represents the transcriptional component producing a TF. Modules are a set of connected nodes that communicate with each other by having TFs produced in one module regulate the expression of TFs produced in a different module.When a node is inside the module, we call the corresponding TF an internal TF, and when it is outside the module, we call it an external TF. We identify external TFs that are parents to internal TFs as inputs to the module. Let xi denote the concentration vector of internal TFs, and let ui and Ci denote the TF-promoter complexes, respectively. The dynamics of the module can be written as equation (1) in the paper, which we call the isolated dynamics of a module.However, when a module is inserted into a network, we call the context of the module, and the dynamics of the species in the module (xi and Ci) and in the context (xbar and Cbar) can be written as equation (3) in the paper. The upper left block matrix in the equation is zero as DNA is assumed to be a conserved species. The off-diagonal block matrices in the upper right block matrix are zero as and encapsulate the binding/unbinding reactions in the module and its context, respectively. The stoichiometry matrix represents how internal TFs of the module participate in binding/unbinding reactions in the context of the module. With describing the effective rate of change of due to intermodular binding reactions, we obtain equation (4) in the paper, which we call the connected dynamics of a module. We refer to as the retroactivity to the output of the module, encompassing retroactivity applied to the module due to the context of the module. Similarly, we call the retroactivity to the input of a module, representing retroactivity originating inside the module. The general interconnection of a group of modules can be treated similarly.For example, when a module is not connected to its context, its output is periodic, but upon interconnection with its context, the output of the module changes significantly, leading to a dramatic departure of the dynamics of the module from its behavior in isolation. Retroactivity significantly alters the dynamic behavior of modules after interconnection, and it cannot be neglected if accurate prediction of temporal dynamics is required. However, model (4) provides little analytical insight into how measurable parameters and interconnection topology affect retroactivity. The aim of this paper is to provide a model that captures the effects of retroactivity, unlike standard regulatory network models of the same dimension based on Hill functions. Specifically, we seek a model that explicitly describes the change in the dynamics of a module once it is arbitrarily connected to other modules in the network. This model is only a function of measurable biochemical parameters, TF concentrations, and interconnection topology.Keywords: systems biology, synthetic biology, biology.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common and deadly form of lung cancer, with a 5-year survival rate as low as 1% for advanced stages. For patients with resectable disease, the choice of preoperative chemotherapy is crucial for eliminating micrometastases and improving operability. In this study, a mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment was used to estimate the plausible value range of the cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens for NSCLC. The model takes into account cancer mechanisms such as uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. The methodology uses tumor volumetric data at two time points and considers the effect of the tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. The volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis were identified as key features for more accurate estimates. The methodology was applied to the retrospective data of 13 NSCLC patients who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The model provides a quantitative framework for estimating the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies, and correlation studies of these estimates with the molecular profile of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
The Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, motor impairment, and disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. The syndrome is linked to mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, which is responsible for TH transport. To understand the underlying mechanisms of AHDS, researchers have studied MCT8 knockout mice, but they failed to exhibit the neurological and behavioral symptoms of the human condition. To address this, researchers generated an MCT8 knockout zebrafish using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) gene editing. The elimination of MCT8 led to decreased TH receptor expression and neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light, increased sleep time, and impaired myelin-related gene expression and neuron development. These findings suggest that MCT8 plays a crucial role in neural circuit assembly and sensory and motor control. Additionally, TH analogs were able to restore some of the neurological deficiencies in the zebrafish model, providing potential therapeutic options for AHDS patients.

Subdividing a population into smaller demes can help accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys or plateaus in a rugged fitness landscape. This effect, known as the "shifting balance theory," was first proposed by Sewall Wright and has been a subject of debate in evolutionary biology. In this study, we investigate the role of subdivision with global migration alone, without additional effects such as demic size changes or extinction and refounding. We use a minimal and generic model to determine the conditions under which subdivision accelerates fitness valley or plateau crossing. Our results show that isolated demes must be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. We also investigate the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. Our findings demonstrate that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus over a wide range of parameters, both with respect to a non-subdivided population and with respect to a single deme. Our results provide insights into the quantitative conditions necessary for subdivision to facilitate evolutionary progress in natural systems.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a crucial structure in the regulation of molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope, allowing for selective transport on the order of milliseconds and the length scale of tens of nanometers. The mechanism of this transport process remains elusive, but it is believed that hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and FG repeat domains play a central role. In this study, researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure to better understand the transport mechanism. The model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is approximately 2.6 milliseconds, and that the cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall where it interacts with the FG-layer. The kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. The model also suggests that cytoplasmic filaments play a defining role in the selectivity barrier. This study provides a foundation for future research into the biophysical details of nucleocytoplasmic transport.The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a crucial structure in the regulation of molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope, allowing for selective transport on the order of milliseconds and the length scale of tens of nanometers. Despite its importance, the mechanism of this transport process remains elusive. The NPC is composed of about 30 distinct proteins, collectively called nucleoporins, and individual nups are related to several human diseases. Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) is a complex process that involves the interaction of karyopherins (kaps) with FG repeat domains, which are natively unfolded domains found in almost 30% of nups.To better understand the transport mechanism, researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure. This model is based on an extensive literature survey and the application of polymer physics principles. The model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is approximately 2.6 milliseconds, and that the cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall where it interacts with the FG-layer. The kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. The model also suggests that cytoplasmic filaments play a defining role in the selectivity barrier.This study provides a foundation for future research into the biophysical details of nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is important for understanding the mechanisms of disease and for developing new therapeutic approaches.Keywords: nuclear pore complex, nucleocytoplasmic transport, karyopherins, FG repeat domains, coarse-grained model.
Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium that can cause a range of infections, including persistent infections due to the formation of biofilms. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that form a protective layer, making them resistant to antibiotics and the immune system. In this study, researchers discovered a new structure in S. aureus biofilms that promotes their integrity. These fibers, made up of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs), have amyloid-like properties and consist of ordered aggregates of PSMs. Mutants unable to produce PSMs were more susceptible to biofilm disassembly, suggesting that the aggregation of PSMs into fibers modulates their biological activity. This discovery could lead to new approaches in treating persistent biofilm-associated infections.Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile bacterium that can cause a wide range of infections, from minor skin conditions to life-threatening systemic infections. Persistent S. aureus infections often involve biofilms, which are complex communities of bacteria encased in a protective matrix. Biofilms are resistant to host immune responses and antibiotics, making them a significant challenge in treating bacterial infections.The composition of the biofilm matrix varies depending on the strain, physiological state, and nutrient availability. In this study, researchers discovered a new extracellular fibril structure in S. aureus biofilms grown in a non-standard rich media. These fibers share characteristics with functional bacterial amyloids, such as curli in Escherichia coli biofilms, TasA of Bacillus subtilis, and the Fap fimbriae in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers are composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). Mutants incapable of producing PSMs formed biofilms that were susceptible to disassembly by enzymatic degradation and mechanical stress. Previous work has shown that PSMs promote biofilm disassembly, exhibit antimicrobial activity, hinder host immune response, and are abundant virulence factors produced by community-associated MRSA strains.The genes encoding the core family of PSM peptides are highly conserved across S. aureus strains, with four expressed from the alpha (Î±psm1â4) operon, two from the beta (Î²psm1&2) operon, and the delta hemolysin (hld) encoded within the regulatory RNA, RNAIII. The significance of PSMs has only recently been investigated due to their small coding sequences, which have eluded detection by conventional gene annotation programs, and their poor annotation in public databases.The findings from this study suggest that PSMs can modulate biofilm disassembly using amyloid-like aggregation as a control point for their activity. This is the first report to identify and characterize extracellular fimbriae in the S. aureus biofilm, and this research could lead to new approaches in treating persistent biofilm-associated infections.Keywords: Staphylococcus aureus, biofilms, phenol soluble modulins, amyloid-like fibers, persistent infections.
Researchers have identified two distinct types of Type II Secretion Systems (T2SS) based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. The Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type T2SSs were further analyzed, revealing that they have different pilotins that mediate their transport and assembly into the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae was determined, demonstrating convergent evolution as it is functionally equivalent to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria, but structurally unrelated. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, enhancing the kinetics of secretin assembly. Homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio, as well as a few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS. This discovery provides insight into the diversity of T2SSs and the mechanisms by which they function in different bacterial species.Introduction:Bacteria have three main types of integral membrane proteins: Î²-barrel proteins, lipoproteins, and secretins. Secretins are integral proteins that form multimeric secretion channels in the outer membrane, such as the Type II Secretion Systems (T2SS) and Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS), Type IV fimbrae, and the filamentous phage extrusion machinery. The T2SS secretin is a multimeric protein in the outer membrane that docks onto a platform of inner membrane proteins, which energizes its function in the selection and secretion of one or a few substrate proteins across the outer membrane. The archetypal T2SS secretin is PulD from Klebsiella oxytoca, which has three domains: the N-domain that docks it to the inner membrane components of the T2SS, the secretin domain responsible for multimerization, and the S-domain which is critical for PulD to engage the targeting pathway that will deliver it to the outer membrane. The chaperone targeting PulD to the outer membrane is referred to as a pilotin, and in K. oxytoca, the pilotin is called PulS. Pilotins of the PulS-OutS family function by directly binding to a short segment within the S-domain of their appropriate secretin. However, recent characterization of the T2SS in enteropathogenic E. coli O127:H6 strains revealed its function in secreting the protein substrate SslE, which is found in very few strains of E. coli but a homologous protein AcfD is widely distributed in species of Vibrio. It was hypothesized that organisms like Vibrio cholerae use the T2SS to secrete both cholera toxin and SslE/AcfD. However, it was unclear how the T2SS secretin is assembled in the organisms that secrete SslE/AcfD.Researchers identified a protein called YacC in EPEC, which has only 21% sequence identity to the previously characterized E. coli protein EtpO but has the conserved features of the PulS-OutS family of proteins. However, YacC does not function as a pilotin to transport the GspD secretin to the outer membrane in EPEC. Instead, they found that a distinct lipoprotein AspS functions as the pilotin for GspD in EPEC. The crystal structure of AspS shows it to have no structural similarity whatsoever to the PulS-OutS family of proteins. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that AspS binds to an S-domain sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, with sequence analysis distinguishing the S-domains of the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type secretins. These findings reveal that distinct classes of T2SS secretins can be recognized: one represented by the Klebsiella PulD which make use of PulS-OutS pilotins, and one represented by the Vibrio EpsD/GspD that makes use of AspS pilotins. E. coli pathotypes that have acquired the Klebsiella-type secretin depend on PulS-OutS pilotins such as EtpO, whereas E. coli pathotypes that have acquired the Vibrio-type secretin depend on the AspS pilotin to assemble a functional T2SS.Keywords: bioc
Burkholderia pseudomallei, a mostly saprophytic bacterium, can cause the serious and difficult-to-manage disease melioidosis in humans. Despite proper diagnosis and prompt therapeutic interventions, mortality rates for melioidosis remain high, ranging from 20% in Northern Australia to over 40% in Thailand. Little is known about how B. pseudomallei infects, invades, and survives within its hosts, and even less is known about the role of critical nutrients such as iron in its pathogenesis. Previously, it was assumed that B. pseudomallei used common iron-acquisition systems, such as siderophores. However, a clinical isolate carrying a large chromosomal deletion missing the entire malleobactin gene cluster, which encodes the bacterium's major high-affinity siderophore, suggested that other iron-acquisition systems might contribute to virulence. In this study, researchers deleted the major siderophore malleobactin (mba) and pyochelin (pch) gene clusters in strain 1710b and found a residual siderophore activity unrelated to other known Burkholderia siderophores. They also found that Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, and that Hem cannot complement a Hmu deficiency. Prolonged incubation of a hmu hem mutant in hemoglobin-containing minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin, suggesting alternate pathways for utilization of these two host iron sources. Lactoferrin utilization was dependent on malleobactin but not pyochelin synthesis and/or uptake. A mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. These data suggest that B. pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth.
A study was conducted to investigate the effects of Schistosoma mansoni infection during pregnancy on the immune responsiveness of offspring when they are exposed to Schistosoma mansoni later in life. The study involved children in Uganda who were born to mothers who received either praziquantel or a placebo during pregnancy. The researchers examined the children at age five for Schistosoma mansoni infection and their immune responses to Schistosoma worm and egg antigens, as well as T cell expression of FoxP3. Of the 1343 children examined, 32 (2.4%) had Schistosoma mansoni infection at age five. There was no difference in infection prevalence between children of treated or untreated mothers. However, infected children had higher cytokine and antibody responses to Schistosoma antigens and higher FoxP3 expression. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had no effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to Schistosoma worm antigen, which were higher in offspring of women who received praziquantel during pregnancy. The study suggests that maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This could have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that can cause infections in the intestine and liver. In-utero sensitization to Schistosoma antigens can occur in up to 50% of offspring born to women with schistosomiasis during pregnancy. This sensitization can influence immune responses and morbidity later in life. The study aimed to explore the hypothesis that schistosomiasis and its treatment during pregnancy could influence the immune responses of children when they are exposed to Schistosoma mansoni. The researchers measured immune responses to Schistosoma worm and egg antigens and regulatory T-cells in children at age five. The study found that infected children had higher cytokine and antibody responses to Schistosoma antigens and higher FoxP3 expression. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had no effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to Schistosoma worm antigen, which were higher in offspring of women who received praziquantel during pregnancy. The study suggests that maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This could have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.Keywords: Schistosoma mansoni, pregnancy, immune response, offspring, praziquantel, cytokines, antibodies, FoxP3, immunoregulation, pathogenesis.
Hox proteins are a group of transcription factors that play crucial roles in controlling morphogenesis along the anterior-posterior axis of animals. They achieve this by regulating specific sets of target genes in a highly localized manner, sometimes even in a single cell. This high regulatory specificity is thought to be achieved through Hox proteins cooperating with other transcription factors to activate or repress their target genes in a context-specific manner in vivo. However, only a few of these factors have been identified. In this study, we analyzed the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) in the fruit fly and suggest that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. This finding suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements (HREs) could be responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets. Therefore, a large number of transcription factors are likely to be directly involved in Hox target gene regulation in vivo.Hox genes are expressed in broad and partially overlapping domains along the anterior-posterior axis and are required throughout development to control morphogenesis. Despite being active in a large number of cells, Hox proteins affect target gene expression in precisely defined sub-domains. For example, the regulation of a Hox target gene can be limited to a single cell. Additionally, some downstream genes can be activated and repressed by the same Hox protein depending on the tissue or developmental stage. This context dependency allows a single Hox protein to affect distinct sets of target genes in the same cells during development.The molecular mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal precision of Hox target gene regulation are poorly understood due to our limited knowledge of the design and function of Hox-dependent enhancers and promoters and their interaction with the regulatory environment. Only a few Hox regulated enhancers have been analyzed in detail, and the combinatorial activity of Hox proteins and diverse transcriptional regulators on small regulatory elements is thought to be responsible for the spatially and temporally restricted expression of Hox target genes in vivo.In this study, we focused on the regulation of the cell death gene rpr by the Hox protein Dfd in the fruit fly. We found that eight transcriptional regulators, with diverse roles in patterning or differentiation processes, cooperate with Dfd in the regulation of rpr. These regulators are recruited to a minimal rpr enhancer through specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences and act together with Dfd to regulate rpr expression in the appropriate spatio-temporal pattern. Our data support the idea that the combinatorial activity of Hox proteins and diverse transcriptional regulators on small regulatory elements is responsible for the spatially and temporally restricted expression of Hox target genes in vivo. Additionally, our data show that even small Hox-dependent enhancers are complex and integrate diverse regulatory inputs, which result in precise spatio-temporal expression of Hox target genes.Keywords: Hox proteins, transcription factors, morphogenesis, pattern formation, developmental molecular mechanisms, molecular development.
A new approach to understanding the antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment involves using time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometry data to model the functional activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase of the cell cycle and subsequent generations. This method, which includes a framework modeling environment, allows for the application of different types of modules in each phase and the testing of models at the appropriate complexity level. The method was tested using X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells and resulted in a comprehensive in silico rendering of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, providing quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. This approach offers new insights into the complex response of cancer cells to anticancer treatment.Introduction:Anticancer research requires the evaluation of antiproliferative activity of new treatment options in cancer cell populations. While molecular understanding of cancer has advanced, there is a need for a deeper comprehension of proliferation in treated samples. Current methods, such as scores based on treated/control ratios, do not capture the complexity of the phenomena in play, leaving several questions unanswered. Mathematical modeling is increasingly used to tackle biological complexity, and the proposed approach combines experimental data with a computational model to render the process of proliferation at the cell population level.Methods:The proposed method uses a computational model whose input parameters are simple descriptors of the functional activities of the main intracellular molecular controls of the cell cycle, and whose outputs can be directly fitted to data obtained by time-lapse live cell microscopy (TL) and DNA flow cytometry (FC). The two platforms provide complementary information, with FC focusing on cell distributions in G1, S, and G2M cell cycle phases, and TL on lineage trees following cells in subsequent generations.Results:The method was challenged with time-course measures taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy in X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells. The most suitable model of the treatment was built by combining modules with a rational strategy and fitting all data of different doses and platforms simultaneously. The final model provided the first in silico rendering of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, with separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations.Conclusion:The proposed approach offers new insights into the complex response of cancer cells to anticancer treatment, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dose-dependence of checkpoint activities and the balance between recycling and death over three cell generations after treatment. This method can be used for in silico experiments to evaluate the consequences of default or potentiation of specific checkpoints on the overall effect of treatment.Keywords: anticancer treatment, cell cycle, checkpoint activities, computational modeling, flow cytometry, live cell microscopy, proliferation, time-lapse imaging.
Bacteria acquire new DNA through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which increases genetic diversity and helps them adapt to new environments. However, the integration of foreign DNA into the regulatory networks of the bacterial cell can be challenging. The global regulator H-NS interacts with both core and HGT genes, but it selectively silences HGT DNA through the help of the Hha protein. The H-NS protein, which belongs to the family of bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins, responds to external stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature by binding to specific DNA sequences and forming a nucleoprotein complex that switches off transcription. This silencing is relieved when environmental conditions change. H-NS targets both core and HGT genes, but it requires Hha proteins to selectively silence HGT DNA. The H-NS system is unique to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have only been isolated from members of this family. The ability to selectively discriminate between core and HGT DNA may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent state, providing a competitive advantage for bacterial adaptation to new environments, including host colonization.
A vaccine against HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, has yet to be developed due to the virus's ability to evolve and the difficulty in eliciting neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) that can protect against various HIV-1 subtypes. Previous studies have shown that individuals who have been superinfected, or infected with multiple strains of HIV-1, develop a broader and more potent Nab response compared to those infected with a single strain. However, it is unclear if this broader response also impacts epitope specificity. In this study, researchers analyzed the Nab responses of 21 women in Kenya who were superinfected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D. The women's plasma samples were collected a median of 2.72 years after the superinfection. Previous studies of singly infected individuals have shown that the majority of their neutralizing activity can be attributed to four main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope: the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. The researchers focused on these targets and found that none of the 21 women's Nab responses were dominated by a single epitope. Additionally, computational analyses suggested that 20 of the 21 women's Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These findings support the idea that superinfection with diverse HIV-1 subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, which could provide support for vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs.
Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) have gained popularity for analyzing population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies. However, the various LMM methods and software packages can differ significantly in their implementation and performance. In this study, we compared the performance of several LMM approaches, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM, using a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families. We investigated the sensitivity of these methods to user-chosen options and their ability to control the overall genome-wide error rate. We found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches and high correlation with alternative approaches, except for transmission-based methods when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. Overall, LMM approaches performed well compared to competing approaches, but the choice of precise LMM implementation cannot be based on power or type I error considerations, but rather on factors such as speed and ease of use.
Researchers have long hypothesized that transient associations among neurons are the basis for memory and behavior, but it's unclear how these associations form and how they can be identified. In this study, scientists recorded local field potential (LFP) activity in the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures to investigate the occurrence of large-amplitude LFPs, which they call coherence potentials. These potentials, which can last up to hundreds of milliseconds, mark periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information across the cortex. Coherence potentials provide a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and allow for the identification of specific neuronal associations. This nonlinear behavior is similar to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.The researchers analyzed ongoing activity in the motor, premotor, and somatosensory regions of two monkeys and rat cortex, and found a sigmoidal relationship between the amplitude of a deflection in the spontaneous LFP and the occurrence of identical LFP waveforms and amplitudes at other sites with millisecond delays. This phenomenon, called all-or-none propagation, arises due to synaptic transmission. These findings suggest a tipping point in cortical network dynamics, where a small increase in the number of participating neurons can lead to widespread cascades of activity, similar to the spread of ideas and innovation in social networks.Overall, this study provides new insights into the nature of neuronal associations and the mechanisms underlying their formation. The findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of memory and behavior, as well as for developing new approaches to diagnose and treat neurological disorders.Keywords: neuroscience, behavioral neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, theoretical neuroscience.
Polarized growth in cells is essential for maintaining the proper structure and function of various tissues. This growth is achieved through the coordinated processes of exocytosis and endocytosis, which transport membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex and retrieve them before they diffuse away, respectively. While these two transport pathways have been considered separate events, new research suggests that they are directly coupled. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Rab GTPase Sec4p plays a crucial role in this coupling by binding to Las17/Bee1p (WASp) during actin patch assembly, which induces endocytosis. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, while the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays show that GTPÎ³S-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation, indicating that Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis. Activated Sec4p then promotes actin polymerization and triggers compensatory endocytosis, controlling surface expansion and kinetically refining cell polarization. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the coordination of exocytosis and endocytosis in cells.
Miltefosine, a drug originally developed for cancer treatment, has shown promising effects against Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis. In this study, researchers investigated how miltefosine affects the exposure of worm surface antigens in vitro. They found that miltefosine treatment led to the exposure of specific antigens on the surface of adult worms, as evidenced by strong immunofluorescence and western immunoblotting. Four proteins were identified through proteomic analysis, including fructose-1, 6 bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, and alkaline phosphatase. These antibodies also bound to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induced immune agglutination, suggesting a role in immune protection. This study reveals a novel mode of action for miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent and highlights the potential of these antigens as intervention targets and antibodies against them as potential tools to increase drug efficacy and prevent re-infection. Miltefosine's ability to expose cryptic antigens on the parasite surface may be an important factor in host immune responses and the development of resistance to re-infection.
Neurons have distinct molecular compositions and functional properties in their axons and dendrites, but the mechanisms that mediate the polarized targeting of neuronal proteins are not well understood. Myosin Va was recently shown to play a critical role in targeting transmembrane proteins to dendrites, but the role of myosin motors in axonal targeting is unknown. In this study, we found that Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. Engineered non-neuronal proteins that interact with Myosin VI become highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Disruption of Myosin VI function or expression leads to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myosin VI stimulates dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that underlies the localization of many axonal proteins. Furthermore, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon in mice in vivo, suggesting it could be a useful tool for probing circuit structure and function. Overall, our results indicate that myosins help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins.
The idea that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems has long been a topic of debate in ecology. However, recent research on ecologically-inspired networks has challenged this assumption, as it was found that large and complex systems may not necessarily be stable. In this study, we provide analytical results and simulations that show that the assumption of a feasible equilibrium, which is necessary for stability analysis, does not hold in species-rich systems. We also explore how changing interaction structure and intensity affects feasibility and stability. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture. Our results challenge the common belief that complexity leads to stability and highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of interactions in ecological systems.
Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that causes cholera in humans, is known to colonize both marine chitinous exoskeletons and the human gastrointestinal tract. The protein responsible for this dual attachment is called GlcNAc binding protein A (GbpA), but the molecular mechanism of its interaction with both chitin and mucin was unknown. Through structural studies, we have discovered that GbpA has an elongated four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A glycan screen revealed that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides. Truncation mutants of GbpA showed that domains 1 and 4 interact with chitin in vitro, while domain 1 is also crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Domains 2 and 3 bind to the V. cholerae surface. Mouse virulence assays showed that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization. These findings explain how GbpA provides structural and functional modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons.Vibrio cholerae is a bacterium that causes cholera in humans, with an average of over 100,000 reported cases per year and potentially many more unreported cases. It is known to survive in both aquatic environments and the human intestine, and its ability to adhere to various surfaces is crucial for its survival and virulence. In aquatic environments, attachment to plankton, crustacea, and algae provides nutrients and a competitive advantage. In the human intestine, attachment to the intestinal epithelium is necessary for colonization.GbpA, a protein secreted by the type 2 secretion system, is believed to mediate adhesion to both aquatic organisms and human intestinal cells. It binds to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-containing carbohydrates, such as chitin, and has been shown to bind to mucins. The importance of GbpA for bacterial colonization has been demonstrated for the O395 and N16961 Vibrio cholerae strains.To understand the molecular basis of GbpA's function as a colonization factor, we determined the three-dimensional structure of GbpA using a combination of X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering. We found that GbpA has an unusual, elongated four-domain fold, with two domains showing structural similarity to known chitin binding modules and the other two domains possessing distant structural homology to bacterial pili binding proteins. Truncation studies identified the domains responsible for mucin binding and virulence in a V. cholerae mouse infection model.Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of how V. cholerae colonizes different niches and explain how GbpA provides structural and functional modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons. These insights may have implications for the development of new antiviral drugs targeting the enzymatic activity of BGLF4, which is required for expression of late genes.Keywords: Vibrio cholerae, GlcNAc binding protein A (GbpA), chitin, mucin, bacterial attachment, colonization, structural biology, molecular biology, microbiology.
A study published in the journal PLOS Pathogens reveals that sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound found in cruciferous vegetables, blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages by activating the transcription regulator nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). SFN is known to mobilize Nrf2 to reprogram cellular gene expression, and this study is the first to show that it blocks HIV infection in macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. The researchers found that Nrf2 depletion using siRNA boosted HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN, suggesting that Nrf2 action is crucial for SFN's anti-viral activity. The study also found that SFN blocks HIV infection after entry but before the formation of 2-LTR circles, and that it does not induce the expression of cellular anti-viral proteins SAMHD1 and MX2. These findings suggest a novel way to trigger Nrf2-mediated inhibition of HIV infection.The study's findings have important implications for HIV research and could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating HIV infection. The researchers suggest that the anti-viral activity of SFN is likely mediated through Nrf2 after it is mobilized by SFN. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the role of Nrf2 in HIV infection and provides a foundation for further research into the mechanisms underlying this inhibition.The study was conducted using primary macrophages and PMA-differentiated promonocytic cell lines, and the researchers found that SFN blocks HIV infection in these cells but not in other cell lines. They also found that SFN treatment inhibits HIV infection after reverse transcription but before the formation of 2-LTR circles, suggesting that it acts at an early stage of the HIV infection process.The researchers note that while SFN has been shown to have health benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its effects on HIV infection and to determine the optimal dosing and delivery methods for therapeutic applications. They also suggest that future studies could explore the potential of other Nrf2 activators as anti-viral agents and investigate the underlying mechanisms of Nrf2-mediated inhibition of HIV infection.In summary, this study provides the first evidence that sulforaphane blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages by activating the transcription regulator Nrf2, and that this effect is crucial for SFN's anti-viral activity. The findings have important implications for HIV research and could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating HIV infection.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects around 120 million people and can lead to chronic conditions with no available treatment. Current drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, have limited efficacy and toxic side effects. In this study, researchers used a whole cell-based assay to screen a library of 2000 compounds against T. cruzi, identifying three potential new drugs: PCH1, NT1, and CX1. These drugs have different mechanisms of action, with CX1 showing strong trypanocidal activity, which is essential for treating the chronic stage of Chagas disease. The other two drugs, NT1 and PCH1, have trypanostatic and parasiticidal effects, respectively. These compounds also show activity against Leishmania major and L. amazonensis, related kinetoplastid species. The researchers further identified two new compounds, PCH6 and CX2, with even lower IC50 values than the current drugs. These findings provide new potential candidates for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
 In the field of systems biology, understanding the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control essential biological functions, such as cellular differentiation and cell cycle control, is crucial. Bistability, the coexistence of two stable equilibria in a dynamical system, is a key feature of many GRNs. However, determining the network topologies that can exhibit bistability is a challenge due to the vast number of possible GRNs. In this study, researchers used chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) to systematically survey over 40,000 simple GRNs consisting of two transcription factor (TF) genes and their associated proteins. They found that approximately 90% of these GRN models have reaction rate constants that lead to bistability. This discovery included several circuits that did not contain the TF cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems and could only be identified as bistable through a subnetwork-based analysis. The researchers identified eleven minimal bistable networks, which are bistable networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks. The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies suggests that switch-like behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not easily lost through network evolution. The researchers also applied CRNT to publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion. This study demonstrates the relevance of CRNT in identifying bistable networks in real biological systems and highlights its potential for simplifying the study of complex regulatory networks, understanding network evolution, and designing new synthetic biological circuits.
 In the absence of an adaptive immune response, filarial infections can still cause lymphatic dilatation and dysfunction in murine models. To understand how filarial parasites and their antigens influence lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) directly, researchers exposed human LECs to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected patient serum. The results showed that live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Serum from infected patients also induced increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. The differentiation of LECs into tube-like networks was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (TIMPs). Comparison of global gene expression in LECs exposed to live parasites versus unexposed LECs revealed that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development as well as junction adherence pathways, which decreased trans-endothelial transport as assessed by FITC-Dextran. These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis.
Xanthomonas bacteria use transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) to manipulate plant genes and support their virulence. TALEs have a unique DNA-binding domain made up of tandem repeats, each with repeat variable diresidues (RVDs) that determine target specificity. In this study, researchers propose a new approach, PrediTALE, for predicting TALE targets based on recent findings about TALE binding, including frame-shift binding and flexible strand orientation. PrediTALE can account for dependencies between adjacent RVD positions and uses parameters learned from quantitative data. The approach outperforms previous methods and predicts several novel putative virulence targets. However, some TALEs do not have predicted targets, which the researchers call "orphan TALEs." They suggest that incomplete gene annotations may be the cause and propose genome-wide scans for target boxes instead of promoterome-wide. Using PrediTALE, known targets can be recovered, and new targets can be detected independently of existing gene annotations.
Bacteria, as single-celled organisms, have the ability to adapt and explore new niches through the evolution of new gene networks. One example of this is the OmpR protein, which is identical between Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli but has undergone regulatory specialization, leading to different environmental triggers and largely divergent regulons. In S. Typhimurium, ompR expression is elevated by acid pH, while in E. coli, it is not. This difference is due to variations in the promoter regions of the ompR genes and the ability of OmpR to bind to DNA in a more relaxed state, which occurs in S. Typhimurium under acid stress. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium overlaps that of E. coli at only 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes, including virulence genes, that E. coli does not have. OmpR binds to its targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, allowing it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress. The lack of specificity in OmpR's DNA targets and its preference for relaxed DNA make it an effective regulator for bringing horizontally acquired genes into an established regulatory circuit encoded by the core genome. This regulatory flexibility allows bacteria to adapt and thrive in new environments.
Two-component signaling systems are essential for bacteria, Archaea, and plants to adapt to changing environments. These systems typically involve a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue in a receiver (REC) domain. However, some REC domains lack this phosphorylatable Asp residue, and it is unclear how many of these divergent REC domains exist, what their functional roles are, and how they are regulated in its absence. In this study, we compiled all deposited REC domains missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue, which we renamed as Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains. Our analysis reveals that ALRs are surprisingly common and are enriched for rare effector outputs. The available ALR atomic structures, combined with structural, biochemical, and genetic data of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. This study defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains.Two-component signaling systems are crucial for bacteria, Archaea, and plants to adapt to changing environments. These systems consist of a membrane-bound histidine kinase that senses an external stimulus and phosphorylates a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue within a cognate Receiver (REC) domain in the cytoplasm. REC domains adopt the flavodoxin fold, a common (Î±/Î²) 5 architecture with a central 5-parallel Î²-sheet. The typical REC active pocket structure consists of an 'acidic triad' that includes the phospho-accepting Asp residue at the end of the Î²3 strand and two other acidic amino acids within the Î²1-Î±1 loop, an 'invariant' lysine (Lys) residue at the end of the Î²5 strand, and a metal ion (usually Mg2+) that are coordinated through hydrogen bonding. Crystalline and solution structure comparisons of inactive (unphosphorylated) and active (phosphorylated) REC states have revealed a conserved signaling mechanism that centers around an equilibrium shift and reorientation of a threonine/serine (Thr/Ser) and tyrosine/phenylalanine (Tyr/Phe) pair toward the phosphorylated Asp residue, resulting in a repositioning of the quaternary structure through the Î±4-Î±5-Î±5 interface of the REC protein architecture. After these events, the C-terminal Effector Domain (ED), which is often a DNA-binding domain but can also take the form of many other output modules, is then freed of the physical restraint implemented by close contact with the REC domain to enable downstream signaling.However, a second class of more divergent REC domains has emerged, which typically lack one or more of the aforementioned standard 'invariant' features of the canonical variety, including loss of secondary structural features and key residues involved in coordination of the catalytic pocket. Some of these 'atypical' REC domains have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs that include binding small molecules such as antibiotics and Ser-Thr phosphorylation through bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases and their cognate PP2C phosphatases, which regulate crucial cell envelope-related functions and virulence in many microbes. A key feature of many atypical REC domains is the lack of conservation of the phosphorylatable Asp residue, indicating they are regulated by input signals other than histidine phosphorylation.Described examples of these non-canonical REC domains come from bacterial pathogens and environmental microorganisms, including RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae, AmiR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, RedZ from Streptomyces coelicolor, HP1043 from Helicobacter pylori, ChxR from Chlamydia trachomatis, FrzS from Myxococcus xanthus, KiaA from Synechococcus elongatus, and several have also been described in plants. As the
The bacterial replication process is driven by the DnaA protein, which cycles between the active ATP-bound form and the inactive ADP-bound form. It has been suggested that DnaA also controls the initiation frequency by accumulating to a certain threshold level. However, a recent study found that cells with a 50% increase in ATP-DnaA concentration did not show earlier initiation of replication. This suggests that while ATP-DnaA is the motor that drives initiation, other factors are required for the precise timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. The study also investigated the roles of datA-dependent DnaA inactivation (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA. Loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein, indicating that compromised cell cycle machines perform in a less robust manner. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex interplay between the DnaA protein and the cell cycle machinery.
A rat mutation called dmy, which causes severe myelin breakdown in the central nervous system after normal postnatal completion of myelination, was studied to investigate the maintenance of myelin. The mutation was found to be a G-to-A transition 177 bp downstream of exon 3 of the Mrs2 gene, which resulted in a novel splice acceptor site and functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA confirmed these findings. Mrs2 encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. Dmy/dmy rats have major mitochondrial deficits, including a markedly elevated lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, a 60% reduction in ATP, and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed that MRS2 was dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and was ultrastructurally observed in the inner membrane of mitochondria. These observations led to the conclusion that dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease and that the maintenance of myelin has a different mechanism from its initial production. The study also established that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, affecting 12 million people worldwide. The parasite can cause different clinical forms, with Leishmania amazonensis being a significant agent in Brazil, leading to localized or diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The immune response of the host plays a crucial role in determining the parasite's phenotype and virulence. In this study, we compared the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice to understand the effect of the host immune system on Leishmania proteins. Nude mice, which lack T cells, may resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. Among the 44 differentially expressed proteins, we identified those related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases, including known virulence factors such as OPB and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells may restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. Conversely, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice. Our study may help identify potential virulence factors and ways to regulate their expression.Introduction:Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases reported every year. The disease can manifest in different clinical forms, with Leishmania amazonensis being a significant agent in Brazil, leading to localized and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The immune response of the host plays a crucial role in determining the parasite's phenotype and virulence. The murine model has been widely used to study Leishmania infection, with the infection of mice by Leishmania major being the most commonly used model. However, the response to Leishmania infection in athymic nude mice, which lack T cells, has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of the host immune response on Leishmania proteins by comparing the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice.Background:Leishmaniasis is a complex disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania.

A retrospective study was conducted on 498 isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii in Thailand. The isolates were from clinical, environmental, and veterinary sources, with 68.9% being from males and 88.5% of C. neoformans and 37.5% of C. gattii strains being from HIV patients. The majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their sources. The study identified 20 sequence types using Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis, with Thailand having unique sequence types for both C. neoformans and C. gattii. Most C. gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, which is the less virulent Vancouver Island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.
 Scabies is a common but neglected infectious disease that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly in economically disadvantaged populations. Current treatments, such as topical agents and oral ivermectin, are insufficient and resistance is emerging. Moxidectin, a promising alternative, was tested in a porcine scabies model, and the results showed that a single oral dose of moxidectin was more effective than two doses of ivermectin. Moxidectin remained effective for a longer period, covering the entire mite life cycle, and had fewer side effects. These findings suggest that moxidectin could be an effective and long-lasting treatment for scabies.
Type III interferon (IFNÎ») plays a crucial role in host defense against viral pathogens in the respiratory tract, but its role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of IFNÎ» in the lung during bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that both bacteria induced significant production of IFNÎ» in the lung, and clearance of these bacteria from the lung was significantly increased in IL-28R null mice compared to controls. This improvement in bacterial clearance was associated with reduced lung pathology and a lower ratio of pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells, IFNÎ» inhibited miR-21 via STAT3, leading to upregulation of PDCD4, a protein known to promote inflammatory signaling. In vivo, 18 hours following infection with either pathogen, miR-21 was significantly reduced and PDCD4 was increased in the lungs of wild type compared to IL-28R null mice. Infection of PDCD4 null mice with USA300 resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production. These findings suggest that during bacterial pneumonia, IFNÎ» promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4.Introduction:Interferons (IFNs) are a family of proteins that play a crucial role in the immune response to viral and bacterial infections. They signal through distinct receptors and activate downstream signaling pathways, primarily through JAK/STAT signaling and the induction of IFN-dependent gene expression. Type I and type III IFNs are the two main types of IFNs, and they activate distinct downstream signaling pathways. While type I IFNs are ubiquitously expressed and signal through the IFNAR receptor, type III IFNs, including IL-28A/B and IL-29, signal through the more cell-specific receptor complex of IL-10R2 and IL-28R. Type III IFNs are primarily produced by respiratory epithelial cells in response to viral stimulation and are required for clearance of influenza from the airway.In this study, we examined the importance of type III IFNs in the innate immune response to two major airway pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using a mouse model. We found that IFNÎ» is induced in the course of bacterial airway infection and results in downregulation of the microRNA miR-21, sustained expression of PDCD4, and increased proinflammatory cytokine production. Mice lacking the IFNÎ» receptor, IL-28R, or PDCD4 had significantly improved clearance of both airway pathogens and less pulmonary pathology associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines.Keywords: interferon, IFNÎ», IL-28R, bacterial pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PDCD4, miR-21, inflammatory cytokines.
A neural network with a single layer using reward-modulated spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) can learn simple foraging tasks. In this study, we expanded the capabilities of neural networks by introducing multiple plastic layers. The network utilized both reward-modulated and non-reward-modulated STDP, as well as multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy. The addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing non-rewarded STDP created neurons that responded to specific combinations of inputs, allowing for basic classification of input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network was able to learn discrimination between rewarding and punishing patterns, even in the absence of labeled training data. Synaptic noise facilitated trial-and-error learning, helping to identify effective strategies for task solving. The study suggests that a spiking neuronal network with STDP possesses a critical set of properties necessary to solve complex foraging tasks involving pattern classification and decision making.Introduction:Neural networks inspired by the brain should be able to perform sophisticated information processing, as the brain is deeply multilayered and capable of learning and responding to a changing environment. The visual pathway, the most studied sensory pathway, involves multiple stages of processing, and the role of reward in learning is still a matter of debate. Spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) is a promising model of learning at the synaptic level, but it relies on dopamine modulation of synaptic tags created by STDP for reinforcement learning. While some studies have attempted to perform task learning using rewarded STDP, the net increase of synaptic strength across the network can lead to dysfunctional brain activity. To prevent runaway synaptic dynamics, various regulatory synaptic mechanisms maintain the distribution of synaptic weights in biological networks. This study builds a model containing two plastic layers inspired by mammalian brain pathways responsible for decision making, with the first layer using unsupervised learning to classify inputs and the second layer using rewarded STDP for decision making. The network simulates an agent moving through an unknown environment, continuously learning distinct input patterns of food and adjusting synaptic weights controlling its movement according to reward and punishment signals based on the shape of food particles it acquires. The multilayered network combining rewarded and non-rewarded STDP and synaptic regulatory mechanisms is capable of solving a more complex foraging task, involving discrimination between elementary patterns of food, than previously reported in networks with only one plastic layer based on rewarded STDP.Keywords: neural networks, learning, reward-modulated spike time dependent plasticity, synaptic plasticity, homeostatic regulation, foraging, pattern classification, decision making.
 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying disease susceptibility loci for complex diseases, but the question remains whether individual disease risk can be quantified based on genotype data for personalized prevention and treatment. Previous studies have used limited numbers of confirmed susceptibility loci and simple statistical approaches, resulting in poor performance. In this study, we propose that sophisticated machine-learning approaches using a large ensemble of markers may improve disease risk assessment. We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to a GWAS dataset for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and achieved an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.84 in both independent datasets. Our findings suggest that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers. We are optimistic that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays.
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic in 98 countries, with approximately 2 million cases and 20,000-40,000 deaths annually. Brazil is one of the most affected countries, with an estimated 350 million people at risk. In this study, we analyzed reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil from 2001 to 2010 using Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models. Our analysis identified precipitation and socioeconomic factors as important risk factors for both types of leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (SD: 7,676) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 (SD: 288) for visceral leishmaniasis. Our risk maps identified priority areas for disease control efforts, with the highest numbers of infected people predicted in the states of Minas Gerais and ParÃ¡ for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. These high-resolution incidence maps can help decision-makers target interventions to reduce disease incidence and optimize resource allocation for control and elimination efforts.
IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, a process essential for the development of blood cells. IKAROS works in collaboration with the NuRD complex, which can both repress and activate transcription. The mechanism by which IKAROS can support transcription activation while being associated with the HDAC-containing NuRD complex is not well understood. In this study, researchers have discovered that NuRD and the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) are assembled in a complex that can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1Î± (PP1Î±), an IKAROS-binding protein and P-TEFb activator, to CDK9. An IKAROS mutant that is unable to bind PP1Î± cannot sustain gene expression and impedes normal differentiation of IkNULL hematopoietic progenitors. Additionally, the knock-down of the NuRD subunit Mi2 reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and thereby, promotes transcription elongation. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the role of IKAROS and the NuRD-P-TEFb complex in the regulation of hematopoiesis.
Mitochondria, which originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts, have a complex protein import system to facilitate the transfer of proteins across their outer membrane. The initial import of most proteins is mediated by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM). While it is known that TOM is present in all forms of mitochondria, its structure and subunit composition vary between different eukaryotic lineages. In this study, researchers analyzed the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a type of anaerobic mitochondria found in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. They discovered that the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, named TvTOM, consists of a highly divergent Î²-barrel protein TvTom40-2, which forms a translocation channel for hydrogenosomal protein import. TvTOM also contains four tail-anchored proteins, including Tom36 and Tom46, which likely function as receptors, and Tom22-like protein, which lacks a trans domain. Additionally, they identified a new protein, Homp19, with no known homology. The researchers also found that TvTOM is associated with sorting and assembly machinery (Sam50) involved in Î²-barrel assembly. Overall, the findings suggest that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor, while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to discover new genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer in East-Asian women, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. The study analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, and identified 94 SNPs for replication in 5,203 additional subjects. The top SNP, rs9485372, located near the TGF-Î² activated kinase (TAB2) gene on chromosome 6q25.1, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages of the study, with a P-value of 3.8Ã10â12 in the combined analysis of all samples. Two other possible susceptibility loci were identified: rs9383951, located in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene, and rs7107217, located at 11q24.3. These findings provide strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus near the TAB2 gene and identify two potential susceptibility loci in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively. This study is important as it expands our understanding of the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility in East-Asian women, who have been underrepresented in previous studies.Breast cancer is a common malignancy diagnosed among women worldwide, including those in East Asian countries. While previous studies have identified some genetic risk factors for breast cancer, they explain less than 30% of the heritability for this cancer. Additionally, most previous GWAS were conducted in women of European ancestry, and many of the variants discovered in European populations did not show strong associations in other ethnic groups. Therefore, it is important to conduct GWAS in non-European women to fully understand the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility. In this study, a large GWAS was conducted in East-Asian women, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women, to identify new genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. The study analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, and identified 94 SNPs for replication in 5,203 additional subjects.

 Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are essential for understanding complex biological systems, but the large amounts of data generated by high-throughput techniques come with high levels of noise and incompleteness. In this study, we present a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks using a geometric graph model. Our approach achieves high specificity and sensitivity, and we apply it to the human PPI network to predict new interactions and validate them against existing databases. The data and code implementing the methods are freely available online.Protein interactions occur based on their biochemical properties, which can be considered as dimensions of an abstract metric space. PPI networks reside in some biochemical space with a finite number of dimensions. Geometric random graphs, a versatile graph family, are a good model for PPI networks due to their ability to capture various global and local network properties. We construct a geometric random graph using low-dimensional Euclidean space and the Euclidean distance norm, and we demonstrate that it can be used to assess the confidence levels of known interactions and predict new ones. Our approach outperforms existing PPI network post-processing techniques.The geometric random graph model matches PPI networks in terms of various properties, such as pathlengths, clustering coefficients, relative graphlet frequency distance, and graphlet degree distribution. We have also designed an algorithm to test directly whether PPI networks are geometric by embedding them into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Our results support the hypothesis that PPI networks are geometric, and this finding has implications for understanding their structure and function.Keywords: Protein-protein interaction networks, geometric graphs, confidence assessment, data validation, computational biology, systems biology.
 Buruli ulcer, a chronic skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is characterized by the production of the cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin mycolactone. While the immune response against this pathogen and the protective mechanisms are not fully understood, recent evidence suggests an early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. In an experimental mouse model, we found that interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) plays a crucial role in early host defense against M. ulcerans infections. IFN-Î³ knockout mice displayed faster progression of the infection, with more extensive tissue necrosis, edema formation, and a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that mice lacking IFN-Î³ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. These findings support the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be applicable to Buruli ulcer, as IFN-Î³ is critical for host defense against intracellular pathogens.
Aedes aegypti, the mosquito responsible for spreading diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, is a major target for vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional mosquito surveillance relies on household larval surveys, but new trapping devices offer more efficient and sensitive alternatives. In this study, we compared the performance of four types of traps - BG-Sentinel, Adultrap, MosquiTRAP, and ovitraps - to the traditional larval survey in five mid-sized cities with varying tropical climate regimens. Traps for adults (BG-Sentinel, Adultrap, and MosquiTRAP) or eggs (ovitraps) were used monthly in three 1 km2 areas per city. The House Index, which is the standard for assessing mosquito infestation risk, was consistently low in most cities, with a median of 0%. Traps were more sensitive than the larval survey in detecting mosquito presence, and all traps agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Temperature, rather than precipitation, was the primary driver of mosquito seasonality. All traps performed better than the House Index in measuring seasonal variation and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. The choice between traps should also consider differences in cost and ease-of-use.
Mean-field approximations are commonly used to study large neural networks, but they don't accurately describe the behavior of smaller networks composed of a few tens of neurons. In this study, researchers developed a new method to analyze the dynamics of arbitrarily small neural networks made up of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. They found that for strong inhibition, these networks exhibit complex dynamics due to the formation of multiple branching solutions, which is a finite-size effect that reveals differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. This spontaneous symmetry-breaking ability of mesoscopic networks is important as it helps regulate functional heterogeneity and reduce the impact of noise correlations on cortical information processing. The study provides a systematic analysis of the neural dynamics of small networks, which is crucial for understanding neural processing at the mesoscopic scale.
In the field of biology, understanding how complex tissue shapes arise through growth is a major challenge. Two theories suggest that tissue orientations are specified either through stresses (axiality-based system) or independently through molecular signalling (polarity-based system). While the axiality-based system has been explored through computational modeling, a new framework called the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework is presented in this study as an alternative polarity-based system.The GPT framework treats tissue as a continuous material, with regionally expressed factors under genetic control interacting and propagating. Polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and is anchored in regions called tissue polarity organizers, which are also under genetic control. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are then specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature.The GPT framework was applied to the growing Snapdragon flower as an example, and the underlying hypotheses were proposed to be tested through computational simulation. The study suggests that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth, a key feature of polarity-based systems, have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes.The GPT framework provides a valuable approach for understanding morphogenesis and may be useful for modeling animal systems where cell movement is limited. The software implementation, called GFtbox, is available at [www.uea.ac.uk/cmp/research/cmpbio/GFtbox. The accompanying papers provide a biologically relevant model of Snapdragon flower development, demonstrating how growth and polarity may interact combinatorially during morphogenesis.
Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg Anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of eyes (anophthalmia) and limb malformations, including post-axial oligosyndactyly. A genetic locus on chromosome 14q24.2 was identified through homozygosity mapping and subsequent targeted mutation analysis, which revealed homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 (Sparc-related modular calcium binding 1) gene. Four of these mutations were nonsense, two were frame-shift, and two were missense. The missense mutations were both in the second Thyroglobulin Type-1 (Tg1) domain of the protein. The gene-trap mutation of Smoc1 in mice resulted in a significant reduction of mRNA levels and led to hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly and eye malformations in homozygous mutant animals. SMOC-1 is a BMP antagonist and its loss of function during mammalian development may explain the limb and eye phenotype in humans and mice.
 In the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila, the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell survival, proliferation, and vein patterning. The genes spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr), which encode Zn-finger transcription factors regulated by the Dpp pathway, are essential for these processes. To identify the target genes of salm and salr, microarray experiments were conducted on salm/salr knockdown wing discs. The results revealed a complex transcription landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins, with genes whose expression is both turned off and turned on identified. Loss-of-function analysis of these genes suggests that a fraction of them are required for wing growth and patterning, providing new insights into the genetic control of wing development by the Dpp pathway.
In the field of neuroscience, understanding how sensory systems adapt to changes in their environment is crucial for efficient encoding of natural signals. In this study, researchers investigated the adaptation of a first-order auditory interneuron (AN2) in crickets, focusing on its response to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli. They found that adaptation shifts the stimulus-response curves towards higher stimulus intensities, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. This reduction in response for low-intensity sounds did not necessarily lead to an improvement in signal representation or an increase in encoded information. Instead, the results were compared with two competing hypotheses: infomax and selective coding. The infomax hypothesis predicts that the neural response curve should maximize the information transmission between the neural representation and the stimulus, while selective coding suggests that background signals should be selectively suppressed to enhance the representation of foreground signals. The researchers found that adaptation actually reduced the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals, and the response curve changes were not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of adaptation in the auditory system of crickets and challenges the traditional assumptions about the underlying principles of sensory encoding.Keywords: neuroscience, theoretical neuroscience, sensory systems, computational biology, computational neuroscience.
In the complex life cycle of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, the role of the RpoS regulon during the tick phase has not been well understood. In this study, researchers found that RpoS-dependent gene expression is crucial for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs. When RpoS is absent, the spirochetes transform into unusual round bodies in the midgut lumen during the later stages of the blood meal. This round body formation is reversible and appears to be due, in part, to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, which plays a role in glycolysis. The findings suggest that spirochetes switch to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation when the energetics for transmission are unfavorable.
Two-cysteine peroxiredoxins (mTXNPx) are ubiquitous enzymes that play various roles in cells, including peroxide removal. In Leishmania, which lack catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, mTXNPx was found to be essential for the parasite's survival in a murine model of infection. However, the avirulent phenotype of mtxnpxâ mutants was not due to the lack of peroxidase activity, but rather to a novel function as a molecular chaperone. This was evidenced by the enzyme's ability to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro and the increased sensitivity of mtxnpxâ to temperature shifts. These findings challenge the previous understanding of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins as only peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrate that they can impact pathogenicity independently of their peroxidase activity.
Plant polysaccharides are an essential part of the global carbon cycle and human nutrition, and their microbial degradation plays a crucial role in various industries. In this study, we present a new method to analyze how microbes, specifically the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans, degrade and metabolize different plant polysaccharides, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. We used a combination of carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening to study the bacterium's response to these polysaccharides. Our findings reveal that the bacterium prioritizes metabolism of preferred substrates and up-regulates specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. We identified 56 up-regulated CAZymes and tested their activities, which showed that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes from the same family but with divergent rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. We also tested these enzymes in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of microbial degradation and metabolism of plant biomass, which is essential for understanding carbon flow in the environment, promoting healthy human nutrition, and developing industrial processes based on cellulosic bioconversion.
Glanders, a bacterial disease caused by Burkholderia mallei, is a highly infectious zoonotic disease that can cause severe illness in animals and humans. Although eradicated from many Western countries, it has recently re-emerged in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. A recent outbreak of glanders in Bahrain was investigated using high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing of B. mallei isolated from infected horses and a camel. The results revealed that the samples from the Bahrain outbreak separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting the involvement of multiple B. mallei strains and a complex epidemiological background. The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations to each other may be indicative of a similar geographic origin. The recent emergence of glanders and worldwide horse trading may pose a new risk for human infections.
In the plant world, the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana has been extensively studied for its role in root development and auxin biosynthesis. However, it remains unclear how well observations from Arabidopsis apply to other plant species, such as Brachypodium distachyon. In Brachypodium, a gene called BdTAR2L, which is involved in tryptophan aminotransferase activity, has a hypomorphic allele (Bdtar2lhypo) that results in reduced activity. Surprisingly, this mutant displays elongated seminal roots, a phenomenon also observed in a stronger Bdtar2l allele and upon treatment with L-kynerunine, a specific TAA1/TAR inhibitor. Contrary to expectations, L-kynerunine-treated and Bdtar2l roots exhibit elevated auxin levels, not reduced. This is not due to compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways, but rather increased expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for auxin conversion from IPA to IAA. Ethylene, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner, is suggested to be responsible for the sub-optimal auxin levels that promote elongated roots in Brachypodium. This finding reveals a delicate balance of local auxin and ethylene activity in controlling cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggests an alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis.
3D organization of chromosomes plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long and densely packed polymers, and understanding their folding and dynamics is a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, which accurately accounts for polymer entanglement length and volumic density. This strategy captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system and allows for reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes. We apply this strategy to investigate the 3D organization of chromosome 3R in Drosophila during one cell cycle and show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions reproduces experimental data and predicts chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle. This approach offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and study long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics.
Toxoplasma is a parasitic organism that infects mammalian cells and replicates inside a parasitophorous vacuole that does not fuse with any host organelles. To acquire nutrients, Toxoplasma attracts host organelles, such as lipid droplets (LD), to the parasitic vacuole. In this study, researchers investigated the exploitation of host LD by Toxoplasma. They found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in cells with fewer LD or impaired lipid metabolism. The number of host LD and the expression of LD-associated genes progressively increase until the onset of parasite replication. Toxoplasma is able to access lipids stored in host LD and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and LD. The parasite also stimulates LD biogenesis in the host cell, leading to the accumulation of large LD inside the parasite. Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes host LD within the parasitic vacuole, surrounded by an intravacuolar network of membranes. Mutant parasites lacking this intravacuolar network display a diminished capacity to salvage lipids from host LD. The study highlights the importance of host LD for Toxoplasma's intracellular development and its ability to scavenge neutral lipids from host LD.
In the development of Drosophila embryos, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis. This process involves a balance between BMP and opposing EGF signaling. In this study, researchers used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ChIP-seq for the Mad and Brinker transcription factors to decipher the BMP-responsive transcriptional network during dorsal-ventral axis patterning. They identified multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. Manipulation of EGF signaling levels revealed that it negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription, indicating that the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property. The researchers also identified key roles for the Zelda and ZerknÃ¼llt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain and found widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. The findings were incorporated into a model for Mad-dependent activation and discussed in relation to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.The BMP signaling pathway is a conserved developmental process used to regulate various developmental processes, including dorsal-ventral axis patterning in embryos. In Drosophila, BMP signaling forms a gradient through the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Screw (Scw) ligands, which then activate the Tkv, Punt, and Saxophone receptor complex, leading to the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the Mothers Against Dpp (Mad) transcription factor. The Mad transcription factor then interacts with Medea (Medea) in the nucleus, leading to their stabilization and activation of target genes.The BMP signaling pathway is complexly regulated through phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination, which control its subcellular localization, transcriptional activity, and degradation. Mad and Med both activate and repress transcription. Smad-dependent activation can be attenuated by the Brinker (Brk) repressor, which is expressed in the neuroectoderm underlying the dorsal ectoderm.Despite progress in deciphering the Dorsal gene regulatory network during early patterning of the embryo, details relating to the transcription network underpinning dorsal ectoderm differentiation in response to Dpp are sparse. In this study, researchers investigated the transcriptional responses downstream of the major developmental BMP signaling pathway in the Drosophila embryo. Their data identified multiple target genes and enhancers and revealed that the EGF pathway activity is constrained in the embryo to facilitate correct Dpp-dependent patterning. They also showed roles for Zelda (Zld), ZerknÃ¼llt (Zen), and the BEAF-32 insulator protein in Dpp gradient interpretation.The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the complex regulation of the BMP signaling pathway and its role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development. The self-regulating property of the BMP gene network, as evidenced by the negative regulation of embryonic BMP-responsive transcription by EGF signaling, highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between different signaling pathways in development.Keywords: Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), Drosophila embryo, Dorsal-ventral axis patterning, Dpp-responsive transcriptional network, Mad and Brinker transcription factors, EGF signaling, Zelda, ZerknÃ¼llt, Insulator proteins, BEAF-32, self-regulating property, developmental biology.
Mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, contain both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear-encoded proteins. While mtDNA depletion is linked to various human diseases, little is known about how the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mt proteome) change under such dysfunctional states. In this study, researchers used network analysis of gene expression data to investigate the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted (Ï0) mitochondria. They discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks, with distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that Ï0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. The results demonstrate that mt protein composition changes to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. Understanding the human mt protein functional network provides a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.
Thioredoxin (Trx) is a protein that plays a crucial role in reducing disulfide bonds in other proteins. The mechanism by which Trx dissociates from its substrate, arsenate reductase (ArsC), is not well understood. In this study, researchers used a combination of theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical experiments to investigate the dissociation mechanism of the Trx-ArsC complex. They found that Cys32Trx, a cysteine residue in Trx, is activated as a thiolate and performs a nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx, the cysteine residue in ArsC. This reaction leads to the formation of the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide intermediate complex and the release of reduced ArsC and oxidized Trx. The researchers also calculated the pKa values of the cysteine residues involved in the reaction using the NPA-pKa correlation method, which is based on the relationship between the natural population analysis charge on the sulfur atom of thiols and their experimentally determined pKa values. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of thiol/disulfide exchange reactions and the role of specific residues in the reaction.Introduction:Thioredoxin (Trx) is a small, ubiquitous protein that plays a crucial role in reducing disulfide bonds in other proteins. It is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response, metabolism, and signal transduction [1]. Trx is a disulfide oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds in its substrates by transferring electrons from its active site cysteine residues to the substrate [2]. Trx is a highly conserved protein with a three-dimensional fold comprising a central core of four Î²-strands surrounded by three Î±-helices [3]. It features a conserved active-site loop containing two redox-active cysteine residues, Cys29 and Cys32 [4].The arsenate reductases (ArsC) from Bacillus subtilis (Bs_ArsC) and Staphylococcus aureus (Sa_ArsC) are well-documented endogenous substrates of Trx [5]. ArsC catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite and is a key enzyme involved in arsenic detoxification [6]. The reduction of arsenate involves a phosphatase-like nucleophilic displacement reaction in the active site and a distinct intra-molecular disulfide-bond cascade [7]. Three redox-active cysteines are involved: Cys10, Cys82, and Cys89 [8]. After a single catalytic arsenate reduction event, oxidized ArsC exposes a disulfide between Cys82 and Cys89 on a looped-out redox helix [9]. Thioredoxin converts oxidized ArsC back to its initial reduced state [1].The mechanism by which Trx dissociates from the oxidized ArsC to form the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide intermediate complex and release reduced ArsC and oxidized Trx is not well understood. The regioselectivity of the reaction, which is the selective formation of Cys29Trx-Cys89ArsC over Cys32Trx-Cys82ArsC during complex formation and Cys29Trx-Cys89ArsC over Cys32Trx-Cys89ArsC during complex dissociation, is a critical aspect of the reaction that is not well understood [10]. In this study, researchers used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the mechanism of Trx mixed disulfide dissociation.Methods:To study the mechanism of Trx mixed disulfide dissociation, researchers used theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants. They observed that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx, which is activated for its nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds. Cys32Trx is found to be more reactive than Cys82ArsC, and it directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Tr
Complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a crucial role in the immune response against mycobacteria, the bacteria that cause leprosy, by mediating the entrance of the bacteria into macrophages. In a case-control study, we investigated the role of CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels in Brazilian leprosy patients. We analyzed 213 leprosy patients (47% multibacillary) and 297 controls using multiplex PCR-SSP for polymorphism haplotyping, qPCR for mRNA levels, and ELISA for sCR1 levels. Individuals carrying the most common recombinant haplotype with rs3849266*T in intron 21 and rs3737002*T in exon 26, encoding p.1408Met of the York Yka+ antigen, showed a higher susceptibility to leprosy (OR = 2.43, p = 0.017). Paucibacillary patients with these variants presented lower sCR1 levels, reducing the anti-inflammatory response (p = 0.040 and p = 0.046, respectively). The most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form (OR = 3.04, p = 0.01) and presented the intronic rs12034383*G allele, which was associated with higher gene expression (p = 0.043), probably increasing internalization of the parasite. Additionally, there was an inverse correlation between sCR1 and mannose-binding lectin levels (R = -0.52, p = 0.007). Our findings suggest that CR1 polymorphisms regulate mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation.Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and M. lepromatosis, primarily affecting the skin and peripheral nervous system. It is a major public health issue in Brazil, with over 10,000 new cases reported annually. The disease's clinical spectrum ranges from paucibacillary tuberculoid to multibacillary lepromatous forms, depending on the quality of the immune response. Genetic variants of the host and environmental factors contribute to the disease's clinical diversity. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified polymorphisms in interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2), and human leukocyte antigensâantigen D related (HLA-DR) genes as associated with susceptibility to leprosy. Polymorphisms of genes associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, such as Parkin (PARK2), parkin coregulated (PACRG), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), also modulate susceptibility to leprosy in independent populations.The complement system, including 47 proteins and protein fragments, plays a crucial role in the immune response by activating, coordinating, and regulating a proinflammatory, proteolytic cascade. Altered expression and functional deficiency of complement components can modulate susceptibility to diseases, including leprosy. In leprosy, the entrance of mycobacteria into macrophages is mediated by complement receptors, such as CR1, which binds C3b/C4b complement fragments deposited on opsonized bacteria. CR1 is mainly expressed by erythrocytes, phagocytes, B and T cells, in membrane-bound or soluble form. It accelerates the decay of C3 and C5 convertases and serves as a cofactor in factor Iâmediated cleavage of C3b/C4b into ligands for other complement receptors. CR1 competes with MASPs for the same binding sites on collectins and ficolins, which initiate the lectin pathway of complement, and possibly acts as an opsonin, leading to CR1-mediated internalization of pathogens into phagocytes. In malaria, CR1 generates rosettes between Plasmodium falciparum infected and noninfected eryth
Metagenomic sequencing is a promising method for diagnosing human infections by capturing all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a sample. However, the accuracy of the diagnosis depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, but recent studies have shown that some of these genomes contain contamination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. To address this issue, researchers have developed a bioinformatics system to eliminate contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This system was applied to a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes, resulting in a "clean" database for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. This database provides better sensitivity and a significant reduction in false positives compared to using the original genomes.Introduction:Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a valuable tool for human pathogen discovery and diagnosis. Traditional methods for diagnosing human infections, such as histological, immunological, or molecular techniques, are limited and often yield incorrect or incomplete diagnoses. NGS provides a fast, specific, and relatively unbiased method of capturing the full spectrum of macro- and microorganisms in any sample. However, the dependence on reference databases for diagnosis presents challenges. No database contains the full spectrum of all potential human pathogens, and existing reference databases have been found to contain contamination.Eukaryotic pathogens, which include a diverse group of species that infect multiple areas in the body, are an underrepresented group in genomic databases. EuPathDB is a database representing more than 250 eukaryotic microorganisms, including both known pathogens and other closely related non-infectious eukaryotic species. However, most eukaryotic pathogens have not been completely sequenced, and the resource comprises primarily draft genomes at varying degrees of completeness.Recent studies have revealed contamination in public genome sequences of many organisms, particularly for draft genomes. Contamination and incompleteness in reference databases can cause bioinformatics analysis of sequencing reads to yield both false positive and false negative results, decreasing the overall reliability of NGS in pathogen diagnostics. False positives, where the wrong pathogen is identified, might in turn lead to inaccurate treatments, with the potential to harm rather than help patients.In this study, researchers present a new method for eliminating genomic contamination that can be used on both complete and draft reference genomes. They test their method on a large set of eukaryotic pathogen genomes, yielding a cleaned and filtered eukaryotic pathogen database ready for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those intended for NGS diagnostics, with decreased false positive and false negative rates.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify groups of functionally associated genes that play a role in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) by analyzing whole-genome expression profiles from multiple organs. The study used a two-way clustering approach, first defining tissue clusters based on mRNA signals within one organ and then clustering patients according to the mRNA signals within each tissue cluster. The study focused on organs central to energy metabolism, including liver, skeletal muscle, and fat deposits, as metabolic disturbances originating in these organs are believed to influence the progression and extent of coronary atherosclerosis. The analysis revealed a cluster of genes, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module), that was overrepresented in all three clusters and was genetically enriched with CAD risk. The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, and its expression was validated in three independent cohorts. The A-module, along with LDB2, merits further attention in CAD research.The STAGE study analyzed 278 global gene-expression profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues isolated during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using a two-way clustering approach. The first step defined tissue clusters based on mRNA signals within one organ, and the second step clustered patients according to the mRNA signals within each tissue cluster. The study's primary hypothesis was that there are groups of functionally associated genes important for CAD, and that these groups of genes act in isolation in each tissue or across several tissues. The analysis revealed a cluster of genes, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module), that was overrepresented in all three clusters and was genetically enriched with CAD risk. The A-module was also enriched with genes in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) pathway. The study validated the A-module in three independent cohorts and identified LDB2 as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, as supported by subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and the expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2âdeficient arterial wall. The A-module and LDB2 merit further attention in CAD research.Keywords: coronary artery disease, gene expression, molecular genetics, computational biology, atherosclerosis, LIM domain binding 2, transendothelial migration of leukocytes.
In this study, researchers investigated the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on human visual perception. They found that each perceptual report is influenced by two contrasting forces: sensory adaptation, which repels perception away from previous stimuli, and decisional traces, which attract perception towards the recent past. This finding is consistent with a Two-process model of serial dependence, where the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. The researchers propose a unified account of serial dependence, suggesting that functionally distinct mechanisms operate at different stages to promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.
In the natural world, animals have evolved similar traits despite having different ancestors, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. One such example is the elongated fins used for swimming, which have evolved independently in various aquatic animals across three different phyla. This study reveals that the optimal specific wavelength (OSW) for swimming with elongated fins is around twenty times the mean amplitude of undulations, a value that maximizes the force generated by the body and swimming speed. This finding suggests a mechanical basis for this optimality and provides evidence for the repeated emergence of convergent evolution in the animal kingdom. The OSW has been observed in a diverse range of animals, including cuttlefish, rays, skates, and various types of fish, and has been shown to improve swimming efficiency. The OSW is a significant finding in the field of biology, as it highlights the importance of physical principles in shaping the evolution of complex behaviors.
Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses that cause major human cancers, including cervical, head and neck cancers. Due to their association with cancer, there is a strong interest in developing new methods to prevent HPV infections, such as vaccines and microbicides. However, understanding the HPV infectious life cycle is necessary for developing effective microbicides. HPV infection is closely linked to the differentiation state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus only produced in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment. It has long been known that HPV must first establish its infection within the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but why this is the case has not been clear. In this study, researchers used chemical biology approaches to reveal that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. They found that the recipient cell must enter M phase (mitosis) for HPV infection to take place, and that G1, S, G2, and early M phase cell cycle inhibitors efficiently prevented infection. These findings provide one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia: only this compartment contains cells progressing through the cell cycle. These results also have important implications for HPV control, as defining a major condition for cell susceptibility to HPV infection may lead to new preventive and therapeutic strategies.Keywords: HPV, human papillomavirus, virology, host invasion and cell entry, viruses and cancer, antivirals, modes of action and resistance.
Orofacial clefts, including cleft lip and palate, are common birth defects with both genetic and environmental causes. While numerous studies have been conducted to understand the complex genetic etiology of this condition, the underlying factors remain incompletely understood. In this study, researchers identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene as a cause of syndromic orofacial clefting. HYAL2 encodes hyaluronidase 2, an enzyme that degrades extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. Transfection assays showed that these gene mutations destabilize the molecule, resulting in significantly reduced HYAL2 protein levels. Consistent with the clinical presentation in affected individuals, investigations of Hyal2-/- mice revealed craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, as well as incompletely penetrant features such as cor triatriatum sinister and hearing loss. These findings identify a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting in humans and mice and define the first molecular cause of human cor triatriatum sinister, highlighting the importance of HYAL2 and hyaluronan turnover for normal human and mouse development.Keywords: orofacial clefts, HYAL2 gene, hyaluronidase 2, hyaluronan, craniofacial development, cleft palate, cor triatriatum sinister, hearing loss.
Hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, during brain development can lead to chronic neurodevelopmental impairments, but the mechanisms behind this are not well understood. Recent research in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that hypoxia can cause axon pathfinding errors in certain interneurons and motor neurons. However, it is unclear if similar effects occur in a vertebrate nervous system. In this study, researchers investigated the effects of developmental hypoxia on zebrafish (Danio rerio) and found that it disrupts the pathfinding of forebrain neurons, leading to errors where commissural axons fail to cross the midline. These pathfinding defects are caused by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway and can be mimicked by chemical inducers or constitutively active hif1Î±. Blocking transcriptional activation by hif1Î± prevented the guidance errors. The researchers identified ephrinB2a as a target of hif1 pathway activation and found that knocking down ephrinB2a rescued the guidance errors. They also found that the receptor ephA4a is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons and that ephrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Magnesium sulfate, which is used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2a. These findings demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia and support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium.Keywords: developmental neuroscience, animal models, model organisms, genetics, neuroscience, genetics and genomics.
Filarial nematodes, which cause diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, have a mutualistic relationship with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia. This relationship is essential for the development, fertility, and viability of the nematodes, and depletion of Wolbachia has been proposed as a novel approach for treating filarial diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying this mutualistic relationship are not well understood. In this study, we used whole mount confocal microscopy to investigate the effects of Wolbachia depletion on nematode development. We found that Wolbachia depletion leads to extensive apoptosis in the adult germline and embryos, as well as in microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae (L4). Surprisingly, apoptosis occurs in the majority of embryonic cells that had not been infected with Wolbachia prior to antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, no apoptosis occurs in the hypodermal chords, which are populated with large numbers of Wolbachia. These findings suggest that the induction of apoptosis upon Wolbachia depletion is non-cell autonomous and may involve factors originating from Wolbachia in the hypodermal chords. The pattern of apoptosis correlates closely with the nematode tissues and processes initially perturbed following Wolbachia depletion, such as embryogenesis and long-term sterilization, which are sustained for several months until the premature death of the adult worms. Our observations provide a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.Keywords: filarial nematodes, Wolbachia, apoptosis, embryogenesis, sterilization, antibiotic therapy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, parasitic diseases, parasitology, parasite physiology, global health, neglected tropical diseases, infectious disease control, elephantiasis, infectious diseases, biology.
'Swine are proposed to act as a mixing vessel for generating reassortants of avian and mammalian influenza A viruses (IAVs) that could pose a risk to humans. However, the process of how a transmissible reassortant emerges in swine is not well understood. In a study, researchers analyzed 571 isolates from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues of co-housed pigs infected with avian H1N1 IAV and swine H3N2 IAV. They identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants, with the largest genomic diversity found in viruses recovered from lower respiratory tract tissues. Reassortants from lower respiratory tracts had the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells, and the cold temperature in swine nasal cells seemed to select the type of reassortant viruses shed by the pigs. One reassortant was identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tract tissues and was confirmed to be transmitted efficiently between pigs. The findings suggest that during mixed infections of avian and swine IAVs, genetic reassortments are likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract, and tissue tropism is an important factor selecting for a transmissible reassortant.'
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Cdc5, a polo-like kinase, plays a role in the DNA damage checkpoint response and in mitotic progression. When cells encounter persistent or irreparable DNA damage, they can adapt and escape the cell-cycle arrest imposed by the checkpoint. The mechanism of this adaptation is unknown, but it is thought that high levels of Cdc5 may modulate the ability of the checkpoint to inhibit downstream cell-cycle machinery. In this study, researchers overexpressed CDC5 in damaged cells and found that it had little effect on the early steps of checkpoint activation, such as the localization of checkpoint sensors to damage sites and the activation of Mec1. However, they did observe a reduction in Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the checkpoint through this mechanism. This finding is significant because polo-like kinases have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to activate downstream checkpoint kinases in other organisms, indicating that this function is conserved in vertebrates. Overall, this study provides insight into the role of Cdc5 in the DNA damage checkpoint and the mechanism by which cells adapt to DNA damage.Keywords: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc5, DNA damage checkpoint, Rad53, Mec1, polo-like kinase, cell cycle, adaptation.
This study combines neurophysiological modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to understand the persistent alternations in auditory perception during minutes-long presentations of ABA-triplet tone sequences. Unlike previous models, this network model includes neuronal units with sensory feature-dependent inputs that mimic the pulsatile-like A1 responses to tones in the ABA-triplets, and embodies a neuronal computation for percept competition beyond primary auditory cortex. The model predicts that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept, a property that has been previously established in visual bistable paradigms. The study confirms this prediction through psychoacoustic experiments and uses the behavioral data to further refine the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. The work provides a platform for future extensions to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition.Introduction:Auditory scene analysis involves segregating a complex sound scene into individual objects or streams. A common stimulus used to study auditory streaming is the ABA-triplet tone sequence, which can be perceived as integrated or segregated. The perception of these sequences can switch between the two interpretations during minutes-long presentations, a phenomenon called the build-up of stream segregation. Previous studies have focused on the early phase of auditory streaming, reproducing some characteristic features of build-up or the van Noorden diagram. However, none of these models have addressed the persistent perceptual alternations following the build-up phase. This study focuses on accurately reproducing the dynamics of these alternations.The model is motivated by physiological studies of auditory streaming and general models of perceptual bistability. It features a tonotopic organization with three units that receive input from A1, two peripheral units receiving input from regions of A1 centered at locations with best frequencies A or B, and a third unit receiving input from tonotopically intermediate A1 locations. The perceptual interpretations are classified through criteria on the firing patterns. The model incorporates a dynamical systems framework with firing rate-based neuronal competition mediated by mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise. The inclusion of recurrent NMDA-like excitation allows for some neuronal memory that links each tone and each triplet to the next. The model is developed concurrently with the design and execution of the experiments, allowing for a deeper understanding as one discipline feeds into and informs the other.The study compares the model's predictions with the experimental findings, using the dominance duration distributions from the experiments to constrain model parameters. The results demonstrate that the model accurately captures the persistent perceptual alternations following the build-up phase and provides a platform for future extensions to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition.Keywords: auditory streaming, neuromechanistic modeling, psychoacoustic experiments, perceptual bistability, tonotopic organization, neuronal competition, recurrent excitation, A1 responses.
Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are two mosquito species that spread diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, and Zika virus. To control their populations, researchers have been exploring male-based sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT), which involve releasing sterilized males into the wild to prevent them from mating with females and producing offspring. However, there is a need for a rapid and economical method to assess the competitiveness of sterilized males in the field. Previous studies have shown that rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, can be used to mark the body tissue and seminal fluid of insects. In this study, researchers investigated the use of rhodamine B to mark male Ae. aegypti for assessing their competitiveness during field releases.Males were marked by feeding on 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, or 0.8% rhodamine B in 50% honey solutions during free flight. All concentrations produced over 95% transfer to females and successful body marking after 4 days. The longest-lasting body marking was observed with 0.4% and 0.8% solutions. Rhodamine B marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness, and proof-of-principle field releases demonstrated successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females and recapture of marked males.Rhodamine B marking is a promising evaluation method for male-based SIT/IIT control strategies and a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments. It is less expensive, less time-consuming, and less invasive than traditional marking methods, making it a valuable tool for assessing the efficacy of SIT/IIT programs and enabling real-time adjustments.
'Ticks and mosquitoes, as hematophagous organisms, have evolved various strategies to evade the host's hemostatic system during feeding. One such strategy involves the expression of enzyme inhibitors targeting proteolytic reactions of the coagulation and complement cascades. While most inhibitors have been identified in the salivary glands, a few have been found in the midgut. Among these, Boophilin is a multifunctional inhibitor expressed in the midgut of the tick Rhipicephalus microplus, which targets thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. However, the mechanism of Boophilin's interaction with these enzymes, its effect on platelet function, and its role in inhibiting thrombosis in vivo are not well understood. In this study, we have purified Boophilin from HEK293 cells and characterized its interaction with thrombin, FXIa, and kallikrein using amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments. Our results demonstrate that Boophilin behaves as a non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin and FXIa, preventing FIX activation. It also inhibits kallikrein activity and the reciprocal activation, indicating that it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore, Boophilin abrogates cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Finally, Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion in vivo triggered by FeCl3 and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method. By inhibiting several enzymes involved in proteolytic cascades and cell activation, Boophilin plays a major role in maintaining a low hemostatic and inflammatory tone in the midgut microenvironment, allowing successful digestion of a blood meal which is critical for tick metabolism and egg development. Boophilin is the first tick midgut FXIa anticoagulant also found to inhibit thrombosis.'
In mammals, the sex chromosomes, X and Y, carry different sets of genes, and dosage compensation is achieved by doubling the expression of X-linked genes in both sexes, along with X inactivation in females. The mechanisms controlling X up-regulation are not well understood, but it is believed that they may involve both DNA sequence-based and epigenetic factors. To investigate how X expression is influenced by ploidy, researchers compared X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells, which have three sets of chromosomes. The results showed that the average X:autosome expression ratio was approximately 1 in diploid cells but varied in triploid cells. In triploid cells with one active X chromosome, X-linked gene expression was lower than expected, while in cells with two active X chromosomes, it was higher. These findings suggest that X expression is not strictly adjusted to achieve a perfect balance and may contribute to the abnormal phenotypes associated with triploidy. The researchers also found that absolute autosomal expression levels were similar in triploid and diploid cells, indicating no apparent global effect on autosomal expression. The results support a model in which X-linked gene expression is doubled in triploid cells with two active X chromosomes but is further adjusted in cells with a single active X chromosome by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets. This mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose expression dosage in relation to autosomal expression is critical. Overall, these findings provide insights into the complex regulation of X chromosome expression and its relationship to ploidy.
Candida albicans, a common fungus found in the human body, can switch from a harmless commensal to a pathogenic form, causing various infections. The switch from commensalism to pathogenicity involves morphological and transcriptional adaptation. Previous studies have identified several factors involved in this transformation, but it is unclear how they are regulated to coordinate the switch. A recent study has identified the Fkh2 transcription factor as a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, playing a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. The phosphorylation of Fkh2 is crucial for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. The findings provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity by identifying a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event.
Herpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV), are enveloped viruses that use the host secretory pathway for egress. To better understand the mechanisms behind PRV egress, researchers developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a pH-sensitive probe to visualize the precise moment and location of particle exocytosis. They found that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles, and key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway, such as Rab GTPases Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a, are present on the virus secretory vesicle. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport to the site of exocytosis, which is most frequently near patches of LL5Î², a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. Vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exocytosis for several seconds, and membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. By combining their data with recent reports in the cell biological and alpha herpesvirus literature, the researchers propose an integrated model of the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress.Keywords: herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, PRV, egress, secretory pathway, exocytosis, TIRF microscopy, Rab GTPases, LL5Î², viral particles, plasma membrane, intracellular transport, exocytosis sites.
 Influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes, continue to pose a significant threat to public health. The emergence of new variants with distinct antigenic properties can cause varying degrees of morbidity and mortality. Accurately estimating the mortality burden of new influenza strains is crucial for effective response and prevention strategies. In this study, we propose a novel model to establish a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by influenza strains and their antigenic distances to previous strains for each subtype of seasonal influenza viruses. This relationship can be used to rapidly assess the mortality burden of influenza A(H1N1) viruses by predicting the antigenic distance between strains based on their hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. This method could help health authorities develop cost-effective control and intervention strategies for influenza outbreaks.Currently, influenza mortality burden is assessed through case fatality ratios and excess mortality data, but accurate prediction of mortality burden during the early stages of infection is challenging due to limited and biased morbidity and mortality data. It is generally assumed that the antigenic variations of influenza viruses determine their intensity of infection and mortality burden. However, no study has yet established a direct correlation between antigenic variations and mortality burden. In this study, we used excess all-cause mortality data and viral data from the USA to establish a positive correlation between antigenic variation and total excess mortality caused by influenza viruses. This relationship can be used to predict the mortality burden of influenza A(H1N1) viruses by estimating the antigenic distance between strains based on their HA sequences. Rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden for new seasonal strains is essential for effective public health response and prevention strategies.
Leishmania parasites are protozoans that cause various diseases in humans and animals. They exist in two forms: elongated, flagellated promastigotes in insect vectors and round-shaped amastigotes inside phagolysosome-like Parasitophorous Vacuoles (PVs) of infected mammalian cells. In this study, researchers investigated if PVs of different Leishmania species could fuse with each other. They found that L. amazonensis amastigotes in large PVs did not fuse with L. major amastigotes or promastigotes. However, L. major promastigotes could enter and multiply in pre-existing L. amazonensis PVs. In contrast, L. major amastigotes did not enter L. amazonensis PVs. These findings suggest that PVs have unique characteristics that determine their ability to fuse with PVs of different Leishmania species. The mechanisms underlying this specificity remain unknown and require further investigation. Understanding the interactions between PVs of different Leishmania species could provide valuable insights into the biology of these parasites and their host-parasite interactions.
 In this study, we investigated the role of insulin signaling in the growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production of adult schistosomes, specifically focusing on the insulin receptors (SjIRs) of Schistosoma japonicum. We previously cloned and partially characterized SjIR1 and SjIR2, and now report that human insulin can bind the L1 subdomain (insulin binding domain) of recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2 (designated SjLD1 and SjLD2). We then used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro and observed a reduction in transcription of not only SjIRs but also other important downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. Additionally, we found that SjIR-knockdown worms had a significant decrease in glucose uptake compared to luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, we found that rSjLD1 and rSjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These findings re-emphasize the potential of SjIRs as veterinary transmission blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines.
Primate lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, rely on a protein called Nef for sustained replication and progression to AIDS. While Nef is known to enhance virion infectivity and downregulate CD4, its role in increasing the infectivity of cell-free virions is less understood. In this study, researchers investigated the functional link between Nef and the Env protein, as they could not detect an effect of Nef on the quantity of virion-associated Env. Instead, they looked for qualitative changes by examining how Nef affects HIV-1 sensitivity to agents targeting distinct features of Env. Nef conferred resistance to two potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs), 2F5 and 4E10, which target the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of TMgp41. However, Nef had no effect on HIV-1 neutralization by MPER-specific nAb Z13e1, peptide inhibitor T20, or a panel of nAbs and other reagents targeting gp120. This resistance to neutralization by 2F5 and 4E10 was observed with Nef from a diverse range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. Functional analysis of a panel of Nef mutants revealed that this activity requires Nef myristoylation but is genetically separable from other Nef functions. Glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV substituted for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. These findings demonstrate that Nef protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies, with important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
In the process of creating messenger RNA (mRNA) using DNA as a template, the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme plays a crucial role. The mRNA synthesis involves the separation of the DNA strands, with one strand acting as a template for the new mRNA and the other, non-template DNA strand, remaining unpaired in the transcription bubble. The exact route through which the nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) reach the active site of Pol II to be incorporated into the mRNA is still a topic of debate. Two possible entry routes have been proposed: the secondary channel and the main channel.Crystallographic structures of Pol II have provided valuable insights into the structural basis of transcription, but the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the full transcription bubble (TB) remains unknown. Understanding the structure of the full TB is essential for a complete understanding of Pol II transcription.In this study, researchers built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble using multiple sources of existing structural data and employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and structural analysis to shed light on NTP entry pathways. Their findings suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription.The researchers found that both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, but the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice as high as that of the main channel. They also discovered that the diffusion of NTP through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand.These results support the idea that the secondary channel is the primary route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription. This understanding could lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of transcription and potentially inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to transcriptional regulation.
In this study, researchers investigated how contextual bars influence the perception of a target bar in visual object recognition. Participants were asked to determine if a target bar was present at the center of a display, despite weak or missing contrast at the target location. The results showed that participants were more likely to perceive a target when the context had weaker contrast and could perceptually group well with the target. Conversely, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of their grouping with the target, biased participants to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounted for the data, suggesting that context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief about the presence of a target based on visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The findings suggest that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences.
Lectin-like bacteriotoxic proteins, found in certain plant-associated bacteria, have the ability to selectively kill closely related species, including phytopathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas. The crystal structure of LlpABW, the prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, reveals a structure consisting of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal Î²-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain adopts a fold similar to plant lectins and contains a mannose-binding site, while the N-terminal MMBL domain shares the same fold but lacks a functional mannose-binding site. The N-domain determines target specificity, suggesting that this bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity.
Bacteria exhibit a wide range of genomic GC-content, from less than 20% to over 70%. The cause of this variation has long been debated, with some suggesting it is due to differences in mutation patterns. In this study, we analyzed synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species and found a large excess of GCâAT mutations over ATâGC mutations in all but the most AT-rich bacteria. This pattern cannot be explained by mutation bias, as it would imply that most GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, which is unsustainable. The excess of GCâAT mutations is also not likely due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich. Therefore, we conclude that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species, and since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated to genomic GC-content, we further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
The expansion of certain types of repeated DNA sequences, known as trinucleotide repeats (TNRs), is the cause of several genetic diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). The instability of these repeats can lead to tissue-specific degeneration and disease progression. The mechanisms underlying TNR instability are complex and it is unclear whether chromatin structure and/or transcription contribute to this instability in vivo. In this study, researchers investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus using two transgenic mouse lines, R6/1 and R6/2, which both express a similar transgene but are integrated at different genomic sites. The researchers found that instability rates were higher in R6/2 tissues compared to R6/1 matched-samples, and that high transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility were correlated with increased CAG instability. However, the levels of transgene expression and specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues with very different CAG instability levels. Interestingly, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Additionally, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum. These results suggest that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability. Overall, this study provides important insights into the relationship between chromatin structure, transcription, and somatic CAG instability in vivo.
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that disproportionately affect low-income populations, and research efforts to address them have increased in recent decades. However, significant gaps in diagnostic and treatment tools remain. In this study, we analyzed bibliometric data from published research to identify and map NTD research networks in Germany and their international partners. We conducted a SCOPUS database search for articles with German author affiliations published between 2002 and 2012 for kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. We used open-access tools for data cleaning, geocoding, and creating co-author networks to analyze the collaborations and research institutions involved. Of the 26,833 publications addressing 11 diseases, we identified 1,187 with at least one German author affiliation. We extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. The majority of collaborators were from high-income countries and Brazil. Collaborations with partners in low- and middle-income countries were less frequent. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. We identified strong performers using classic parameters and social network analysis parameters. The research network characteristics varied between diseases. The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is less than half of its share in other fields of medical research. Our findings highlight the need to identify barriers and expand German research activities towards NTDs. Geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators and can facilitate data-driven health policies. Our findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.Keywords: Neglected Tropical Diseases, NTDs, bibliometric analysis, research networks, Germany, collaborations, social network analysis, co-authorship networks, research productivity, research capacity building, global health, public health policies.
 Chagas disease, the most common vector-borne disease in Latin America, is primarily spread by domiciled triatomine vectors, which have been effectively controlled through residual insecticide spraying and housing improvement. However, non-domiciled vectors, which infest houses through immigration from peridomestic and sylvatic habitats, pose a significant transmission risk. A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciled vectors inside houses and test the efficacy of control strategies. The model accurately predicted the field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was effective when applied yearly at 50 mg/m2 during the immigration season, but larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction in bug abundance. Insect screens, on the other hand, consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. The study suggests that insect screens offer an effective and sustainable alternative to insecticide spraying for controlling non-domiciled vectors, which is crucial for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
People's preferences, or "tastes," are not fixed, but rather can change based on new information and experiences. In this study, researchers hypothesized that people's tastes are uncertain beliefs and that they update these beliefs based on evidence, such as the preferences of others. The researchers tested this hypothesis by examining discounting preferences, which measure a person's patience, in a large community study of 14-24 year olds. They found that participants displayed decision variability, which was better explained by a random-taste model than a response-noise model. Additionally, apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model that took into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. These findings have implications for neuroscience, clinical, and developmental research.The researchers used the term "taste" to refer to the function that directly maps stimulus attributes to utility. They focused on epistemic preference change, which occurs when people learn about others' choices without explicit calculation of improved outcomes. The study builds on previous research showing that social influences can lead people to develop or repair maladaptive discounting, which is important in both economic and psychiatric contexts. The researchers tested their ideas using a substantial new sample of subjects and presented their basic discounting preferences and demographics. They found that subjects' uncertainty about their own taste for discounting is reflected in the variability of their choices, and that they shift their preferences more when learning about others' preferences. The degree of preference-shifting can be described in terms of relevance, which is the width of the distribution of preferences in a reference group. These effects dominate over more complex social motives, such as opposition or competition. Overall, the study provides evidence for Bayesian taste updating and has implications for understanding how social influences shape preferences in various domains.Keywords: social influence, learning, uncertainty, Bayesian updating, discounting, preferences, neuroscience, clinical, developmental research.
In the plant world, rice is a monocotyledonous crop that differs from the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis in many aspects, including the way ethylene and auxin interact to regulate root growth. While ethylene and auxin synergistically regulate root growth in Arabidopsis, their relationship in rice is not well understood. In this study, researchers discovered that ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. They found that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and the conversion of IPA to IAA is necessary for this process. The findings provide new insights into the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling primary root elongation, enhancing our understanding of ethylene signaling in rice.
The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 plays a role in regulating cellular proliferation, specifically during the cell cycle. In normal human diploid fibroblasts, MALAT1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 leads to activation of the tumor suppressor p53 and its target genes, and reduced expression of the oncogenic transcription factor B-MYB due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by regulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycleâregulated transcription factors. These findings provide insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation.MALAT1 is a long noncoding RNA that is upregulated in cancer tissues and is involved in several crucial functions, including acting as a scaffold, guiding proteins to specific chromatin sites, and influencing local chromatin architecture. It also regulates transcription and RNA processing events and serves as a precursor for small RNAs. MALAT1 is highly abundant in the nucleus and interacts with several pre-mRNA splicing factors, influencing alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Previous studies have shown that MALAT1 enhances cellular proliferation and tumor formation.In this study, the authors demonstrate that MALAT1 levels are regulated during normal cell cycle progression and that its depletion leads to cell cycle defects and activation of p53 and its target genes. They also find that MALAT1 depletion reduces the expression of B-MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. Overall, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation.Keywords: MALAT1, cell cycle, p53, B-MYB, pre-mRNA processing, transcription factors, oncology, biology, genetics, RNA, splicing, cancer.
HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, primarily spreads to women through vaginal intercourse. Semen, the fluid released during ejaculation, plays a crucial role in HIV transmission beyond just carrying the virus. Semen contains various cytokines, including interleukin-7 (IL-7), which is present in higher concentrations in semen of HIV-1-infected men. In this study, researchers investigated the impact of IL-7 on HIV-1 transmission in an ex vivo system using human cervico-vaginal tissue. They found that IL-7 significantly increased HIV-1 replication in both cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue. IL-7 prevented apoptosis in CD4+ T cells, as shown by a decrease in apoptotic marker APO2 and an increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells, as indicated by staining for the nuclear factor Ki-67. High levels of seminal IL-7 may contribute to the survival and expansion of the initial pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa during the early stages of infection.
In the field of evolutionary biology, the origins of genetic robustness - a system's ability to maintain its function despite genetic or environmental perturbations - are still a topic of debate. Three possible origins have been proposed: requirements imposed by varying environmental conditions, intrinsic factors such as metabolic needs, or adaptive selection in favor of robust genes. To better understand these origins, it is necessary to study the effects of each factor across many species and diverse conditions. In this study, we conducted the first large-scale computational analysis of metabolic networks from hundreds of bacterial species, examining their robustness across various simulated growth environments. Our findings suggest that variations in robustness reflect ecological adaptations, with at least 20% of non-essential reactions being environmentally dependent. This environmental-dependent robustness is associated with a species' lifestyle, with generalist species having a larger number of non-essential reactions. Additionally, we identified environmental-independent robustness, which is linked to a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities, such as fast growth rates or extensive production of secondary metabolites. By decoupling these two components, we were able to identify reactions that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets. Overall, our study provides insights into the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness and its relationship to metabolic networks.Keywords: evolutionary biology, microbial evolution and genomics, computational biology, metabolic networks, microbiology, microbial evolution and genomics.
Histones are essential proteins that help structure DNA in the nucleus of a cell. During DNA replication and repair, new histones are deposited onto the DNA to form nucleosomes. This process is facilitated by histone chaperones CAF-1 and Asf1, which work together with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to promote nucleosome formation. The Elongator complex, a six-subunit histone acetyltransferase, plays a crucial role in this process. The Elongator complex acetylates histones H3 and H4, and its catalytic subunit Elp3 interacts with PCNA both in vivo and in vitro. Cells lacking Elp3 exhibit loss of silencing at the chromosome VIIL telomere and HMR locus, increased sensitivity to DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and require Elp3 for S-phase progression in the presence of HU. The Elongator complex is essential for maintaining genome stability and transcriptional silencing, and its function is linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA.
Vaccines are an essential tool in preventing infectious diseases, and the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used, known as the inoculum dose, plays a crucial role in vaccine design. Higher doses can lead to better immune responses but may cause more severe side effects and reduce population coverage in the event of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal inoculum dose is a critical aspect of rational vaccine design. In this study, we demonstrate how mathematical models and experimental data can be combined to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines. We applied this approach to influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection in cotton rats at different inoculum doses. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can vary depending on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. This framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum dose.Vaccines come in various forms, including those based on non-replicating antigens and those containing live, attenuated pathogens. Deciding on the inoculum dose for a vaccine requires balancing conflicting goals. Higher doses generally lead to more immunity and better protection, while lower doses may reduce vaccine side effects and are necessary when vaccine shortages occur. The ability to predict how changes in inoculum dose impact immune protection and morbidity and to achieve the best balance between low doses to reduce costs and side effects and high doses to trigger a robust immune response is crucial for vaccine design.Currently, the main way to determine vaccine inoculum dose is through trial and error, which is expensive and logistically challenging. A more effective approach is to combine mathematical models with experimental data. This approach is commonly used in drug development, where pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models are used in conjunction with experimental data to optimize drug dosing regimens. In this study, we develop and analyze a quantitative modeling framework for live attenuated vaccines using data from IAV and HPIV infection experiments. We also explore a scenario for an inactivated vaccine.IAV remains a significant health concern, and while a vaccine is available, it needs to be reformulated regularly. Even when the vaccine is well-matched to the circulating strain, its efficacy is not as good as that of other vaccines, especially in the elderly. Developing a better vaccine that remains protective in the presence of antigenic drift and has a higher efficacy is a priority. HPIV is an important cause of lower respiratory tract illness in children, and there is currently no licensed vaccine available against it. Our study's main contribution is the development of a conceptual, quantitative framework that may be used to rationally design vaccines and determine an optimal inoculum dose for any pathogen.Keywords: vaccines, immunology, infectious diseases, influenza, parainfluenza, mathematical models, experimental data, inoculum dose, immune protection, morbidity, rational vaccine design.
A better understanding of the role of DNA methylation in cancer has long been a focus in cancer research. The enzyme Dnmt3a is crucial for establishing normal methylation patterns and mutations in this enzyme have been linked to leukemias. In a mouse model of lung cancer, the absence of Dnmt3a has been shown to promote tumor progression, suggesting that it may suppress tumor development by maintaining DNA methylation patterns. To further investigate this, researchers used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to analyze the methylomes of Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. Their findings revealed that Dnmt3a wildtype tumors had large hypomethylated domains, while Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Dnmt3a was found to be essential for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains, and Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. Overall, these results provide important insights into the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer.Keywords: cancer genetics, chromosome structure and function, genome sequencing, epigenetics, DNA, chromosome biology, comparative genomics, biology, DNA modification, molecular biology, nucleic acids, genetics, genomics, molecular cell biology.
A longer PR interval on an electrocardiogram, which reflects the time it takes for electrical signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles, is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias and mortality. PR interval duration is heritable and has been suggested to differ among different human populations. While genome-wide association studies (GWA) have identified common genetic determinants of PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, there is a lack of such studies in individuals of African ancestry. In this study, we performed GWA studies in 6,247 African Americans from four cohorts to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration. We identified a strong association with a variant in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) that explained 2% of the PR interval variability in African Americans and was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size. We also identified additional genome-wide significant associations with SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to PR interval in African Americans and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans. These findings may provide insights into molecular electrophysiology and lead to novel drug targets for arrhythmia treatment.Introduction:The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive test that provides a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart. The PR interval on the ECG reflects the time it takes for electrical signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles through the atrioventricular (AV) node. Impaired conduction through the atria and AV node is a central pathogenic mechanism in many cardiac arrhythmias. Prolongation of the PR interval is a risk factor for long-term atrial fibrillation, heart block, and all-cause mortality. A substantial proportion of the variability of the PR interval is explained by genetic factors, with heritability estimates ranging between 30 and 50% in populations of European and Asian ancestry. Identification of the specific alleles underlying the heritability of the PR interval may provide novel insights into molecular electrophysiology, lead to novel drug targets for arrhythmia treatment, and facilitate genetic prediction of arrhythmia risk and response to antiarrhythmics. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified nine loci associated with PR interval duration in populations of European and South Asian ancestry. However, there is a paucity of GWA studies performed in populations of African ancestry, and none have been performed specifically for PR interval duration, which has been suggested to be longer in individuals of African than European ancestry. Samples of African ancestry offer greater genetic diversity and shorter-range linkage disequilibrium (LD), which can facilitate narrowing of association signals. We studied the association of genetic ancestry with PR interval and performed a GWA study in 6,247 African Americans from four cohorts as part of the Candidate-gene Association Resource (CARe) consortium, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), the Cleveland Family Study (CFS), the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Replication of genome-wide significant associations was attempted in 2,022 African Americans from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC) and the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Study (HANDLS).
In the complex neural networks of the brain, inhibitory neurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons. Two common inhibitory network motifs have been identified: feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB). In the locust olfactory system, it was previously proposed that lateral horn interneurons (LHNs) provide feed-forward inhibition to Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing, which is essential for olfactory learning and memory. However, recent studies suggest that a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), is the primary source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and that inhibition from this cell is mediated by a feedback loop involving KCs and the GGN.To better understand the differences between FF and FB inhibition in circuit dynamics, we used a model of the locust olfactory system. Our findings revealed that both inhibitory motifs can maintain sparse KCs responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with in vivo data. These results suggest that the GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs.Understanding how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.
The BRCA Challenge is a project aimed at aggregating data on BRCA1 and BRCA2, two genes linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, to support collaborative research. The project, which is part of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), has created a website, www.brcaexchange.org, to provide a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number in the next-largest public database, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases and population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together experts from around the world to advance our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation, with ongoing work including data sharing, development of methods for extracting genetic variation at the individual laboratory report level, and engagement with patient communities. The goal is to create a comprehensive and accurate database to guide treatment decisions for patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.
A small GTPase called RAS is a common oncogene and plays a crucial role in transmitting proliferative signals in both normal and cancer cells through the RAF-MEK-MAPK module. Over the past two decades, researchers have identified a number of factors that regulate RAS/MAPK signaling, most of which control RAF activation. However, it is unclear if additional factors exist further downstream. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the elements linked to the RAS/MAPK cascade, researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells and identified 101 validated hits, including most previously known factors. Epistasis experiments revealed several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway, including a new protein complex that modulates RAF activation. Surprisingly, most hits were found to work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression, mainly consisting of constitutive splicing factors. Two representative members of this group were found to regulate mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Additionally, it indicates that core splicing components can impact alternative splicing.
Infectious disease outbreaks can be studied through the reconstruction of transmission trees using whole genome sequence data. However, the usefulness of this approach relies on the presence of genetic diversity on epidemiological timescales. The concept of "transmission divergence," or the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs, was introduced to quantify the genetic diversity expected from different pathogens. Through simulations using two transmission models and literature-derived parameters, it was found that transmission divergence is generally low for many major outbreak-causing pathogens, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. This low transmission divergence limits the ability to reconstruct individual transmission events using genetic data alone. Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as RNA viruses, provide valuable information on transmission events due to their high transmission divergence. Conversely, pathogens with lower transmission divergence, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information on individual transmission events. The results highlight the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.Keywords: infectious diseases, transmission trees, whole genome sequence data, genetic diversity, transmission divergence, pathogens, outbreak reconstruction, RNA viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, Clostridium difficile.
A study was conducted to investigate the relationship between pre-existing immune responses and the clinical outcome of dengue virus (DENV) infections. Blood samples were collected from Thai school-aged children before and after DENV infection. The immune cells, called peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), were stimulated in vitro with DENV and the secretion of 30 cytokines was measured. The results showed significant differences in cytokine production based on the type of DENV and the occurrence of clinical illness. Specifically, higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1 were observed in PBMC from children who later developed symptomatic DENV infection, while IL-6 was produced by PBMC from all subjects who subsequently developed symptomatic infection versus 59% of those with subclinical infection. Conversely, IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1Î±, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFÎ± were produced in lower amounts by PBMC from subjects with symptomatic infection. These findings suggest that pre-existing immune responses play a role in the clinical outcome of DENV infection and may be useful for evaluating immune responses to dengue vaccines.Introduction:Dengue virus (DENV) infections can result in a range of outcomes, from asymptomatic or subclinical infection to classical dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). While the majority of DENV infections are subclinical, those who develop DHF/DSS are often infants born to DENV-immune mothers or individuals experiencing a secondary DENV infection. Identifying the specific immunologic factors that contribute to dengue pathology or protection from disease has been a major challenge for researchers. Previous studies have focused on cytokines and chemokines in sera or PBMC obtained during or after secondary DENV infection. However, PBMC obtained prior to infection have not been available to determine whether pre-existing immune profiles could predict whether an individual developed subsequent subclinical infection or severe dengue. A unique cohort study in Thailand utilized active, school absence-based surveillance and routine blood samples were obtained before and after the peak DENV transmission season. This study design allowed for the detection of DENV seroconversions, or a four-fold or greater increase in anti-DENV antibody titer between pre- and post-season blood draws, in the presence or absence of overt, clinically relevant illness. In a previous study of this school-based cohort, memory T cell responses in pre-exposure PBMC were evaluated and higher frequencies of DENV-specific IFNÎ³- and IL-2-producing T cells were reported among schoolchildren who subsequently developed subclinical infection compared with those who developed symptomatic secondary DENV infection. The current study extended this analysis by stimulating pre-infection PBMC samples with live virus and evaluating cytokine profiles in cell supernatants using a multiplexed cytokine immunoassay.
