Neural networks in the brain are essential for complex cognitive functions, but it is unclear how immature neural networks develop into their mature form. Spindle bursts, a type of immature neural activity, are known to occur in the first postnatal week of rodent development and have been linked to critical brain development processes. However, the exact developmental trajectory of these bursts and their relationship to mature neural activity is unknown. In this study, researchers investigated the progression of neural activity patterns in immature mice using high-resolution in vivo electrophysiology. They found that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a transient quiescent period at the beginning of the second postnatal week. This period is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. This developmental trajectory is similar in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. The researchers hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is necessary for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. The findings provide insights into the development of neural network properties that facilitate information processing and cognitive functions.
A team of researchers have proposed that many decisions are made based on the accumulation of evidence until it reaches a threshold or bound. This theory, known as bounded evidence accumulation, has been used to explain how decisions are made in various fields, including perception and neuroscience. The theory predicts that an increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically, higher confidence. To test these predictions, the researchers introduced a novel sensory manipulation to mimic the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex in macaque monkeys. They found that increasing the noise led to faster decisions and greater confidence for both humans and monkeys, in agreement with the predictions of the bounded evidence accumulation model. The effects were consistent across a range of stimuli, where accuracy was minimally impaired. The findings provide evidence for the role of noise in decision-making and support the use of bounded evidence accumulation models to understand the underlying mechanisms of decision-making.
OCRL is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell physiology by controlling interactions at the cytosolic surface of membranes through its ability to dephosphorylate the inositol ring at the 5 position. Mutations in the OCRL gene lead to Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease, two X-linked disorders characterized by congenital cataracts, renal proximal tubule dysfunction, cognitive disabilities, and developmental delay. OCRL is expressed in all tissues and has a broad subcellular distribution, which is mediated by its interactions with proteins that control membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton. OCRL has been localized to the Golgi complex, various endosomal compartments, and clathrin-coated pits.OCRL's role at endocytic clathrin-coated pits is particularly intriguing, as these structures require PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane for nucleation and expansion. PI(4,5)P2 acts as a critical co-receptor for all clathrin adaptors and its levels impact the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits. Conversely, coat shedding (uncoating) after the endocytic reaction requires PI(4,5)P2 dephosphorylation.Previous studies have shown that OCRL has a role in preventing the accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 on post-endocytic membranes. However, it was unclear whether the absence of OCRL or defects in OCRL function impair clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, researchers found that the absence of OCRL in patient fibroblasts impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat, and such vesicles nucleate the actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. These findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis. Defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.
 In the development of tissues and organs, the distribution of signaling proteins is crucial for inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms of gradient formation remain unclear. In this study, researchers investigated the distribution of two signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, in Drosophila using genomic knock-in alleles. They found that FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal disc moves to the air-sac primordium (ASP) through FGFR-containing cytonemes, which extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes decreases with increasing distance from the source, creating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. FGF acts as a morphogen in the ASP, activating concentration-dependent gene expression, and inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels. These transcription factors antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. This reveals a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion.
This study used genome-wide data to analyze the genetic diversity and gene-flow in 48 sub-Saharan African populations. The results showed that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans due to recent population expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations have ancestry from outside of their current geographic region due to gene-flow within the last 4000 years. The study provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, which is relevant to genetic epidemiology. The findings suggest that admixture, or the mixing of genetically differentiated ancestral groups, is a common feature of human populations in Africa and around the world. The study refines previous models of African history and its impact on genetic diversity, particularly the movement of Eurasian ancestry back into the continent. The analysis also identified hunter-gatherer ancestry in non-hunter-gatherer populations, which is consistent with the known expansion of Bantu languages across Africa. Overall, the study provides a detailed picture of haplotype sharing across sub-Saharan Africa and the movement of alleles and haplotypes into and within the continent.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common human virus that can cause various types of cancer. EBV infects B cells, a type of white blood cell, and promotes their uncontrolled growth through the expression of viral oncogenes. One of these oncogenes, LMP1, activates a protein called NFκB, which helps the infected B cells survive. However, during the early stages of infection, B cells proliferate rapidly without LMP1 or NFκB, and do not undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. To understand how these early-infected B cells survive, researchers used a technique called BH3 profiling to study mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis. They found that the survival mechanisms of uninfected B cells, early-infected B cells, and immortalized cells differ significantly. Early-infected B cells transition from using the protein BCL-2 for survival to using BFL-1, and this change is unique to virus-infected cells. This transition is regulated by the viral EBNA3A protein, which plays a new role in suppressing apoptosis. This study provides important insights into how EBV evades the apoptotic response and contributes to the development of EBV-associated lymphomas.
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a crucial protein involved in the process of transcribing DNA into RNA. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII is a long, disordered region composed of repeating heptapeptide sequences. This region plays a critical role in the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and RNA processing. The CTD undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which help coordinate these processes.Recent research has identified two new modifications to the CTD of vertebrates: mono- and di-methylation of lysine-7 (K7) residues. These modifications, called K7me1 and K7me2, occur during the earliest stages of transcription and precede or accompany serine-5 and serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, acetylation of K7 (K7ac) is associated with RNAPII elongation, serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression.The balance between K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels. This discovery provides new insights into the complex interplay between different post-translational modifications of the RNAPII CTD and their roles in gene expression.Understanding the mechanisms underlying these modifications and their effects on gene expression could lead to new therapeutic approaches for diseases related to gene expression dysregulation.Keywords: RNA polymerase II, C-terminal domain, post-translational modifications, chromatin, RNA processing, gene expression.
Switches called Swi2/Snf2 ATPases play a crucial role in controlling various DNA-associated processes by remodeling substrates such as nucleosomes and transcription complexes. However, the mechanisms behind these ATP-dependent remodeling reactions are not well understood. Mot1, a single subunit remodeler, offers a useful system to study Swi2/Snf2 ATPases as it dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP) from DNA complexes. In this study, researchers have determined the crystal structure of Mot1's N-terminal domain in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). Their findings suggest that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA, potentially priming TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data indicate that Mot1's Swi2/Snf2 domain associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for understanding how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.Switches called Swi2/Snf2 ATPases are essential for controlling a wide range of DNA-associated processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcription initiation. These enzymes are best known for their roles in large chromatin remodeling complexes, such as SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80 remodelers. They are thought to track the minor groove of DNA, generating tension that induces transient or permanent alterations in molecular assemblies. Despite the importance of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases, detailed structural information about these enzymes bound to their substrate proteins and DNA is largely absent due to their complex and often multisubunit architecture.Mot1, a single subunit remodeler, is a useful model system for studying Swi2/Snf2 enzymes in vitro. It is conserved from protozoa to humans and was the first Swi2/Snf2 member for which the biochemical activity has been demonstrated in vitro. Mot1 dissociates TBP from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, directly regulating transcription initiation and global redistribution of TBP in the cell. Unlike most other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes, Mot1 does not require any associated subunit for its essential activity.The crystal structure of Mot1's N-terminal domain (Mot1NTD) in complex with TBP revealed that Mot1 consists of 16 HEAT repeats arranged in a horseshoe-like shape. A long loop between HEAT repeats 2 and 3, called the 'latch,' can bind to TBP's concave site and block TBP-DNA association. Previous analyses have shown that Mot1 functions as a TBP chaperone. However, it remained unclear how Mot1 directly impacts the TBP:DNA 'substrate' state prior to the remodeling reaction.To address this question, researchers crystallized E. cuniculi Mot1NTD in complex with TBP, NC2, and a TATA promoter DNA fragment. Their study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex.The data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data indicate that Mot1's Swi2/Snf2 domain associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for understanding how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.
Chromosome segregation during meiosis is a crucial process for producing haploid gametes. This complex process involves the coordination of multiple forces and regulatory mechanisms. In mammalian oocytes, a protein called Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) plays an essential role in this process. Sgol2 helps protect cohesin, which holds sister chromatids together, and promotes the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles. It also facilitates the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers) and limits bivalent stretching. Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, a protein phosphatase. However, its effects on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation are independent of PP2A and are mediated by the recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively. By linking many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation through its multiple interactions, Sgol2 is a key player in this complex process.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of invasive diseases in infants, particularly in low-income settings, spends most of its transmission cycle in the nasopharynx. Understanding the duration of this carriage phase is crucial for controlling transmission and predicting disease outbreaks. In a recent study, researchers used longitudinal swab data and whole genome sequences to estimate the heritability of carriage duration. They found that genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The genomic variation was further partitioned into lineage and locus effects, with serotype explaining 17%, drug-resistance 9%, and other significant locus effects 7% of the variation. The study also identified prophages as being associated with decreased carriage duration, independent of serotype, potentially by disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.Introduction:Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that causes diseases such as pneumonia, otitis media, and meningitis. The disease burden is highest in children, and for disease to occur, pneumococci must first colonize the nasopharynx and cross into a normally sterile site. The nasopharynx is a complex niche where each pneumococcal genotype must compete against host immune defense, other bacterial species, and other pneumococcal lineages to maintain its population. The average nasopharyngeal duration period is affected by a large number of factors, and understanding these factors is essential for controlling transmission and evaluating the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.The carriage duration by different serotypes is widely used in models of pneumococcal epidemiology, and variation in carriage duration has been linked with recombination rate, antibiotic resistance, and invasive potential. However, the overall and relative contributions of sequence variations to carriage rate have not been characterized. In this study, researchers aimed to determine the overall importance of the pathogen genotype in carriage duration and to identify and quantify the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration.Methods:The researchers combined epidemiological modeling of longitudinal swab data with genome-wide association study methods on the connected sequences to make heritability estimates for carriage duration. They further partitioned the heritability into contributions from lineage and locus effects to quantify the variation caused by each individual factor.Results:The study found that genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The genomic variation was further partitioned into lineage and locus effects, with serotype explaining 17%, drug-resistance 9%, and other significant locus effects 7% of the variation. The study also identified prophages as being associated with decreased carriage duration, independent of serotype, potentially by disrupting the competence mechanism.Conclusion:These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance and have important consequences for models of pneumococcal epidemiology and the evaluation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The study also highlights the importance of considering genomic variation beyond the resolution of serotype in understanding carriage duration and its relationship with antibiotic resistance and invasive potential.
C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has evolved independently in over 60 plant lineages, but the evolutionary pathways leading to this trait are not well understood. In a recent study, researchers used a combination of data analysis and modeling to explore the evolutionary history of C4 photosynthesis. They found that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was not a single, linear process, but rather a flexible one with multiple paths.The researchers analyzed data from 18 plant lineages that use C3, C4, or intermediate forms of photosynthesis, and identified four major trajectories of C4 evolution. They then developed a new Bayesian approach to model the evolution of the C4 phenotype, which allowed them to predict the order in which different traits evolved.The results showed that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was not driven solely by photosynthetic factors, but also by non-photosynthetic drivers. This flexibility in the evolutionary pathways likely contributed to the convergent evolution of C4 photosynthesis.Understanding the evolutionary history of C4 photosynthesis is important because it can inform efforts to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crops, which could increase their productivity in subtropical and tropical environments. The study's findings also highlight the importance of considering the complex interplay between different factors in the evolution of complex traits.
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common virus that causes respiratory illness in humans and animals. To ensure that the virus's genetic material is prioritized for translation, IAV uses a strategy called host shutoff to suppress the production of cellular proteins. In this study, researchers used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate how IAV achieves host shutoff. They found that IAV does not preferentially translate its own transcripts but instead reduces the overall pool of cellular mRNAs. Short transcripts, particularly those involved in cell maintenance processes like oxidative phosphorylation, are less affected by IAV. The researchers also discovered that continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest that the virus may prioritize the translation of essential housekeeping genes.Host shutoff is a common strategy used by viruses to suppress cellular protein synthesis and prioritize their own translation. IAV is known to induce host shutoff, but the mechanisms behind it are not well understood. Some viruses achieve host shutoff by co-opting the translation machinery, while others degrade host mRNAs. IAV was thought to use both strategies, but the extent and mechanisms of each were unclear.The researchers used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to study the changes in cellular gene expression and translation levels during IAV infection. They found that host shutoff is mainly achieved by a reduction in cellular mRNAs levels, and that IAV transcripts are not preferentially translated. They also noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins are less affected by IAV infection and their protein levels remain stable throughout infection. This continuous expression supports the energetic demands required for viral replication.The findings of this study advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of essential housekeeping genes. The researchers' systematic analysis also reveals that the extent of mRNAs reduction is related to their length and GC content. These insights provide new avenues for understanding the complex interplay between viruses and their hosts and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating influenza infections.Keywords: Influenza A virus, host shutoff, RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, oxidative phosphorylation.
Cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria that can perform photosynthesis, have a built-in biological clock called the circadian clock. This clock helps the bacteria align their biological activities with the daily changes in light and dark conditions. The clock is controlled by a protein called RpaA, which regulates the expression of genes involved in various metabolic pathways. In constant light conditions, the absence of RpaA does not affect the bacteria's ability to survive. However, when light and dark periods alternate, the absence of RpaA makes the bacteria unable to maintain an appropriate energy status during the night and unable to accumulate carbon reserves during the day. This leads to a defect in the transcription of genes crucial for utilizing carbohydrate stores at night. By reconstructing carbon utilization pathways and providing an external carbon source, researchers were able to restore energy charge and viability to the RpaA-deficient strain in light/dark cycling conditions. This study highlights the importance of the circadian output pathway in controlling and coordinating essential metabolic pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize the fitness of cyanobacteria under periodic energy limitations.
α-Helical coiled coils are well-studied protein structures, with their backbone structure being the most understood in molecular biology. These structures consist of at least two α-helices wound into superhelical bundles, held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. The periodicity of coiled coils can vary, but they are generally described by a heptad repeat pattern. Recent research has shown that inserting just two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil can cause the supercoil to strain and form short β-strands, resulting in a new type of fiber called an α/β coiled coil. This unexpected finding reveals that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold. This discovery could have implications for our understanding of protein structure and function.
Hemoglobin (Hb), a protein responsible for oxygen transport in the blood, has long been studied as a model protein to understand molecular adaptations in vertebrates. While it was believed that only the affinity of oxygen binding to Hb determines its molecular adaptations, a new study suggests that both affinity and cooperativity play important roles in optimizing tissue oxygen delivery. The researchers derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the 'biophysical Hill landscape' describing this relation. They found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape, allowing for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues. The findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb and have implications for understanding molecular adaptation in other proteins.
A new discovery from the world of insect biology reveals a functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. This unique feature, which includes two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals, allows females to obtain voluminous semen from multiple males during long copulation times in their nutrient-poor cave habitats. The semen is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as a source of nutrition. The valve complex enables females to compete for seminal gifts and potentially reverse the roles of the sexes, as the females have a penis-like intromittent organ. The switching valve is a morphological novelty that may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. The study of this intricate structure provides insights into the evolution of sexual selection and the development of complex biological mechanisms.
Previous studies have suggested the existence of a large pool of extrasynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) that are highly mobile and contribute to synaptic plasticity. However, the mechanisms underlying the entry and exit of AMPARs into and out of the post-synaptic densities (PSDs) have remained unclear. In this study, researchers used super-resolution microscopy to examine how the size and photostability of fluorescent probes attached to AMPARs affected their trafficking in and outside of PSDs in rat brain slices. They found that over 90% of AMPARs labeled with small fluorescent dyes or quantum dots (QDs) were confined to stable nanodomains within PSDs for at least 15 minutes. In contrast, over 90% of AMPARs labeled with large QDs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. Contrary to the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD 'slots', the findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. The researchers propose that the size and photostability of the fluorescent probes may affect the accessibility of AMPARs to the PSDs and the interactions between AMPARs and the surrounding membrane. Further studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying AMPAR trafficking and the role of nanodomains in synaptic plasticity.Introduction:Synapses, the specialized junctions between neurons, play a crucial role in transmitting electrical and chemical signals between neurons. The position and dynamics of ionotropic glutamate receptors, particularly AMPA receptors (AMPARs), are critical for synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity, the cellular basis of learning and memory. AMPARs are trafficked from their sites of synthesis to exocytosis sites near synapses, and their entry into and exit out of post-synaptic densities (PSDs) is a key aspect of their function. However, the mechanisms underlying AMPAR trafficking at synapses under constitutive conditions are still not well understood. In particular, it is unclear what limits AMPAR entry into and exit out of PSDs, and whether the recycling pathway under constitutive conditions is the same as that during synaptic plasticity.Previous studies have suggested that AMPARs are highly mobile outside of PSDs due to the limited availability of 'slots' in PSDs for AMPARs to bind. However, recent studies using advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques have challenged this hypothesis. In this study, researchers used super-resolution microscopy to examine how the size and photostability of fluorescent probes attached to AMPARs affected their trafficking in and outside of PSDs in rat brain slices.Methods:Organic fluorescent dyes, quantum dots (QDs) with diameters of approximately 4 nm, 10 nm, or over 20 nm, were coupled to AMPARs via different-sized linkers. The researchers used 3-dimensional super-resolution microscopy to analyze the diffusion constants, trajectories, distances from the center of PSDs, and changes that occurred over time after transfection. They also used 3-D super-resolution imaging of a PSD protein, Homer1c, to better resolve PSD dimensions.Results:The researchers found that over 90% of AMPARs labeled with organic fluorescent dyes or small QDs were found in PSDs, and less than 10% of these labeled AMPARs were highly mobile and extrasynaptic. However, when AMPARs were labeled with large QDs, virtually all AMPARs (90-95%) were highly mobile and extrasynaptic. The researchers concluded that mobile AMPARs enter PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously observed in studies using AMPARs labeled with large QDs. They also found that the size and photostability of the fluorescent probes may affect the accessibility of AMPARs to the PSDs and the interactions between AMPARs and the surrounding membrane.Conclusion:The findings from this study challenge the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD 'slots' and suggest that A
Histones are proteins that help structure our DNA, and the way they are modified plays a crucial role in gene expression. In the fruit fly Drosophila, there's a complex called DOMINO that is thought to both add a specific histone variant called H2A.V (H2Av) and acetylate histones. However, the mechanism by which this complex accomplishes both tasks was unknown. In this study, researchers discovered that DOMINO actually consists of two distinct complexes, DOM-A and DOM-B, each with unique functions. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, on the other hand, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex. This finding shows that different organisms can achieve similar functional outcomes through different evolutionary strategies, with Drosophila using alternative splicing to generate distinct complexes instead of gene duplication and paralog specification like yeast and humans.
Membrane nanodomains play a crucial role in regulating the behavior of Ras, a key signaling molecule, but the nature of these domains and their interaction with Ras has remained unclear. In a recent study, researchers used single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) to investigate the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D, an active mutant of KRas, in U2OS cells. They found that KRasG12D exhibits distinct membrane domains, with an immobile state in ~70 nm domains embedded in larger domains of ~200 nm that confer intermediate mobility. The protein is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels. These findings offer new insights into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling and reveal how membrane organization dictates the behavior of this important signaling molecule.
In recent years, there have been several reports suggesting that magnetic fields play a role in biological systems, from magnetosensation in animals to magnetically controlling membrane conductance in cells. However, these findings have been met with skepticism due to the large discrepancies between the reported phenomena and the known laws of physics. In this short report, I will argue that these claims conflict with fundamental physical principles and suggest alternative explanations.First, the idea of a protein complex acting like a compass needle to sense magnetic orientation in animals is intriguing, but the reported sensitivity is several orders of magnitude greater than what is physically possible for a protein complex of that size. Similarly, the reports of magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then manipulating it with a magnetic field also face significant challenges.The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes imposes serious limitations on their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The magnetic susceptibility of proteins is typically much lower than that of ferromagnetic materials, making it difficult to achieve the required magnetic fields and gradients.In conclusion, while the potential applications of magnetically controlling cells are exciting, it is crucial to ensure that any proposed mechanisms are consistent with the known laws of physics. The reported phenomena should be reevaluated in light of these considerations, and future hypotheses should be subjected to rigorous testing to avoid unrealistic expectations.Keywords: short report, physics of living systems, neuroscience.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a condition characterized by impaired pitch processing, have been shown to rely on other dimensions such as duration when processing speech. To understand the neural basis for this strategy, researchers conducted an fMRI study involving 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls. Participants were asked to match sentences with spoken versions that differed in pitch and/or duration cues. The results revealed reduced functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions in individuals with amusia. This connectivity difference was not present during a control task, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. The findings indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions.
Non-coding protein 4 (NCOA4) plays a crucial role in the autophagic turnover of ferritin, a process essential for regulating intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy flux and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are not well understood. In a recent study, researchers investigated the interaction between NCOA4 and ferritin to understand the molecular basis of ferritinophagy. They found that direct association between NCOA4 and ferritin, specifically through a key arginine residue in ferritin and a C-terminal element in NCOA4, is necessary for ferritin delivery to the lysosome via autophagosomes. Additionally, NCOA4 abundance is regulated by both autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. This research provides insights into the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and explains how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting.
ISG15 is a protein that plays a role in the immune response against viruses by modifying other proteins through a process called ISGylation. Its role during bacterial infections, however, is less understood. In this study, researchers found that ISG15 expression is significantly increased in nonphagocytic cells during Listeria infection, even without the involvement of type I interferon. Instead, this induction is dependent on the cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP), which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. Importantly, the researchers found that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. They identified several ISGylated proteins using stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC), which were primarily found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This enrichment correlated with an increase in the secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection. Overall, these findings reveal a previously uncharacterized role for ISG15 in the restriction of Listeria infection and reinforce its importance as a key component of the innate immune response.
The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is known for its ability to navigate using odor gradients. To understand how the early olfactory circuits process temporal variations of olfactory stimuli, researchers exposed flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and analyzed the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). They found that the PN output strongly signaled the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model that admits the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs accurately predicted the PN output. This suggests that PNs primarily signal the acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.The olfactory system is crucial for animals to detect and respond to temporal variations of odor stimuli, as odors in nature are intermittent and dynamic. Drosophila larvae and adult flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors, such as moving towards an attractive odor and staying within a specific odor zone. To process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers, it is essential to precisely measure the input stimuli and systematically explore the input space.In Drosophila, OSNs expressing the same receptors connect with PNs in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments, called olfactory glomeruli, in the antennal lobe. PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn. Recent studies have shown that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time. Building on this, the researchers analyzed the correlation structure of input/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway and constructed a two-dimensional linear-nonlinear (LN) model of the OSN-to-PN transformation by inducing an ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates via a systematic design of olfactory stimuli.The findings from this study provide insights into how PNs contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments and enable animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations. Further research is needed to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the encoding and processing of temporal information in the olfactory system.
