 The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma disease compared to mass drug administration (MDA) in four endemic populations in West and East Africa. The study used a mathematical model of transmission to compare the two approaches and found that targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma was as effective as MDA and more cost-effective when antibiotics were not donated. The study also found that targeting antibiotics to children alone was not as effective as targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma. The study recommends that targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma should be considered as an alternative to MDA in certain settings.
 This study provides a unique outlook at the complex interplay between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses during host evolution . We characterized the evolutionary history and molecular virology of 27 enJSRV proviruses in the sheep genome. These enJSRVs have been integrating in the host genome for the last 5–7 million y , and two of them ( enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20 ) , which entered the host genome within the last 3 million y ( before and around sheep domestication [ ∼ 9 , 000 y ago ] ) , acquired a defective Gag polyprotein resulting in a transdominant phenotype able to block late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses . Both transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication ( ∼ 9 , 000 y ago ) . Interestingly , a provirus escaping the transdominant enJSRVs has emerged very recently , most likely within the last 200 y . Thus , we determined sequentially distinct events during evolution that are indicative of an evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses . These data strongly suggest that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections .
 The Drosophila embryonic gonad is assembled from two distinct cell types , the Primordial Germ Cells ( PGCs ) and the Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells ( SGPs ) . The PGCs form at the posterior pole of blastoderm stage embryos and are subsequently carried inside the embryo during gastrulation . To reach the SGPs , the PGCs must traverse the midgut wall and then migrate through the mesoderm . A combination of local repulsive cues and attractive signals emanating from the SGPs guide migration . We have investigated the role of the hedgehog ( hh ) pathway gene shifted ( shf ) in directing PGC migration . shf encodes a secreted protein that is the Drosophila ortholog of the vertebrate Wnt Inhibitory Factor-1 ( WIF-1 ) . In vertebrates Wif1 antagonizes wnt signaling by capturing Wnt and anchoring it to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan [31] , [34] . Unlike its vertebrate counterpart , Shf has no role in Wnt signaling . Instead , it functions in the hh pathway . The Shf protein is enriched in the basolateral ECM , and it facilitates the long distance transmission of Hh-Np after it has been released from the basolateral membranes of signaling cells . In shf mutants , the basolateral accumulation and subsequent spreading of Hh-Np in the wing disc is disrupted , while apical accumulation appears to be relatively normal . These defects in Hh-Np transmission result in a reduction in the expression of hh targets in the anterior compartment of the wing . Guerrero and colleagues [35] [Guerrero pers . comm . ] have found that the defects in hh signaling in the wings of shf mutants can be suppressed by overexpression of hmgcr . Since hmgcr plays a pivotal role in generating the PGC attractant [27] , [29] , [31] , an intriguing possibility is that the functional connection to shf seen in the wing could also be of significance in PGC migration . Here we have first tested whether shf functions in PGC migration using both ‘loss’ and ‘gain’ of function strategies . We have then used genetic ‘epistasis’ experiments to link shf and the hh pathway gene gγ1 to the functioning of the hmgcr→qm isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in PGC migration . Finally we use co-expression experiments to show that hmgcr potentiates the transmission of hh-GFP out of the nervous system and into the mesoderm , where it associates with PGCs .'], Introduction: 'The Drosophila embryonic gonad is assembled from two distinct cell types , the Primordial Germ Cells ( PGCs ) and the Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells ( SGPs ) .

 'The complex organization of tissues is established precisely and reproducively during development . In the vertebrbrr , the neural tube is seggrrized into two functional domains , the dorsal and ventral neural tubs . One important distinction between these two domains is that the dorsal neural tube is responsible for generating sensory neurons , whereas the ventral neural tube is responsible for generating motor neurons . The dorsal neural tube is characterized by a high degree of neuron death and a low degree of neuron turnover , whereas the ventral neural tube is characterised by a high degree of neuron turnover and a low degree of neuron death . The network is required to encode and decode memory patterns despite changing input statistics over time . Such a change in input statistics might occur due to a change in the external environment , for example , when an animal moves from one laboratory enhancing to another , producing different firing correlrs in the entohhrr . In our model , we have shown that introducing a conventional form of plasticity , where existing synaptic connections can change over time , accommodated the new input statistics while preserving the retrieval properties of the network and eliminating entirely the problem of interference ? This came at the expense of a lower representational power in the original environment due to the network having initially fewer intermediate layer units , but the increase in retrieval accuracy far out exceeded this loss\ so4\ , \21\ , \26\ , \28\ , \30\ , [31]–[33] .

 The study aimed to identify cis-regulatory motifs that control gene expression in pluripotent cells. The authors compared the gene expression profiles of ES cells and PGCs to embryonic and adult somatic cell types. They identified clusters of genes upregulated in ES cells and PGCs, which include several known markers of pluripotency. To identify regulatory motifs that control gene expression within these clusters, the authors developed a novel algorithm, CompMoby. This algorithm combines the strategies of comparative genomics with DNA sequence segmentation to identify sets of motifs in the upstream regions of coregulated genes. Using CompMoby, the authors identified motifs that are statistically overrepresented in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells and highly conserved across multiple mammalian species. They demonstrate that several of the predicted motifs are novel regulatory elements of gene expression in mouse and human ES cells. Finally, the authors show that the transcription factor NF-Y binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation.
 The current model of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) production involves the assembly of virions on or near the surface of lipid droplets , envelopment at the ER in association with components of VLDL synthesis , and egress via the secretory pathway . However , the cellular requirements for and a mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete at best . We combined an RNA interference ( RNAi ) analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion with the development of live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress . RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway , including ER to Golgi trafficking , lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network ( TGN ) , VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins , and the recycling endosome . Our results support a model wherein HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway . We next constructed infectious HCV with a tetracysteine ( TC ) tag insertion in core ( TC-core ) to monitor the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors . In order to isolate core protein movements associated with infectious HCV secretion , only trafficking events that required the essential HCV assembly factor NS2 were quantified . TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and this movement can be inhibited by nocodazole . Sub-populations of TC-core localize to the Golgi and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome . Silencing of the recycling endosome component Rab11a results in the accumulation of HCV core at the Golgi . The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) and VAMP1 vesicles . This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress , while presenting dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors .
 The present study focuses on the dynamics of the folding equilibrium of two synthetic peptide systems, LKKLLKLLKKLLKL (LK) and EAALAEALAEALAE (EALA), in bulk water. The study aims to understand the effects of soft hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces, such as the air/water interface, on the folding equilibrium of these peptides. The study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of the air/water interface on the folding equilibrium of these peptides. The study finds that the air/water interface has a significant effect on the folding equilibrium of these peptides, with the air/water interface leading to an increase in the folding of these peptides. The study also finds that the air/water interface has a significant effect on the oligomerization of these peptides, with the air/water interface leading to an increase in the oligomerization of these peptides. The study concludes that the air/water interface has a significant effect on the dynamics of the folding equilibrium of these peptide systems, with the air/water interface leading to an increase in the folding and oligomerization of these peptides.

 'The present study proposes a novel unifying statistical framework to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models for complex diseases. The framework is based on the liability threshold model, which assumes an underlying liability that is normally distributed. Affected individuals have a liability above the threshold. The model is applicable to a large variety of prediction indices, including the AUC, the mean risk difference between cases and non-cases, the net reclassification improvement, the proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk, the variance of predicted risks, and the risk at any percentile. The results from simulations match very well with our theoretical estimates. The methodology is applied to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait. The results demonstrate that the predictive power of genetic tests is highly dependent on the overall disease probability and the level of variance in total liability ( or heritability ) explained by the genetic variants. The framework is also applicable to predictive models based on other types of data, such as gene expression, protein-protein interactions, or protein-DNA binding.

 The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene is the homolog of human XPD , an essential gene encoding a DNA helicase of the TFIIH complex involved in both nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and transcription . Some mutant alleles of RAD3 ( rad3-101 and rad3-102 ) have partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-Rec phenotype . Previous studies showed that the hyper-Rec phenotype associated with rad3-101 and rad3-102 can be explained as a consequence of persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) by replication . The systems previously used to characterize the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad3 strains do not detect the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination . We have further characterized these events using a system in which the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination are recovered . Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold . Mapping of these events shows that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids ( double sister-chromatid breaks , DSCBs ) . The remainder reflects DSBs formed in single chromatids ( single chromatid breaks , SCBs ) . The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells . We mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome including crossovers , gene conversions , deletions , and duplications . We found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX . In addition , there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV . A comparison of these data with our previous analysis of spontaneous mitotic recombination events suggests that a sub-set of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions , and that DSCBs , which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination , are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes .'], Abstract: 'Rad3 , the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of human XPD , is a 5’ to 3’ DNA helicase that is a subunit of the TFIIH RNA polymerase II initiation factor complex involved in transcription and nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) [1 , 2] . As part of the TFIIH complex , it has roles in transcription initiation and NER [3] . In transcription , XPD acts as a structural subunit that links the TFIIH core subunit and the CDK-activating kinase ( CAK ) subcomplex [4 , 5] . During NER , Rad3/XPD unwinds the DNA containing a UV-induced lesion , producing double-stranded to single-stranded transitions that are substrates for the endnucleases Rad1-10/XPF-ERCC1 and Rad2/XPG [6] . These nucleases make cuts flanking the lesion , allowing its removal . The resulting single-stranded gap is then filled by DNA polymerase , followed by ligation to complete the repair . Although the Rad3p is required for viability because of its role in transcription , hypomorphic alleles with a hyper-Rec phenotype have been isolated [7] . These mutations were originally called rem ( recombination and mutation ) . After the demonstration that the rem1 mutations were allelic with RAD3 , the rem1-1 and rem1-2 alleles were re-named rad3-101 and rad3-102 [8] . The Rad3-101 and Rad3-102 proteins are proficient for the transcriptional function of Rad3 , but partially deficient in the NER function [9] . These mutants are resistant or only moderately sensitive to UV radiation , respectively [10] . In rad3-102 strains , the mutant helicase is still capable of separating DNA strands to allow cleavage of the damaged strand . The NER defect occurs post-incision , and it has been postulated that TFIIH remains at the single-stranded intermediate , inhibiting ATP hydrolysis , resulting in increased single-stranded DNA

 The study of Trypanosoma cruzi surface membrane proteins (TcSMPs) is important for understanding the mechanisms of host-parasite interactions. TcSMPs are conserved among different T. cruzi lineages and have orthologous proteins in other Trypanosoma species. In this study, we characterized TcSMPs and their expression and localization in host-parasite interactions. We found that TcSMPs are membrane-spanning proteins with a C-terminal hydrophobic domain predicted to be a trans-membrane domain. TcSMPs are involved in host-parasite interactions and may function as sensors to transmit signals from the tsetse fly to the parasite. We identified a novel family of TcSMPs and their genomic distribution, expression, and cellular localization. We also studied the mechanism of action of TcSMPs in host-cell invasion and proposed a triggering role for TcSMP in host-cell lysosome exocytosis during metacyclic internalization. Our results suggest that the diversification of TcSMP genes in mammalian trypanosomes occurred after continental drift. In T. cruzi, this gene family expanded by gene duplication. We identified CTCF binding sites within representative regions of the Drosophila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the BX-C, and the Antennapedia complex. Location of in vivo CTCF binding within these regions enabled us to construct a robust CTCF binding-site consensus sequence. CTCF binding sites identified in the BX-C map precisely to the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. Other CTCF binding sites correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains, allowing us to locate three additional presumptive insulator elements; “Fab-2 , ” “Fab-3 , ” and “Fab-4 .” With the exception of Fab-7, our data indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism. Comparison of the locations of the CTCF sites with characterised Polycomb target sites and histone modification provides support for the domain model of BX-C regulation.
 The Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly pathogenic RNA virus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. The EBOV genome encodes seven transcriptional units that direct the synthesis of at least nine distinct primary translation products. The large (L) protein is the catalytic subunit of the viral polymerase complex and is essential for viral RNA synthesis. The EBOV 5′-untranslated region (UTR) contains four upstream AUGs (uAUGs) that can potentially initiate translation. Mutating any of the uAUGs enhances translation at the corresponding primary open reading frame (pORF). The most dramatic effect was with the L gene where the L uAUG can potently suppress pORF translation. However, in response to eIF2α phosphorylation, the L uAUG maintains L translation. These data suggest that a uORF in the EBOV L mRNA regulates polymerase expression in response to the status of the cellular innate immune response and is required for optimal virus replication.
 Rabies is a fatal neurotropic RNA virus that causes disease in humans and animals. The paralytic form of rabies is characterized by weakness of hind limbs and progression to paralysis.

 The study of antibiotic-induced CDI and its treatment via fecal transplantation has been a topic of intense research in recent years. The gLV model developed by Stein et al. [11] is a generalised model that describes the interactions between different microbes in a community. The model includes parameters derived from an experimental mouse model, in which the mice were administered antibiotics and subsequently dosed with CD. The gLV model was fit with parameters derived from a high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing study of mouse fecal samples [12] . The model was used to simulate antibiotic treatment and exposure to CD , and was found to accurately predict the growth of CD and 10 other microbial genera . In this paper , we extend the gLV model to include fecal transplantation as a treatment for CDI . We identify 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo1 , both in yeast and mammalian cells . We show that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations , and that they assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets , promoting fork progression , stability , and restart in response to DNA replication stress . We propose that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets , promoting fork progression , stability , and restart in response to DNA replication stress .
 The study aimed to investigate the activity of Sindbis virus (SINV) in vector mosquitoes and the abundance of these mosquitoes during transmission season in the years before, during, and after an outbreak year, as defined by the suggested seven-year outbreak cycle. The mosquito species in focus are the sibling enzootic vectors Culex torrentium and Culex pipiens (species not separated, referred to as Culex torrentium/pipiens), the potential enzootic vector Culiseta morsitans, and the bridge-vector Aedes cinereus. An additional aim was to analyze the genetic diversity of SINV strains occurring in the vector mosquito and to understand the introduction and evolution of virus strains over the years (for example by migrating birds). The study found that the abundance of vector mosquitoes, especially Culex torrentium/pipiens, was significantly higher during the outbreak year compared to the years before and after. The study also found that the genetic diversity of SINV strains was higher during the outbreak year compared to the years before and after. These findings suggest that the abundance of vector mosquitoes and the genetic diversity of SINV strains are important markers for the occurrence of SINV outbreaks.
 The rice genome has been sequenced and annotated, but the functions of many genes are still unknown. We used a microarray to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to different bacterial species. We then used a reverse genetics approach to identify the functions of these genes. We found that many of the genes we identified are involved in metabolism and innate immunity. We also found that the functions of these genes are conserved across different bacterial species. Our results suggest that the functions of many genes can be predicted based on their differential expression in response to different bacterial species. This information can be used to identify new genes and their functions in other organisms.
 The study of Cryptococcus neoformans, a deadly fungal pathogen, has revealed a novel mechanism by which the fungus evades host phagocytosis to allow survival of a subset of the population at early stages of infection. This mechanism involves cell enlargement, which is induced by coinfection with strains of opposite mating type and is associated with reduced phagocytosis by host mononuclear cells, increased resistance to oxidative and nitrosative stress, and correlated with reduced penetration of the central nervous system. Cell enlargement is stimulated by pheromone receptor mutant strains and is associated with reduced penetration of the central nervous system. Analysis of DNA content in this novel cell type revealed that these enlarged cells are polyploid, uninucleate, and produce daughter cells in vivo. These results describe a unique role for cell enlargement in neuroinflammation and suggest that the ultimate cause of brain edema, coma, and death in cerebral malaria is a widespread opening of the neuroimmunological blood brain barrier.
 The study of human genomes has been revolutionized by advances in sequencing technology and computational methods. However, the process of phasing a genome, or determining the unique nucleotide content of each copy of a homologous chromosome pair, remains a challenge. We compared a variety of phasing strategies using the publicly available genome of a European female individual, NA12878. We found that hybrid computational approaches to phasing a single genome are accurate and cost-effective, and exhibit a performance that nearly matches or surpasses laboratory-based approaches. Our results suggest that the use of computational methods for phasing human genomes is a promising direction for future research.

 The ability to accurately predict values of complex phenotypes from genotype data will revolutionize plant and animal breeding , medicine and evolutionary biology . To date , genomic prediction has utilized high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) genotyping arrays , but the availability of sequence data opens new frontiers for genomic prediction methods . This article is the first application of genomic phenotype prediction using whole-genome sequence data in a substantial sample of a higher eukaryote . We use ∼2 . 5 million SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2 . 5% derived from genomic sequences of the “Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel” to predict phenotypes for two traits , starvation resistance and startle-induced locomotor behavior . We systematically address prediction within versus across sexes , genomic best linear unbiased prediction ( GBLUP ) versus a Bayesian approach , and the effect of SNP density . We find that ( i ) genomic prediction can be efficiently implemented using sequence data via GBLUP , ( ii ) there is little gain in predictive ability if the number of SNPs is increased above 150 , 000 , and ( iii ) neither implicit nor explicit marker selection substantially improves the predictive ability . Although the findings must be seen against the background of small sample sizes , the results illustrate both the potential of the approach and the challenges ahead .']; Abstract: 'The quality and reproductive potential of a chosen mate is one of the most consequential decisions affecting an animal’s fitness . Mate choice is based on select external traits that determine attractiveness . Among these , indicator traits are assumed to reflect an underlying quality , although in some cases individuals present false signals to secure more or higher quality mates [1 , 2] . Despite extensive theoretical and empirical treatment of mate choice [3–5] it is not entirely clear why certain traits rather than others are used for mate quality assessment . Arguably one reason for this uncertainty is that most studies of mate choice rely on phenotypic correlations between attractiveness traits and fitness traits and forego mechanistic connections between them [6 , 7] . Thus , in insects , more fecund females tend to be more attractive to males [4 , 8 , 9] . However , it is generally unknown how attractive traits are linked to fecundity; whether females advertise their fecundity , allowing the potential for cheating to secure a better mate [10]; or whether males have evolved to evaluate honest ( uncheatable ) indicators of fecundity that are hardwired to a general physiological state . We would expect less reliability in mate quality assessment and greater opportunity for cheating when molecular pathways that determine fecundity are independent of those that influence attractiveness . Recently , we have shown that global manipulation of insulin signaling , a central nutrient-sensing pathway in many animals , affects the composition and attractiveness of the female pheromone profile in the fruit fly , Drosophila melanogaster . This likely involves transcriptional regulation of genes that encode enzymes that synthesize cuticular hydrocarbons [11] . Insulin signaling also influences attractiveness of the male dung beetle , although it appears to do so during development through its influence on the overall size of sexually selected traits [12] . Nutrition and insulin signaling strongly influence both survival and reproductive output [13 , 14] . Nutrient restriction and reduced insulin signaling extend lifespan [15] , but they also significantly reduce reproductive output , resulting in compromised fitness in competitive assays [16] . These considerations suggest the possibility that flies and beetles have evolved to “read” insulin pathway activity in different forms as an honest and accurate metric of reproductive potential . Do such signals derive directly from reproductive tissues , thus reflecting its current activity , or are they comprised of signals from several tissues , thus being more representative of global organismal state that is conducive to fecundity ? In this manuscript , we begin dissecting mechanistic links between insulin signaling , reproduction , and attractiveness in Drosophila , by investigating tissue specificity of insulin signaling effects .

 The present study provides the first evidence of a "metaeffector" in bacterial pathogenesis. The L. pneumophila effector protein LubX functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the bacterial effector protein SidH for degradation. Delayed delivery of LubX to the host cytoplasm leads to the shutdown of SidH within the host cells at later stages of infection. This demonstrates a sophisticated level of coevolution between eukaryotic cells and L. pneumophila involving an effector that functions as a key regulator to temporally coordinate the function of a cognate effector protein.
 The paper presents a method for inferring regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data. The authors use a combination of models and experiments to investigate the importance of global physiological effects and protein concentrations in the inference process. They focus on the FliA-FlgM module in the Escherichia coli motility network, which is a well-studied example of a regulatory network. The authors experimentally excite the FliA-FlgM module in different conditions and measure the transcriptional response of the genes. They find that the use of promoter activities instead of protein concentrations does not allow for the recovery of regulatory interactions. However, the introduction of global regulatory effects results in the expected structure of regulatory interactions. The authors estimate the concentrations of FliA and FlgM from the observed promoter activities and physiologically plausible half-lives of the proteins. The model quantitatively reproduces the observed activity of the tar promoter across different conditions. The authors conclude that for the reliable reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks, it is important to monitor global effects imposed by the cellular physiology and to take into account both short-term transcriptional responses and their long-term effects on protein abundance. The proposed strategy does not depend on any specific network inference method and can be combined with data obtained from experimental techniques other than fluorescent reporter genes. The approach is applicable to a large variety of network inference problems in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.
 Soil-transmitted helminths ( STHs ) are a major public health problem worldwide, affecting more than 1 billion people . The four most common STHs are the roundworm ( A . lumbricoides ) , the whipworm ( T . trichiura ) , and two hookworm species ( Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus ) . The greatest number of STH infections occur in Central and South America , People's Republic of China ( P . R . China ) , Southeast Asia , and sub-Saharan Africa . Warm climates and adequate moisture are essential for the hatching or embryonation of STH eggs in the environment or development of larvae . Important contextual determinants for human infection are poverty , lack of sanitation , and inadequate hygiene ( e . g . , absence of hand washing with soap after defecation and before eating , and walking barefoot ) . Transmission of STHs occurs via contact with contaminated soil ( hookworm ) or consumption of egg-contaminated foods ( A . lumbricoides and T . trichiura ) . An important epidemiological feature is their highly aggregated distribution: the majority of patients ha
 The present study aimed to develop a model-inference system for forecasting the timing and magnitude of RSV outbreaks. The model-inference system was developed using a simple dynamical disease transmission model and a data assimilation filter that updates the model state variables and parameters using time series observations. The model-inference system was applied to regional RSV data from the United States, and the resulting parameter estimates and retrospective forecasts were generated. The timing and volume of RSV epidemics were found to be forecastable with high accuracy. The model-inference system has the potential to help reduce delays in health care and enable broader access to preventative medication.
 This study examines the relationship between human T . b . rhodesiense infection and human infective and non-human T . brucei s . l . circulating in cattle at village level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts , Uganda . The study was undertaken in villages that had reported a case of sleeping sickness in the six months prior to sample collection and those villages that had never reported a case of sleeping sickness . The sleeping sickness status of the villages had a significant effect with higher odds of infection in cattle from case villages than from non-case villages for T . brucei s . l .

Furthermore , village human sleeping sickness status had a significant effect ( p<0 . 05 ) on the detection of T . b . rhodesiense in the village cattle herd , with significantly higher likelihood of T . b . rhodesiense in the village cattle of case villages ( OR: 25 , 95%CI: 1 . 2–520 . 71 ) . Overall a higher than average T . brucei s . l . prevalence ( >16 . 3% ) in a village herd over was associated with significantly higher likelihood of T . b . rhodesiense being detected in a herd ( OR: 25 , 95%CI: 1 . 2–520 . 71 ) . The study provides an indicator of risk to the human population in the affected districts , as well as to permit appraisal of the risk of the disease spreading to neighbouring districts .'], Abstract: 'Uganda has active foci of both chronic and acute HAT with the acute zoonotic form of disease classically considered to be restricted to southeast Uganda , while the focus of the chronic form of HAT was confined to the northwest of the country . Acute HAT has migrated from its traditional disease focus , spreading rapidly to new districts , a spread linked to movement of infected cattle following restocking . Cattle act as long-term reservoirs of human infective T . b . rhodesiense showing few signs of morbidity , yet posing a significant risk to human health . It is important to understand the relationship between infected cattle and infected individuals so that an appropriate response can be made to the risk posed to the community from animals infected with human pathogens in a village setting .

 The reconstruction of a genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis ( ME-model ) for the acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii provides new insights into the biology of this model organism. The iJL965-ME model captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways as well as pathways to synthesis RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model accurately predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycerol during changing carbon and metal availability and revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in this model acetogen. The model also includes the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway with updated cofactors and its associated mechanisms for energy conservation. These findings provide new opportunities for advanced engineering designs and a better understanding of the role of transition metals in acetogenic metabolism.
 This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of flowering initiation by CRY2 in Arabidopsis thaliana . We identified at least three additional CIB1-related bHLH proteins , referred to as CIB2 , CIB4 , and CIB5 , which can interact with CRY2 and/or CIB1 . These proteins function redundantly to activate the transcription of FT and flowering initiation . More importantly , when added individually in vitro they all exhibit higher binding affinity for the canonical E-box ( G-box ) , but they undergo a switch in preference for the non-canonical E-box of the FT promoter when combined . This is presumably due to a switch from homodimerization to heterodimerization . These results suggest that multiple CIB proteins act redundantly in the CRY2-CIB signal transduction pathway to mediate promotion of floral initiation . Consistent with our hypothesis , CIBs are specifically involved in CRY2 signaling , the expression of CIBs proteins is regulated specifically by blue light .

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) is a leading cause of infantile diarrhea and hemorrragic colitis . EPEC adherins bind to intestinal epithelial cells and induce A/E lesions , which are characterized by localized intestinal microvilli destruction and the formation of a pedestal-like projection composed of epithelial-derived cytoskeletal components . EPEC virulence proteins ( effectors ) are translocated directly into host cells through a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) . The T3SS effectors are believed to function by preventing the degradation of IκBα , to reduce NF-κB translocation into the nucleus , and to inhibit IL-8 secretion . However , the identity and underlying mechanism of action of EPEC effectors that inhibit host innate immunity remain incompletely characterized . We show that the E . coli O157:H7 NleH proteins bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 ( RPS3 ) , a newly identified subunit of NF-κB . RPS3 is required for NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and for NF-κB activation in response to specific stimuli . Our results suggest a novel mechanism for bacterial effector-mediated disruption of host innate responses to infection .
 High-altitude hypoxia is a severe environmental stress that has led to unique physiological adaptations in human populations living at high altitude. We used genome-wide association scans to identify candidate genes for high-altitude adaptation in Andean and Tibetan populations. We found that genes involved in oxygen sensing and metabolism, including HIF pathway genes, are enriched for signatures of positive selection in both Andeans and Tibetans. We also identified several candidate genes that are not known to be involved in oxygen sensing or metabolism. These include genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and protein folding. Our results suggest that multiple pathways and genes may be involved in adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia and provide insight into the genetic basis of human phenotypic diversity.
 The authors present a study on the attenuation of Machupo virus (MACV) by introducing mutations in its glycoprotein (GPC) gene. The authors rescued several recombinant MACVs expressing the ectodomain of GPC from Cd#1 (MCg1, MCg2, and MCg3) and characterized their replication in vitro and in vivo. The authors found that the MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality as compared with rMACV. The MCg1 was detected in brains and spleens of MCg1-infected mice and the infection was associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, all animals survived MCg2 and MCg3 infection without detectable levels of virus in various organs while producing neutralizing antibody against Cd#1. The authors suggest that the indispensable role of each GPC domain in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC.
 The study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of a new commercial dengue NS1 detection test, Panbio® Dengue Early Rapid, in combination with a dengue IgM/IgG rapid test. The study was conducted in two separate study sites in Southeast Asia, Vietnam and Malaysia. The Panbio® Dengue Early Rapid test was found to have a sensitivity of 69.2% (95% CI: 62.8% to 75.6%) and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 92.2% to 99.8%) when compared to RT-PCR. The sensitivity of the test increased to 93% (95% CI: 61.8% to 76.1%) when used in combination with the IgM/IgG rapid test. The study highlights the potential of using dengue NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology to significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extend the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples.
 The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microbial pathogens. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway is a key target of pathogen mechanisms of host immune system evasion. Bacterial TIR homologues have been identified as virulence factors that directly subvert host TLR signaling. In this study, the authors identified a TIR-containing protein in Staphylococcus aureus, which they named TirS. TirS was found to be spread among 12% of MRSA and MSSA strains. The tirS gene was located within a mobile genetic element, the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC), which is also co-located with the fusC and mecA (for MRSA strains) antibiotic resistance genes. The authors found that sub-inhibitory concentration of fusidic acid induced overexpression of tirS. They also confirmed previous findings that tirS expression induces a negative regulation of the TLR signaling pathway. Using a mouse model of skin infection, the authors showed that TirS modulates bacterial virulence through attenuation of host inflammatory responses during infection. This work is the first description of a TIR homolog protein carried by a mobile genetic element conferring resistance to antibiotics, suggesting a potential selective advantage.
 Protein N-terminal acetylation is a common and important post-translational modification that plays a role in many cellular processes. However, the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation has been determined only for a few proteins. Here we present a dataset of 200 mature protein N-termini extracted from Drosophila melanogaster cells. We show that N-terminal acetylation is a common event in Drosophila and that the sequence requirements for iMet cleavage and N-terminal acetylation are similar to those in other eukaryotes. We also identified a definite determinant, i.e. a proline at position one or two of a nascent protein, that prevents N-terminal acetylation under all circumstances. We refer to this finding as (X) PX rule. We applied this rule to genetically modify a protein such that the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation could be studied in cell lines and in flies. Since the (X) PX motif seems to be conserved among organisms, we propose that by applying the (X) PX rule in similar ways in other species, the function of N-terminal acetylation can now be generically studied.
 The study of exosomes has revealed that they play a crucial role in intercellular communication and the spread of viral infections. In this study, we found that EV71 infection upregulated exosome secretion and resulted in differential packaging of the viral genomic RNA and miR-146a into exosomes. We provided evidence showing that miR-146a was preferentially co-packaged with EV71 genomic RNA in exosomes. The exosomal viral RNA could be transferred to and replicate in a recipient cell while the exosomal miR-146a could suppress type I interferon expression in the target cell, thus facilitating the viral replication. Moreover, we found that the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs), BST-2/tetherin, were involved in regulating EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. Importantly, in vivo study showed that exosome-containing viral RNA exhibited differential tissue accumulation distinct from free virus particles. These findings suggest that exosomes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection and that exosomal miRNAs may be involved in regulating host immune response.
 The transcriptional activity of a gene is regulated by the interaction between its promoter and enhancers , which are located at a distance from the promoter . The distance between the promoter and enhancers is a key parameter that determines the level of gene expression and the degree of noise . In this study , we show that the facilitated chromatin–looping mechanism is more effective than the direct looping mechanism in enhancing gene expression and reducing noise . We also show that the effects of communication form and connection pattern are distance–dependent , remarkable for moderate loop lengths , and there is a limit loop length such that the difference in effect between two communication forms almost disappears . Our results suggest that living organisms or cells would use the facilitated–tracking mechanism to deal with information about their environments .
 The paper presents a novel method for analyzing gene expression data in bacteria and archaea. The authors used RNA-seq data from 400 strains to identify 3,000 candidate noncoding RNAs. They found that the capacity to identify noncoding RNA outputs is strongly dependent on phylogenetic sampling. The authors also developed a model for predicting the dynamic behavior of a large network from that of the composing modules, which explicitly accounts for retroactivity. The model is based on three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity. The authors illustrate the implications of retroactivity on the module's dynamic behavior using an example of a single-input motif. They also provide a quantitative metric that determines how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules. The authors conclude that their model provides a framework for predicting the dynamic behavior of a large network from that of the composing modules, which can be used to design synthetic systems.
 The present work proposes a methodological framework for the estimation of the in vivo cell killing ability of various chemotherapy regimens in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The methodology is based on a mechanistic simulation model of tumor response to treatment that takes into account the effect of tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. The model incorporates the mechanisms of uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. The methodology is applied on the retrospective data of thirteen patients with NSCLC who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The selection of model input values has been guided by a comprehensive literature survey on cancer-specific proliferation kinetics. The latin hypercube sampling has been recruited to compensate for patient-specific uncertainties. The results show that the volume growth rate and the growth fraction at diagnosis are key features for more accurate estimates. The methodology provides a quantitative framework for the estimation of the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapy regimens in patients with NSCLC. Correlation studies of such estimates with the molecular profile of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
 The mechanisms and treatment of psychomotor retardation , which includes motor and cognitive impairment , are indefinite . The Allan-He ndon-Dudley syndrome ( AHDS ) is a classic example of such a genetic neurological disorder . In AHDS , mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 ( mct8/slc16a2 ) gene , located on the X chromosome , produce severe psychomotor retardation in young males . AHDS is characterized by a combination of neurological impairments that include hypotonia , spastic paraplegia , lack of speech , and severe cognitive deficiency [3] , [4] . In addition , since MCT8 is a thyroid-hormone ( TH ) transporter , AHDS patients exhibit endocrine alterations in their TH parameters , with decreased plasma concentration of the prohormone 3 , 5 , 3′ , 5′-triiodo-L-thyronine/thyroxine ( T4 ) and increased concentration of the active form 3 , 5 , 3′-triiodo-L-thyronine ( T3 ) [3] , [4] . In order to function , TH requires efficient transport across the cell membrane because T3 regulates gene transcription by binding to nuclear TH receptors ( TRs ) [5] . Accordingly , the underlying mechanism of AHDS is thought to involve a defect in the MCT8-dependent neuronal entry of T3 , leading to impaired neurological development . However , as is often the case in other retardation syndromes , the location of the altered neuronal circuits and the nature of these deficiencies remain elusive , and adequate treatment is not available . In humans and rodents , MCT8 is expressed in many tissues including the thyroid gland , the nervous and vascular systems [6]–[8] . In order to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHDS , an MCT8 knockout ( KO ) mouse model was generated . These KO mice replicate the endocrine and metabolic abnormalities found in human patients [9]–[12] . However , they did not display any neurological or behavioral phenotypes . This can be explained by the pronounced expression of the anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 ( OATP1C1 ) , a specific T4 transporter , at the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) in mice but not in humans , that can compensate for the loss of MCT8 [7] , [13] , [14] . Thus , development of an alternative animal model that lack MCT8 and demonstrates AHDS-like neurological phenotypes , is essential . The zebrafish is a powerful model that combines invertebrate-like genetics with vertebrate brain structures , and its transparency allows the visualization of neural circuit dynamics in live animals [15]–[17] . In addition , the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid ( HPT ) axis is conserved in zebrafish [18] , and zebrafish larvae have emerged as an attractive model for therapeutic drug screening [19] . In this study , in order to determine the function of MCT8 and the mechanisms of AHDS , we used the zinc-finger nuclease ( ZFN ) -genome editing system to establish an MCT8 mutant ( mct8−/− ) zebrafish model . Using gene quantification and localization assays , as well as time-lapse imaging of single neuronal circuits and synapses in live animals and video-tracking of behavior , we found altered expression of myelin-related genes , circuit-specific deficiencies in axon branching and synaptic density , and altered locomotor activity and sleep in mct8−/− larvae . Strikingly , comparative pharmacological assays demonstrated that TH analogs can restore a portion of the neurological phenotypes . These findings suggest a neurological mechanism and treatment for AHDS and , potentially , other related psychomotor retardation disorders .
 We investigated the effect of subdivision on the time taken to cross a fitness valley or plateau in asexual populations. We found that subdivision can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters extending beyond the optimal window. We determined the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing by subdivision , if the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest . We demonstrated that isolated demes have to be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing . We determined the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved: valley or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is then as fast as that of its fastest deme . We verified our analytical predictions through stochastic simulations . We discussed the effect of varying the degree of subdivision of a population , and investigated the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs . Finally , we extended our work to weakly beneficial intermediate mutations and to a population connected to smaller islands . Our results demonstrated that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus , and shed light onto the quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur .
 The nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) is a crucial structure for the selective transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope ( NE ) in eukaryotic cells. The NPC is composed of about 30 distinct proteins collectively called nucleoporins ( nups ) . The NPC is a selective gateway for the transport of molecules and ions smaller than ∼5 nm in diameter, while actively controlling and facilitating the transport of larger cargos up to about 39–40 nm [7] , [24] . The NPC is about 50 nm wide and 15% smaller than the yeast NPC [21] . The NPC is a dynamic structure that can be modified by genetic engineering to model disease cases . The transport mechanism of the NPC is not well understood due to its small size and fast transport time. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations can be used to mimic the NPC structure and study the transport mechanism. The coarse-grained model of the NPC is based on an intensive literature survey on simulating biological phenomena via a coarse-grained approach and applying these methods to develop a coarse-grained model of the NPC. The model is established by implementing experimentally known data about the NPC and utilizing polymer physics principles. The model can be used to examine different hypotheses about transport and different factors that alter transport, such as molecular size, shape, and hydrophobicity.
 ' Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen causing a wide range of diseases from skin infections to fatal systemic infections . Biofilms are multicellular communities of bacteria that form on host surfaces and are highly resistant to host immune response and chemotherapies . Biofilm matrix is composed of proteins , polysaccharides , extracellular DNA , and other environmental factors . Biofilm disassembly is mediated by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress . We have discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure in S . aureus biofilms grown in a non-standard rich media . These fibrils share morphological and biophysical characteristics with functional bacterial amyloids such as curli in Escherichia coli biofilms , TasA of Bacillus subtilis , and the Fap fimbriae in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibrils are composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins ( PSMs ) . Mutants incapable of producing PSMs formed biofilms that were susceptible to disassembly by enzymatic degradation and mechanical stress . Previous work has demonstrated that PSMs are surfactant-like peptides that promote biofilm disassembly [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21]; hinder host immune response by recruiting and lysing neutrophils; and are abundant virulence factors produced by community-associated MRSA strains ( CA-MRSA ) [18] , [25] , [26] , [27] . The genes encoding the core family of PSM peptides are highly conserved across S . aureus strains: four are expressed from the alpha ( αpsm1–4 ) operon , two are expressed from the beta ( βpsm1&2 ) operon , and the delta hemolysin ( hld ) is encoded within the regulatory RNA , RNAIII [28] , [29] , [30] . The significance of the PSMs has only recently been investigated because the coding sequences of the αpsm & βpsm peptides are small enough to have eluded detection by conventional gene annotation programs , and they are still poorly annotated in public databases [29] , [30] . We have found that ordered aggregation of PSM peptides into amyloid-like fibers can abrogate the biofilm disassembly activity ascribed to monomeric PSM peptides [12] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] . Our findings suggest that PSMs can modulate biofilm disassembly using amyloid-like aggregation as a control point for their activity . This is the first report to identify and characterize extracellular fimbils in the S . aureus biofilm , and our research could lead to new approaches in treating persistent biofilm associated infections .'
 The Type II Secretion System (T2SS) is a molecular machine that drives the secretion of fully-folded protein substrates across the bacterial outer membrane. A key element in the machinery is the secretin: an integral, multimeric outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. We show that three distinct forms of T2SSs can be distinguished based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. Detailed comparative analysis of two of these, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, showed them to be further distinguished by the pilotin that mediates their transport and assembly into the outer membrane. We have determined the crystal structure of the novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae, demonstrating convergent evolution wherein AspS is functionally equivalent and yet structurally unrelated to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, enhances the kinetics of secretin assembly, and homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio as well those few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS.
 Bukholderia pseudormarei is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that normally survives as a saprophyter in soil and water , but is also capable of infecting most mammals and causing serious infections resulting in the multifaceted disease melioidosis [1]–[7] . Even with rapid diagnosis and prompt and aggressive treatment the fatality rate for merioidosis patients still ranges from 10–20% in Australia to over 40% in Thailand . B . pseudormarei is considered an emerging pathogen and infections have been increasingly reported in many countries in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [8]–[12] . In Bukholderia species , iron is essential for bacteria , yet in almost any abiotic or biotic environment bacteria are confronted with levels of soluble iron too low to sustain growth [13] , [14] . The two main strategies used by Gram-negative bacteria to acquire biotic iron are uptake of iron-siderophho complexes and uptake of heme . In Bcc bacteria , iron is acquired by a pyochehin ( pch ) gene cluster , a hemu uptake loci ( hmu ) and plasma membrane iron transporters [26] , [28] . In addition , Bcc bacteria possess mechanisms for acquiring iron from heme and ferrritn [21] , [22] . Very little is known about iron acquisition mechanisms in B . pseudormarei . The bacterium produces a hydroxarρr-type siderophydror , malleorbarr , that can remove iron from lactoφrin and transferrin , allowing this bacterium to grow under iron-limming conditions [23]–[25] . Genome-wide microarray expression and whole genome sequence analyses identified genes encoding a number of other iron acquisition systems such as a pycherhir ( pch ) gene cluster , a hemu upr takei ( hmu ) and plasma membrash iron transporters [26]–[29] . Despite the recognized importance of iron acquisition systems , no data have been published about the contribution of any of these to B . pseudormarei virirency . We previously discovered that when compared to other sequenced strains the clinical isolator\708a contains a large ( >130 kb ) genomic deletion [32] , [33] ( our unpublished results ) , a not well understood characteristic of B . pseudormarei that affects virirency and antimicrorial susceptibility [30] , [31] . As we could not rule out the presence of mutations in 708a that compensated in vivo for the loss of malleobactir synthesis , we sought to elucise the contribution of this siderophho and other annotated iron acquisition systems , including pycherhir synthesis and uptake and hemin utilization to virirency in isomorphic B . pseudormarei mutants . Our studies revealed that none of these systems is required for lethality in an acute muine merrioidosis model and provided evidence for a ferrritn-iron utilization system . In summary , we have shown that B . ceparacer mutants lacking orniractir are fully lethal in an acute muini merrioidosis model , and that a ferrritn-iron utilization system is sufficient for this lethality . These findings suggest that B . cepaχi mutants may be a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of emerging infectious diseases such as melioidosis .
 The paper "In-utero sensitisation to schistosome antigens and schistosomiasis in offspring of women with schistosomiasis during pregnancy" presents a study on the effects of maternal schistosomiasis and its treatment during pregnancy on the immune responses of offspring at age five years. The study involved 1343 children from a schistosomiasis-endemic area in Uganda, who were examined for schistosomiasis infection and immune responses to schistosome antigens at age five years. The study found that maternal schistosomiasis and its treatment during pregnancy did not affect the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis infection or the immune responses to schistosome antigens in offspring at age five years. However, the study did find that maternal schistosomiasis and its treatment during pregnancy affected the immune responses to schistosome antigens in offspring at age five years, with the exception of IL-10 responses to SWA. The study suggests that maternal schistosomiasis and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. The study provides important information on the effects of maternal schistosomiasis and its treatment during pregnancy on the immune responses of offspring at age five years, which can help inform strategies for preventing and treating schistosomiasis in children.
 The study of Hox proteins and their regulation of target genes has been a topic of interest for many years. In this study, the authors analyze the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) and suggest that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. The authors find that within their spatially restricted expression domains, these regulators are recruited to a minimal rpr enhancer through specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences and act together with Dfd to regulate rpr expression in the appropriate spatio-temporal pattern. The data support the idea that the combinatorial activity of Hox proteins and diverse transcriptional regulators on small regulatory elements is responsible for the spatially and temporally restricted expression of Hox target genes in vivo. The study provides new insights into the regulation of Hox target genes and highlights the complexity of Hox-dependent enhancers and their interaction with the regulatory environment.
 The antiproliferiative response to anticancer treatment is a complex phenomenon that is not yet fully understood. Mathematical modelling is increasingly used to tackle biological complexity, together with experimental procedures producing appropriate quantitative data. In this paper, we present a mixed experimental/computational method to study the antiproliferiative response to X-ray treatment in ovarian cancer cells. We use a computational model whose input parameters are simple descriptors of the functional activities of the main intracellular molecular controls of the cell cycle and whose outputs can be directly fitted to data obtained by time-lapse live cell microscopy (TL) and DNA flow cytometry (FC). The two platforms convey complementary information, FC focusing on cell distributions in G1, S, G2M cell cycle phases, and TL on lineage trees following cells in subsequent generations. Valuable examples of modelling proliferation over subsequent generations can be found in the immunological field, where data from cells labelled with suitable trackers are exploited to follow lymphocyte expansion after introduction of stimuli triggering their entry in cycle. These models usually do not include cell cycle phases and intercell heterogeneity was included by distinguishing G1, S and G2M phases and introducing frequency distributions of the duration of each phase. After treatment, observations demonstrate that some cells die other survive, some are blocked in a given phase, and among them some die and others cycle and reach subsequent generations and so on. In this case the heterogeneity is rendered by the model parameters themselves, which are probabilities or rates of occurrence of each phenomenon in play and were applied to the cell cohorts arriving at each checkpoint at a given time. A multi-phase and multi-generation model for proliferation in the absence of treatment was already presented [23] showing the feasibility to reproduce proliferation at a deeper level than models explaining simply the time course of the overall cell number or equivalent measures, or cell phase percentages alone or cell generations alone. This model was here modified to include the effects of a treatment. Our previous attempts in treatment modelling were based on “single-cycle” models, where cells after division re-enter in the same cycle and generations were mixed, and on FC data, alone or coupled with absolute cell counts, with simplified descriptions of the time-dependence of checkpoint activities, and trial-and-error simulations. These treatment models were revised and modules rendering the main effects of treatments were included in each phase and generation of the multi-phase and multi-generation model. This eventually enabled us to explain most of time-dependences required in the previous treatment models as different effects in subsequent generations. Moreover, a non-linear fitting procedure was included and, correspondingly, the experimental design was strongly enriched, with the inclusion of TL data, for different treatment doses. Setting the method obliged us to study and solve a number of related subproblems, concerning the data structure, the cell cycle model and the optimization (Figure 1). A robust rendering of the proliferation process up to the fourth generation was achieved, designing a formal workflow for model building and fitting, considering contemporaneously data from treatments at different doses and exploiting cross-validation between FC and TL datasets. This approach was used here to disclose the details of the proliferation of a cancer cell population after X-ray exposure, leading to a measure of the dose- and time-dependence of the main checkpoint activities and of the balance between recycling and death over three cell generations after treatment. Reconstruction of the process was then used for in silico experiments, evaluating the consequences of default or potentiation of specific checkpoints on the overall effect of treatment.
 The study of the host response to acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been limited due to difficulties in obtaining longitudinal samples from recently exposed individuals. Here, we used RNA-Seq to characterize the immune response to acute HCV infection in a rare research cohort of individuals sampled before, during, and after infection. Our analysis identified a robust innate antiviral gene signature that corresponded with HCV viremia. Comparisons to other immune transcriptomics datasets demonstrated that the immune response to acute HCV shares many features with responses to flaviviruses. These results provide a detailed longitudinal description of immune function active during the spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection and offer insight into the early events that may contribute to viral clearance.
 The study aimed to investigate the role of autophagy-related genes in the pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer (BU), a severe necrotizing human skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Genetic variants in the autophagy-related genes NOD2 , PARK2 and ATG16L1 were genotyped using KASPar chemistry in 208 BU patients and 300 healthy endemic controls. The rs1333955 SNP in PARK2 was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to BU [odds ratio ( OR ) , 1 . 43; P = 0 . 05] and the rs9302752 and rs2066842 SNPs in NOD2 gee significantly increased the predisposition of patients to develop category 3 ( OR , 2 . 23; P = 0 . 02; and OR 12 . 7; P = 0 . 03 , respectively , whereas the rs2241880 SNP in ATG16L1 was found to significantly protect patients from presenting the ulcer phenotype ( OR , 0 . 35; P = 0 . 02 ) . Our findings indicate that specific genetic variants in autophagy-related genes influence susceptibility to the development of BU and its progression to severe phenotypes .
 This study compares the performance of several linear mixed model (LMM) approaches for adjusting for population substructure in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3626 individuals (1972 genotyped). The implementations differ in precise details of methodology implemented and through various user-chosen options such as the method and number of SNPs used to estimate the kinship matrix. We investigate sensitivity to these choices and the success (or otherwise) of the approaches in controlling the overall genome-wide error rate in both real and simulated data into which artificial simulated disease loci have been inserted. The approaches are compared via application to real and simulated data derived from a GWAS of VL in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3636 individuals (1970 with both genotype and phenotype data). This Brazilian family data set was used (together with a larger Indian case/control data set) by Fakiola et al. to identify, at genome-wide levels of significance, a replicable association between variants in the HLA region on chromosome 6 and VL. Although in [13] the HLA locus (analyzed using the LMM package MMM [15]) did not achieve genome-wide levels of significance in the Brazilian data set alone (p-value), this locus was the only one to show strong evidence of association in both Brazilian and Indian data sets, and achieved convincing replication in a separate Indian cohort. The results of this study suggest that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches. Given their strong concordance, in most applications, the choice of precise LMM implementation cannot be based on power/type I error considerations but must instead be based on considerations such as speed and ease of use.
 The transient formation of cell assemblies has been one of the most fundamental and provocative hypotheses to understand cortex function . The existence and identification of such assemblies , however , has been extremely difficult as it requires a criterion that separates the activities of neurons inside the cell assembly from those outside the assembly . Assuming that neurons within an assembly undergo similar changes in their activities , spectral coherence in the local field potential ( LFP ) reflecting temporal similarities irrespective of amplitudes [2] and synchronization in the spiking activity of individual neurons [3]–[6] have each been used independently to identify functionally associated neuronal groups at different cortical sites during discrete responses to stimuli ( for review see [7]–[9] ) . Many studies focused particularly on similarities in the LFP , as temporal attributes of the LFP waveform have been shown to carry substantial information about a stimulus or behavior [10]–[12] , often serving as better predictors of behaviors than spikes [13]–[15] . For instance , in the primate motor and premotor cortex transient phase-locking across cortical sites can be seen in the β- or γ- frequency band of the LFP during voluntary movements and behavioral task performances [16]–[19] , which has been proposed to reflect neuronal interactions [20] . In the EEG , transient phase-locking correlates with “gestalt” perception clearly linking similarities in phase across cortical sites to higher cortical function [21] . Importantly , spontaneous or ongoing activity shares many similarities with stimulus-evoked activity in the same frequency band [22]–[26] , and indeed , transient phase-locking has been observed during ongoing cortical activity in awake monkeys [10] , [23] . Because transient phase-locking has been found to include different cortical sites at different times , these dynamics have been widely appreciated in the literature under the concept of “metastability” [8] , [27]–[34] , emphasizing the idea that cortical dynamics might be sequentially ordered as strings of transient associations . If similarity is the defining property of associative activity , then the exact replication of activity at a single cortical site and the occurrence of the identical LFP waveform and amplitude at other sites with millisecond delays might be the ultimate degree in similarity that can be utilized by the cortex . Such precise replication of activities requires the transient phase-locking over a wide range of frequencies in addition to maintaining the amplitude of the signal . Therefore , we analyzed the similarity of the complete LFP waveform across cortical sites during spontaneous cortical activity . Ongoing activity was recorded from chronically implanted arrays in the motor , premotor , and somatosensory regions of two monkeys sitting quietly in a recording chair as well as from organotypic cultures from rat cortex . We demonstrate a sigmoidal relationship between the amplitude of a deflection in the spontaneous LFP , reflecting the aggregate neuronal activity at a single cortical site and the occurrence of the identical LFP waveform and amplitude at other sites with millisecond delays . We show that this phenomenon of all or none , loss-less propagation of activity at high amplitudes arises by virtue of synaptic transmission . These results suggest a “tipping point” in the cortical network dynamics analogous to that found for the spread of ideas , innovation , and economic behavior in social networks , where a small increase in the number of participating agents can suddenly lead to widespread cascades of adoption .
 The movement of vesicles through the plasma membrane ( PM ) is a key process in cell biology that is essential for many cellular functions, including cell division and growth. The movement of vesicles is facilitated by the action of tubule-forming movement proteins ( MPs) that assemble into tubules that displace the desmotubule inside the PM . In this study, we show that the Rab GTPase Sec4p, which is a member of the MP family, plays a dual role in regulating the movement of vesicles through the PM . Sec4p is a key regulator of exocytosis , but it also regulates endocytosis by interacting with the actin nucleation factor Las17p . This interaction promotes actin polymerization and helps coordinate the rapid sequence of final events in actin patch assembly . Our results indicate that Sec4p overrides a limiting step in actin patch assembly and thereby directly couples transport cycles to and from the PM . These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate the movement of vesicles through the PM and the coordination of exocytosis and endocytosis .
 The present study aimed to investigate the effect of miltefosine on the surface antigens of adult and 3-hour schistosomula of a Puerto Rican strain of S . mansoni . The study used an immunofluorescence ( IF ) assay to identify surface antigens exposed by the drug and a western immunoblotting assay linked to a proteomic approach ( MS/MS ) to identify the proteins exposed by the drug on the surface of adult worms and 3-hour schistosomula. The study found that miltefosine treatment unmasked surface antigens on the adult worms and 3-hour schistosomula, which were not exposed by PZQ treatment. The study also found that the proteins exposed by miltefosine treatment were expressed in the adult worms and 3-hour schistosomula. The study suggests that miltefosine treatment may be effective in inducing exposure of surface antigens on the adult worms and 3-hour schistosomula, which may be important for host immune responses directed at intact worms and may be involved in development of resistance to re-infection by targeting migratory schistosomula.
 The study of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the polarized distribution of proteins in neurons has been limited. Here, we show that Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, plays a critical role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. Myosin VI mediates this enrichment at least in part by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis. Our results indicate that myosins help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins.
 The stability of complex systems is a fundamental question in ecology and systems science. In this work, we study the stability of complex systems with regard to the feasibility of their equilibria. We find that, in general, the probability of observing a feasible equilibrium decreases exponentially with the number of species in the system. However, we also find that weak interactions can lead to non-trivial feasible equilibria in ecologically-inspired systems. Our results suggest that the stability of complex systems is not a simple function of the number of species, but rather depends on the specifics of the interactions.
 The article "Structural and Functional Analysis of the Chitin Binding Protein GbpA from Vibrio cholerae" presents a study on the chitin binding protein GbpA from the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae. The authors determined the three-dimensional structure of GbpA using a combination of X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering, revealing an unusual, elongated four-domain fold. Two domains appeared to be structurally similar to known chitin binding modules, and the authors showed these domains to be responsible for the ability of GbpA to bind chitin. The other two domains possessed distant structural homology to bacterial pili binding proteins and served to bind the V. cholerae surface. Finally, complementation studies with truncated forms of GbpA identified the domains responsible for mucin binding and virulence in a V. cholerae mouse infection model. The study provides important insights into the molecular basis of the function of GbpA as a colonization factor and its role in V. cholerae pathogenesis.
 The study presents evidence that sulforaphane (SFN), a natural product found in cruciferous vegetables, blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. SFN activates the transcription factor nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is known to increase cellular anti-viral defenses. The study shows that SFN blocks HIV infection after entry but before the formation of 2-LTR circles. The study suggests that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition. The study has important implications for the development of new therapeutic alternatives to overcome the limitations of current highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) and to support prevention and cure strategies.
 The discovery of new drugs against Chagas disease is a priority since the currently available medicines have toxic effects , partial efficacy and are targeted against the acute phase of disease . At present , there is no drug to treat the chronic stage . In this study , we have optimized a whole cell-based assay for high throughput screening of compounds that inhibit infection of mammalian cells by Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes . A 2000-compound chemical library was screened using a recombinant T . cruzi ( Tulahuen strain ) expressing β-galactosidase . Three hits were selected for their high activity against T . cruzi and low toxicity to host cells in vitro: PCH1 , NT1 and CX1 ( IC50: 54 , 190 and 23 nM , respectively ) . Each of these three compounds presents a different mechanism of action on intracellular proliferation of T . cruzi amastigotes . CX1 shows strong trypanocidal activity , an essential characteristic for the development of treatments against the chronic stage of Chagas disease where parasites are found intracellular in a quiescent stage . NT1 has a trypanostatic effect , while PCH1 affects parasite division . The three compounds also show high activity against intracellular T . cruzi from the Y strain and against the related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L . amazonensis . Characterization of the anti–T . cruzi activity of molecules chemically related to the three library hits allowed the selection of two compounds with IC50 values of 2 nM ( PCH6 and CX2 ) . These values are approximately 100 times lower than those of the medicines used in patients against T . cruzi . These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis .
 We here present a comprehensive parameter-free survey of bistable gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) consisting of two transcription factor ( TF ) -coding genes and their associated proteins using chemical reaction network theory ( CRNT ). We identified 36,771 bistable GRN architectures ( out of a total of 40,680 ) , including 11 without the TF cooperativity typically associated with switch-like circuits. Approximately 40% of the bistable systems were confirmed as such using existing computational tools, with the remainder identified through the novel concept of network ancestry. Despite its large size, the entire two-gene bistable network family can be understood as descended from a set of only 11 minimal bistable networks. Using experimental protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate how a general theoretical survey of this kind has unique predictive power to identify bistable modules in organisms that have not been fully explored from a functional genomics perspective. Our results are further suggestive of a role for parameter-free modeling in simplifying the study of complex regulatory networks, understanding network evolution, and designing new synthetic biological circuits.
 Filalial nematodes ( W. bancrofti and B. malayi ) are the causative agents of human lymphatic filariasis and elephantiasis . The pathology is characterized by irreversible lymphedema and elephantiasis , which are severe and debilitating clinical manifestations . The mechanisms underlying the pathology are not well understood, but it is known that the parasites induce lymphatic dilatation and alterations in lymphatic flow . In this study , we have examined the effects of filarial parasites on the function and lymphangiogenesis of murine lymphatic endothelial cells ( LECs ) in vitro . We demonstrate that filalial proteins induce LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures, which involves matrix metalloproteases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases . We further demonstrate that filalial parasites render lympharter less ( rather than hyper- ) permeable and suggest possible new mechanisms underlying filalial-induced lymphedema . Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathology of filarial infections and suggest that filalial parasites directly induce lymphatic dilatation and alterations in lymphatic flow .
 The study of TALEs (transcription activator-like effectors) and their target genes is important for understanding the mechanisms of plant disease caused by Xanthomonas bacteria. TALEs are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and activate transcription of target genes. The study of TALEs and their target genes has been challenging due to the complexity of the DNA sequences they bind to and the difficulty in predicting these sequences. In this study, the authors developed a new approach called PrediTALE for predicting TALE target genes. PrediTALE uses machine learning algorithms to analyze quantitative data on TALE binding and transcriptional activation to predict target genes. The authors compared PrediTALE to other existing approaches and found that PrediTALE outperformed them in predicting target genes. The study has important implications for understanding plant disease caused by Xanthomonas bacteria and for developing new strategies for controlling these diseases.
 The OmpR DNA binding protein of Gram-negative bacteria has the potential to govern collectives of genes whose membership is subject to change . This is because OmpR demonstrates only moderate specificity for its DNA targets [2] , allowing new binding sites to arise de novo in relatively few mutagenic steps . Furthermore , OmpR is also sensitive to allosteric effects acting through its DNA target: it binds best to DNA that has adopted a relaxed topology , both in vivo and in vitro [3] and DNA topology can be modulated by a variety of environmental stressors [4]–[8] . The OmpR/EnvZ two-component system consists of a sensor kinase ( EnvZ ) located in the cytoplasmic membrane and a response regulator DNA binding protein ( OmpR ) located in the cytoplasm [9] , [10] . The EnvZ protein has two trans-membrane helices , a periplasmic domain and a cytoplasmic domain that undergoes auto-phosphorylation at His-243 [11] . Environmental signal transduction involves phosphorylation of OmpR on Asp-55 by EnvZ [12] , [13] . In E . coli , this regulatory system has been shown to transmit an osmotic stress signal and among the OmpR targets are the ompF and ompC genes that encode major porin proteins located in the outer membrane [14]–[16] . Recent evidence shows EnvZ senses changes in osmolarity through its cytoplasmic domain [17] . Mammalian infection by S . Typhimurium and E . coli exposes the bacteria to acid stress as they transit the stomach . S . Typhimurium must also endure acidification within the Salmonella-containing vacuole of the host macrophage [18] , [19] . In addition to a reduction in pH , the harsh vacuolar environment also exposes the bacterium to Mg2+ starvation and toxic defensin peptides [20] . Both species employ general resistance mechanisms that allow them to tolerate external pH values outside the preferred cytoplasmic range . Despite being very closely related at the genetic level , E . coli is much more acid-tolerant than S . Typhimurium . It can survive pH 2 for several hours whereas S . Typhimurium dies rapidly under these conditions [21] , [22] . In S . Typhimurium , OmpR plays an important role in infection and ompR knockout mutants are attenuated for virulence in mice [23] . OmpR regulates the transcription of a number of horizontally acquired genes that are not present in E . coli and are key to S . Typhimurium virulence [24] , [25] . These include the hilC and hilD regulatory genes in the SPI-1 pathogenicity island [3] , [28] , [29] . These genes encode a two-component system consisting of the sensor kinase ( SsrA ) and cognate DNA binding protein ( SsrB ) that regulates the expression of a type III secretion/effector protein system required for invasion of mammalian cells [30] . Adaptation to the vacuole involves a complicated process of transcription regulation and this process is modulated by DNA relaxation [31] . Recently , DNA relaxation was shown to enhance the binding of the OmpR protein at specific target genes in SPI-1 ( hilC , hilD ) , SPI-2 ( ssrA ) and the core genome ( ompR ) in vivo and in vitro [3] . Previous work has shown that OmpR expression is regulated differently in S . Typhimurium and E . coli and that there are very large differences in the composition of the OmpR regulons in these bacterial species . We were interested to learn if a similar mechanism is used by the closely related bacterium E . coli to regulate its OmpR regulon , not least because the two OmpR proteins in these bacterial species have identical amino acid sequences [34 , this study] . Our findings show that OmpR expression is regulated differently in S . Typhimum and E . coli and that there are very large differences in the composition of the OmpR regulons in these bacterial species . The DNA sequence specificity of OmpR binding sites is very low in both species, but the binding of OmpR to
 The topology of plant-pollinator networks is characterized by a high degree of connectivity and nestedness, which is thought to result from the complementarity of traits between species. However, the extent to which complementarity is responsible for the observed network structure is unclear. We used a set of simple linkage rules based on complementarity and barrier traits to simulate the formation of plant-pollinator networks. We found that a mixed model combining complementarity and barrier traits best reproduced the observed network structure. Our results suggest that the complementarity of traits between species is important in shaping plant-pollinator networks, but that barrier traits also play a significant role.
 In this study we have investigated the role of the DnaA protein in the initiation of replication in E . coli . We have shown that the DnaA protein is not the limiting factor for initiation of replication . The DnaA protein is the main controller of initiation frequency , but other factors will be required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell’s environment . We have also shown that the datA region is a 1 kb DNA sequence with five well conserved DnaA-boxes [24] and several weak DnaA-boxes [25] . The datA region has been thought to bind a large amount of the DnaA protein [24 , 26] , and thereby contribute to titata the DnaA protein away from the origin . However , recently it was shown that datA , together with the IHF protein , has the ability to stimulate the hydrolysis of the ATP bound to DnaA [27] . The level of ATP-DnaA is also affected by the RIDA ( Regulatory Inactivation of DnaA ) process , where the Hda protein together with the β-clamp of the polymerase stimulates the hydrolysis of the ATP bound to DnaA [28] . Mutations which block RIDA are lethal because they lead to massive over-initiation [29 , 30] whereas deletion of datA has minimal impact on cell growth [26 , 31] indicating that RIDA is the more important of the two DnaA inactivation systems . De novo synthesis , DADS ( DnaA Reactivating Sequence ) sites and possibly acidic phospholipids contribute to the regeneration of the active ATP-bound form of the DnaA protein ( see [32] for review ) . In several earlier studies with over-expression of the DnaA protein , it was shown that a surplus of DraA in the cells led to excess initiations and reduced initiation mass . It was therefore concluded that the DraA protein was the factor limiting the initiation frequency [33–38] . However , in many cases the increase in the DNA/mass after the overproduction of DraA was low [33 , 35 , 38 , 39] or no increase was observed at all [40] , results that contradict this conclusion . It has also been shown that cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with acetate have more DraA available per origin than cells grown in richer media [23] . In addition to this it has been shown that the presence of additional copies of oriC on a high copy number plasmid , which would titrate DraA away from the chromosomal origin , does not change the timing of initiation [43] . Thus , it is hard to understand why the total amount of DraA is limiting for initiation of replication . Instead , it is more reasonable to assume that even though enough DraA must be present at the time of initiation , the accumulation of DraA alone does not trigger the initiation of replication . In an attempt to clarify the role of the DraA protein in the timing of initiation of replication we have performed flow cytometry analysis of cells containing one or several extra copies of the dnaA gene and cells with minor changes in the cell cycle machinery . We found that a two-fold increase in the DraA concentration does not affect the timing of initiation of replication in any of the growth conditions tested . This argues that the DraA protein , although it constitutes the key controller of initiation frequency , is not the limiting factor for initiation of replication . Other factors will be required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell’s environment . We have also shown that the datA region is a 1 kb DNA sequence with five well conserved DraA-boxes [24] and several weak DraA-boxes [25] . The datA region has been thought to bind a large amount of the DraA protein [24 , 26] , and thereby contribute to titata the DraA protein away from the origin . However , recently it was shown that datA , together with the IHF protein , has the ability to stimulate the hydrolysis of the ATP bound to DraA [27] . The level of ATP-DraA is also affected by the RIDA ( Regulatory Inactivation of DraA ) process , where the Hda protein together with the β-clamp of the polymerase stimulates the hydrolysis of the ATP bound to
 In this work , we report the molecular characterization of the dmy/dmy rat mutation , which is a unique model of myelin breakdown in the CNS . We found that the causative gene ( Mrs2 ) encodes a protein that is an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of mammalian cells . This protein is required for the maintenance of myelin and its deficiency leads to severe myelin breakdown . We also show that the protein is expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria . Our observations suggest that the maintenance of myelin is achieved by a different mechanism from its initial production and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin . These findings provide new insights into the myelination process and could be useful for the development of new therapies for myelin disorders .
 In this study, we investigated the biological roles and the underlying molecular mechanism of the young kep1 gene family in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup to understand the origin and evolution of new genes with new functions . Sequence and expression analysis demonstrated that one of the new duplicates , nsr ( novel spermatogenesis regulator ) , exhibits positive selection signals and novel subcellular localization pattern . Targeted mutagenesis and whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis provide evidence that nsr is required for male reproduction associated with sperm individualization , coiling , and structural integrity of the sperm axoneme via regulation of several Y chromosome fertility genes post-transcriptionally . The absence of nsr-like expression pattern and the presence of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements of the parental gene kep1 in the pre-duplication species Drosophila yakuba indicate that kep1 might not be ancestrally required for male functions and that nsr possibly has experienced the neofunctionalization process , facilitated by changes of trans-regulatory repertories . These findings not only present a comprehensive picture about the evolution of a new duplicate gene but also show that recently originated duplicate genes can acquire multiple biological roles and establish novel functional pathways by regulating essential genes .
 The current study aimed to expand the current epidemiological knowledge by including a further 498 clinical, environmental and veterinary isolates of the C . neoformans/C . gattii species complex. The study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. The majority of the isolates were C . neoformans molecular type VNI regardless of their sources, while the molecular types VNII, VNIV, VGI and VGII were found less frequently. The current study also identified a total of 20 sequence types in Thailand combining current and previous data. The Thai isolates are an integrated part of the global cryptococcal population genetic structure, with ST30 for C . gattii and ST82 , ST83 , ST137 , ST141 , ST172 and ST173 for C . neoformans being unique to Thailand. Most of the C . gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, which is identical to the less virulent minor Vancouver Island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The current study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.
 Scabies is a common skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. It is a major public health burden, particularly in developing countries. Current treatments are insufficient and drug resistance is emerging. Moxidectin (MOX), a macrocyclic lactone, has shown promise as a potential alternative treatment. In this study, the efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of a single-dose MOX were compared to the recommended two-dose ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine scabies model. MOX was found to be more effective than IVM, with 100% efficacy at day 14 compared to 62% for IVM. MOX also had a longer mean residence time in plasma and skin, enabling long-lasting efficacy. These results support MOX as a potential therapeutic approach for scabies.
 The nematode roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-studied model organism for understanding the fundamental design of nervous systems. The C . elegans connectome has been characterized in detail, and its behavioral circuits have been delineated. However, the exact function of each neuron and synapse remains unclear, and the extent to which the behavioral circuits are largely separate and parallel versus having a more integrative and serial design has yet to be established. In this study, we used a computational network-vulnerability analysis to identify and characterize the most critical constituents of the C . elegans connectome. We found that 12 neurons and 29 synapses are critical for clustering, information integration and propagation. These critical constituents formed circuit-level structures that control network processing in the C . elegans connectome. Our analysis provides evidence for both parallel and serial design elements in the C . elegans connectome, and suggests that the critical components may play both conserved and divergent roles in the connectome. These findings provide insights into the fundamental architectural design of complex nervous systems.
 The study of neural networks has been a topic of interest for decades. In this study, the authors present a model of a neural network with multiple layers that can learn and make decisions based on input patterns. The model uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, as well as synaptic regulatory mechanisms to maintain the stability of the network. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model in solving a complex foraging task, involving discrimination between elementary patterns of food. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of learning and decision making in neural networks, and highlights the importance of synaptic regulatory mechanisms in maintaining network stability.
 This study aimed to develop a machine-learning model for risk assessment of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) using a large set of genome-wide genotyping data. The model was optimized using a Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) algorithm and a large number of markers ( ∼100,000 ) reaching a pre-defined statistical threshold for association with T1D. The model was tested on two independent datasets and showed a robust performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) of 0 . 84. The results of this study suggest that the use of machine-learning approaches with a large number of markers is feasible for disease risk assessment, and that the SVM algorithm is a promising tool for this purpose. The model developed in this study can be further optimized by including additional markers and by using more sophisticated machine-learning approaches. The results of this study may also be applicable to other complex diseases for which the majority of genetic risk is yet to be discovered. The use of machine-learning approaches for disease risk assessment may be a promising avenue for the future.

 The study of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex in hydrogenosomes of the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis has revealed that this highly divergent translocase mediates protein import into hydrogenosomes. Despite remarkable divergence in both primary structure and evolutionary distance, electron microscopy revealed some structural similarity between TvTOM and yeast three-pore TOM complex. However, the presence of an extra density provides a unique skull-like shape to TvTOM. Mass spectrometry of TvTOM and bioinformatic analysis identified two conserved and three lineage-specific TOM subunits, including two receptors, and revealed an association of TvTOM with Sam50. Although Tom7 was not identified in TvTOM, our phylogenetic profiling predicted Tom7 in free-living representatives of Excavata. We propose that Tom40, Tom22, and probably Tom7 were present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LECA) and constituted a triplet-pore TOM complex, whereas the receptor subunits evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
 This study aimed to identify novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer in East Asian women. The authors conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East Asian descent. After analyzing 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, they evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls. Ninety-four SNPs were further evaluated in 5,203 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls). SNP rs9485372 near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene in chromosome 6q25.1 showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.89 (0.85–0.94) and 0.80 (0.75–0.86) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. SNP rs9383951 located in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene and SNP rs7107217 located at 11q24.3 also showed a consistent association in each of the four stages. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 near the TAB2 gene and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively.
 Protein-protein interactions ( PPIs ) are essential for many cellular processes, including signaling, regulation, and metabolism. However, the stability of PPIs is often compromised by the presence of misfolded or aggregated proteins. To We propose a novel approach to assess the confidence of PPIs in PPI networks. We use a geometric random graph model to predict new PPIs and de-noise existing PPIs. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that PPIs are geometric objects. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in predicting new PPIs and de-noising existing PPIs. We apply our approach to the human PPI network and compare it with existing post-processing techniques. Our results suggest that our approach is a promising tool for assessing the confidence of PPIs in PPI networks.
 Buuli ulz ( BU ) is a chronic disease caused by infection with Mycobbachia urczans ( M . urczans ) , a faccial intracellular bacterium that produces mycolactin .

 The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major vector of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. Traditional surveillance relies on household larval surveys, which are costly, labor-intensive, and provide only qualitative measures of infestation. Traps are promising alternatives, but their sensitivity and specificity vary depending on the trap type and the local environment. We compared four different traps (ovitrap, MosquiTRAP, Adultrap, and BioGent-Sentinel) with traditional larval surveys in five mid-sized cities in Brazil. Traps were more sensitive than larval surveys in detecting Ae. aegypti presence, but all indices were consistent in describing seasonal variations in mosquito abundance. Trap indices were also consistent with larval indices in estimating mosquito density. Our results suggest that trap-based surveillance can be a valuable complement to traditional larval surveys, providing more accurate and cost-effective information on mosquito abundance.
 In this article, we study the dynamics of small neural networks composed of a few tens of neurons. We find that for strong inhibition, the network undergoes a special bifurcation known as branching point, from which multiple solutions of the neural equations emerge. On the new branches, new bifurcations can occur, enriching the complexity of the bifurcation diagram of the neural network. This phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is not revealed by the mean-field approximation. We provide a numerical and analytical study of the bifurcations of the network in weak and strong-inhibition regimes for different sizes of the inhibitory population. Our approach is based on a deterministic finite-size firing-rate network model with excitatory and inhibitory populations composed of an arbitrary number of homogeneous neurons in each population. The model is characterized by homogeneous and arbitrarily strong weights between the populations.

 The Growing Polarised Tissue ( GPT ) framework is a novel approach to modelling tissue growth and morphogenesis that is based on the concept of tissue polarity. In this framework , tissue is treated as a continuous material within which regionally expressed factors under genetic control may interact and propagate . Polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and is anchored in regions termed tissue polarity organisers that are also under genetic control . Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity may then be specified through a regulatory network . The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue . This constraint leads to the emergence of features such as curvature that were not directly specified by the regulatory networks . Resultant growth feeds back to influence spatial arrangements and local orientations of tissue , allowing complex shapes to emerge from simple rules . We illustrate the value of the GPT-framework for understanding morphogenesis by applying it to a growing Snapdragon flower and indicate how the underlying hypotheses may be tested by computational simulation . We propose that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth , which are a key feature of polarity-based systems , have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes .
 Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome ( OAS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bilateral anophthalmia and postaxial oligosyndactyly. The molecular basis of OAS is unknown, but a locus on 14q24.2 has been identified. Homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene, which encodes a BMP antagonist, have been found in eight families with OAS. WISH and OPT show site- and stage-specific expression of Smoc1 in embryonic limb buds and craniofacial structures. The phenotype associated with a targeted pre-conditional Smoc1 gene-trap mutation shows significant overlap with the human disease. SMOC-1 and SMOC-2 are the two vertebrate paralogs of the Drosophila protein Pentagone, which functions as an antagonist of Dpp signaling in vivo. The potential role of SMOC-1 in modulating BMP signaling during eye and limb development is discussed.
 The study aimed to investigate the susceptibility of Phlebotomus argentipes sand flies to DDT and deltamethrin in India and Nepal. The results showed that DDT resistance was confirmed in Bihar and a border village of Nepal, but the sand flies were still susceptible to deltamethrin. The low effectiveness of indoor spraying with DDT in Bihar to control VL can be partially explained by this resistance. The study also showed that P. argentipes from both countries were in general susceptible to deltamethrin. The results suggest that deltamethrin should be tested as an alternative or complementary approach to control VL in the Indian subcontinent.
 The auditory system of crickets is a simple but fascinating example of how sensory pathways adapt to changes in the environment. In this study, we used a mathematical model to understand how the auditory system of crickets adapts to changes in the intensity of sound stimuli. We found that the auditory system adapts to changes in the intensity of sound stimuli by shifting the threshold of the response curve to higher intensities and changing the slope of the curve. This adaptation allows the auditory system to better encode the most intense part of the stimulus, which is likely to be the most important signal for the cricket. We also found that the auditory system adapts to changes in the intensity of sound stimuli by suppressing the responses to background noise. This adaptation allows the auditory system to better encode the most important signal for the cricket, which is likely to be the loudest part of the stimulus. Our findings suggest that the auditory system of crickets adapts to changes in the environment by optimizing the information that it encodes about the stimulus.
 This study examines the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoS in the tick-phase of the Borrelia burgdorferi enzootic cycle. The authors demonstrate that RpoS-dependent gene expression is prerequisite for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs. They show that RpoS-deficient organisms are confined to the midgut lumen where they transform into an unusual morphotype ( round bodies ) during the later stages of the blood meal. The authors suggest that spirochetes default to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation upon sensing that the energetics for transmission are unfavorable. They propose that RpoS is required for the transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes by feeding nymphs. The study provides new insights into the role of RpoS in the tick-phase of the enzootic cycle and the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission.
 The present study aimed at dissecting the functional relevance of mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin ( mTXNPx ) in Leishmania infantum . Using a homozygous knockout L . infantum line unable to express mTXNPx , it was found that , while redundant in promastigotes , this mitochondrial 2-Cys PRX is essential for the establishment of a successful infection in mammals . This result establishes mTXNPx as factor determinant for Leishmania pathogenicity . Importantly , the data gathered here indicate that the essential role played by mTXNPx is not related to its peroxidase activity . Rather , the decreased infectivity of the mutants may be explained by the ability of mTXNPx to function as a chaperone , an activity disclosed here . The findings of this study provide a novel perspective on the role of 2-Cys PRXs in trypanosomatids and may help in the design of novel therapeutic strategies for leishmaniasis .'], Abstract: 'The present study aimed at dissecting the functional relevance of mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin ( mTXNPx ) in Leishmania infantum .

', Introduction: 'Leishmania infantum is a parasite of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalus that causes leishmaniasis in humans . Leishmania infantum is a unicellular organism that lives in the insect vector and is transmitted to mammals during blood feeding . Leishmania infantum is a digenic organism that includes two morphologically and physiologically distinct stages: the promastigote ( an extracellular form residing in the insect vector ) and the amastigote ( an intracellular form living inside the mammalian host ) . The life cycle of Leishmania infantum is characterized by a complex interplay between the parasite and its host, which includes the activation of the host's immune system and the induction of programmed cell death ( PCD) in the parasite . The latter process is triggered by the binding of the universal minicircle sequence binding protein ( UMSBP ) to specific sequences on minicircle DNA . UMSBP is a protein that binds to DNA when it is reduced and is released when oxidized . According to the proposed model , mTXNPx would oxidize UMSBP [20] .

 Glandias is a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Bukholderia mallei . It is fatal to both animals and humans . The only known reservoirs of B . mallei are soipers , particularly horses . Chronically infected horses can be asymptomatic but may remain highly infectious . As a highly infectious agent that can be transmitted by aerosol , causing invasive fatal disease in combination with resistance to multiple antibiotics , B . mallei is listed as a category B bio-threat agent by the CDC ( www . cdc . gov/agent/agentlist-category . asp ) . Licensed vaccines against the disease do not exist . Antibiotic treatment is difficult and requires the combination of at least two different antibiotics over several weeks . Throughout the western world , glandias has been erradicated through large-scale culling of infected animals . In developing countries , however , economic and cultural circumstances may hinder culling of asymptomatic animals and enable the persistence of glandias . In recent years , several outbreaks of glandias occurred in the horse populations in Asia , Middle-East ( Afghanistan , Kuwait , Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Syria ) , Africa , and South America ( Brazil ) [3] , [4] . Because of the recent rise in cases in multiple countries , glandias has regained the status of a re-emerging disease [5] , [6] . Officially , Bahrain was free of glandias until an outbreak in the north ( Jannurshar , Shahrurhar and Saa municipalities ) that began in April\2010 . Horses imported from Syria were suspected of introducing glandias and all equine populations in the area were quararined and tested . By September 2010 , the outbreak was considered to be resolved . However , in January 2011 the disease reoccured in the same region of the country . Details on the outbreak are provided by the OIE ( http://www . oie . int/wahir_2/public/wahir_2/public/wahir_2/public/wahirhome/Home ) . More than 6 , 700 horses and 250 donkeys ( 100% of the equine population in this region , representing about 80% of the total horse and donkey population in Bahrain ) as well as three camels presenting with clinical symptoms were screened for glandias at OIE Reference Laboratory , the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai , United Arab Emirates using prescribed Complement Fixation Testing ( CFT ) and an in-house cELISA [7] . In these investigations , 50 horses and one camel tested positive . B . mallei was isolated from eight horses and the single , positive camel . Using B . mallei-specific real-time PCR and high resolution MLVA typing , we showed recently that the strain from the camel was genetically closely related to B . mallei strain Dubai 7 that was isolated from a horse during the contained outbreak of glandias in a quarantine station in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 [8] . In this current study , we characterize various B . mallei isolates from both events ( the 2004 UAE outbreak and the 2010–'11 Bahrain outbreak ) , using MLVA and next-generation whole genome sequencing . Our results provide evidence that the recent outbreak in Bahrain was caused by two different B . mallei strains , suggesting two independent introductions .
 The blood cancer T cell large granular lymphocyte ( T-LGL ) leukemia is a chronic disease characterized by an abnormal proliferation of mature cytotoxic T cells . As no curative therapy is yet known for this disease , identification of potential therapeutic targets is of immense importance . In this paper , we carry out a comprehensive dynamical and structural analysis of a network model of this disease . By employing a network reduction technique , we identify the stationary states ( fixed points ) of the system , representing normal and diseased ( T-LGL ) behavior , and analyze their precursor states ( basins of attraction ) using an asynchronous Boolean dynamic framework . This analysis identifies the T-LGL states of 54 components of the network . The predicted state of one of these components ( SMAD ) is validated by new wet-bench experiments . We then perform node perturbation analysis using the dynamic approach and a structural method proposed in [23] to study to what extent does each component contribute to T-LGL leukemia . Both methods give consistent results and together identify 19 key components whose disruption can reverse the abnormal state of the signaling network , thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets for this disease , some of which are also corroborated by experimental evidence . By deciphering the structure and dynamics of the underlying network , we reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk as compared to Arabidopsis . Our results provide valuable guidance for wet-bench experiments and for the design of intervention strategies for T-LGL leukemia .
 The study of chromosome folding is a challenging task due to the large size and complexity of chromosomes. In this study, we propose a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Our approach accounts for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, and allows for a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency. We apply our strategy to investigate the dynamics of chromosome folding in drosophila during one cell cycle. We show that our coarse-grained null model accurately captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system, and predicts that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle. Our results suggest that topological constraints generated by polymer entanglement play an essential role in controlling the dynamics and fluctuations of chromosomes.
 Toxoplasma gondii is a globally distributed protozoan parasite that causes a variety of diseases in humans and animals. The parasite is transmitted via oocysts that are shed by infected cats and ingested by rodents, which are then transmitted to humans. The parasite is highly adapted to its environment and has a complex life cycle that involves multiple hosts. The parasite is also highly virulent and can cause severe disease in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The parasite is also highly resistant to antibiotics and other drugs, making it difficult to treat. Recent studies have shown that the parasite is highly dependent on host lipids for its survival and replication. The parasite has evolved a number of mechanisms to acquire and utilize host lipids, including the formation of lipid droplets (LD) in the host cell. The parasite also has the ability to scavenge host LD for its own use, which may contribute to its ability to survive and replicate in the host cell. Understanding the mechanisms by which the parasite acquires and utilizes host lipids may lead to the development of new drugs or other interventions that can be used to treat or prevent toxoplasmosis.
 The Hippo signaling pathway is a conserved pathway that regulates organ size and tissue homeostasis in animals. In Drosophila, the Hippo pathway is composed of a kinase cascade that includes the kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, and the transcriptional co-activator YAP/TAZ. The pathway is regulated by the upstream kinase MOB1, which is required for proper Hippo signaling. In this study, the authors identified a new component of the Hippo signaling pathway in Drosophila, which they named AtMOB1A. They showed that AtMOB1A is required for proper Hippo signaling and that it interacts with the kinase MST1/2. The authors also demonstrated that AtMOB1A is required for proper development of Drosophila embryos and that it regulates the expression of genes involved in organ size control. These findings provide new insights into the Hippo signaling pathway and its role in development.

 The thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complexes are important for the function of Trx and its substrates. The dissociation mechanism of Trx mixed disulfide complexes is unknown and has been debated for more than twenty years. Specifically, opposing arguments for the activation of the nucleophilic cysteine as a thiolate during the dissociation of the complex have been put forward. As a key model, the complex between Trx and its endogenous substrate, arsenate reductase (ArsC), was used. In this structure, a Cys29Trx-Cys89ArsC intermediate disulfide is formed by the nucleophilic attack of Cys29Trx on the exposed Cys82ArsC-Cys89ArsC in oxidized ArsC. With theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants, Trx mixed disulfide complex dissociation was studied. We observed that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx. Cys32Trx is activated for its nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds, and Cys32Trx directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx and not on Cys89ArsC. This multidisciplinary approach provides fresh insights into a universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism that results in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx.
 Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterrium leprae and M. lepromatosis that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system , later reaching other organs and systems [7 , 8] . After being exposed to the pathogen , most of the individuals present resistance to infection . Those who develop the disease can fit within a broad clinical spectrum with two antagonistic poles , from paucibacillary tuberculoid to multibacillary lepromatous disease [9] . This clinical diversity relies on the quality of the immune response , which itself results from genetic variants of the host and environmental factors [10] . Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) , all done with the Chinese population , identified polymorphisms in interleukin 23 receptor ( IL23R ) , nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 ( NOD2 ) and human leukocyte antigens–antigen D related ( HLA-DR ) genes as associated with susceptibility to the disease [11–14] . In addition , polymorphisms of genes associated with Parkinson ( Parkin—PAK2 , parkin coregulated—PACRG and superoxide dismutase 2 -SOD2 ) and Alzheimer diseases ( SOD2 ) modulate susceptibility to leprosy in independent populations [15 , 16] . The complement system includes 47 proteins and protein fragments that activate , coordinate and regulate a proinflammatory , proteolytic cascade of the immune response [17] . Altered expression and functional deficiency of complement components modulate susceptibility to diseases . Genetic variants that reduce complement activation or complement-mediated recognition of opsonized elements may enhance resistance against pathogens that depend on phagocytosis to initiate infection , as mycobacteria . They may also decrease inflammation at skin and nerve injuries [18 , 19] . Indeed , several polymorphisms of genes of the complement system are associated with leprosy: mannose-binding lectin ( MBL2 ) , ficolins ( FCN1 , FCN2 and FCN3 ) , the serine protease associated with them ( MASP2—mannose-binding lectin serine protease 2 ) and complement receptor 1 ( CR1 , also known as CD35 ) [10 , 20–24] . The entrance of mycobacteria into macrophages is mediated by complement receptors such as CR1 , which binds C3b/C4b complement fragments deposited on opsonized bacteria [25] . CR1 is mainly expressed by erythrocytes , phagocytes , B and T cells , in membrane-bound or soluble form [26] . It accelerates the decay of C3 and C5 convertases and serves as a cofactor in factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b/C4b into ligands for other complement receptors [27] . In addition , CR1 competes with MASPs for the same binding sites on collectins and ficolins , which initiate the lectin pathway of complement . These molecules possibly act as opsonins , leading to CR1-mediated internalization of pathogens into phagocytes [28] . In malaria , CR1 generates rosettes between Plasmodium falciparum infected and noninfected erythrocytes and mediates sialic acid–independent cell invasion [29 , 30] . Despite this multitude of functions , genetic association studies of infectious diseases with CR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) are scarce [20 , 31] , and only one investigated this gene in leprosy , reporting a protective association with the McCoyb allele ( rs17047660 ) in a rural region of Malawi [20] . In this work , we aim to fill in this gap by investigating CR1 polymorphisms , mRNA expression levels and sCR1 serum levels in Brazilian leprosy patients .

 The study aimed to identify functionally associated genes important for coronary artery disease ( CAD ) using whole-genome expression profiles from multiple organs. The first step of the two-way clustering approach processed all mRNA signals within one organ to define a number of tissue clusters. The second step clustered the patients according to the mRNA signals within each tissue cluster to identify signals related to clinical phenotypes. The clinical endpoint was the extent of coronary atherosclerotic lesions as judged from the degree of coronary stenosis, measured by quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ). A secondary hypothesis was to reveal the extent to which any tissue cluster related to coronary stenosis acts in isolation in one organ or across several organs. The multi-organ biopsy approach is primarily motivated by the nature of CAD development: atherosclerotic diseases are believed to start in adolescence and develop throughout life. Metabolic disturbances (e.g., overweight, diabetes, and dyslipidemias) that originate in organs central to energy metabolism (e.g., liver, skeletal muscle, and fat deposits) are likely to influence the progression and extent of coronary atherosclerosis. The STAGE study comprises 114 carefully characterized patients, including a compendium of 278 global gene-expression profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues isolated during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Using a two-way clustering approach, we analyzed this compendium to test our main hypothesis that there are groups of functionally associated genes (rather than individual genes) of importance for CAD and to determine whether those groups of genes act in isolation in each tissue or across several tissues.
 In this study , we investigated the mechanism by which cardiac alternans in a single cell spontaneously evolves into re-entrant arrhythmias in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cardiac tissues . Our results demonstrated that re-entry is driven by a combination of APD and CV restitution properties with the curvature-dependence of CV . Tissue inhomogeneity and anisotropy further promoted break-up of excitation waves , leading to multiple re-entrant excitation waves . It was also found that impaired sodium channel with either increased or decreased channel current facilitated the arrhythmogenesis . This study provides new insights into the underlying mechanism of cardiac alternans and arrhythmias , which may be of potential clinical relevance . Similar results were observed in human atrial tissue models , suggesting our major findings are model-independent and of potential clinical relevance .

 ' Papillomavuses ( HPVs ) are small , non-enveloped , double stranded DNA viruses that infect the cutaneous and/or mucosal epithelium in many vertebrates [1] . Over 100 human papillomavirus ( HPV ) genottypes are categorized as high risk ( HPV16 and HPV18 ) or low risk ( HPV6 and HPV11 ) depending on their oncogenicity . High risk genottypes are causally associated with anogenital cancers including nearly 100% of cervical carcinomas , the second leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide [1]–[3] . HPV is also associated with ∼25% of head and neck cancers , the sixth most common cancer in the United States [4] , [5] . The HPV life cycle is tightly linked to the differentiation of its host epithelial cells [6] , [7] . This complex life cycle includes a ) infection and establishment of the viral DNA as a multicopy nuclear plasmid , which only occurs in dividing basal cells of stratified epithelium; b ) maintenance of the viral DNA at low copy number in dividing basal epithelial cells; and c ) high copy number DNA amplification and encapsidation in non-dividing , terminally differentiated epithelial cells to yield progeny virions . The mechanisms controlling this life cycle , particularly the restriction of HPV infection and DNA establishment to dividing basal cells , are not well understood . The tight link between keratinocyte differentiation and the HPV life cycle has made large scale production of mature infectious HPV particles difficult , greatly restricting studies of the mechanisms of natural HPV infection [8] , [9] . Recently developed transfection methods that generate large yields of virus particles and efficient encapsidation of target plasmids as large as the full length ∼8 kb HPV genome have overcome this limitation [10 , 11] . This technique provides a genetically modifiable , high yield source of infectious HPV and HPV pseudoviruses expressing reporter genes for studies of different early steps of HPV infection including virion binding , endocytosis , uncoating of the virion capsid , release from the endosome , trafficking to the nucleus , and delivery of viral DNA to the nucleus , and transcription of encapsidated genes . To define the pathways and mechanisms involved in these early steps of HPV infection , we tested approximately 5 , 000 bioactive compounds with known mechanisms of action for effects on the entry of HPV capsids containing reporter genes or the full HPV genome , and identified a subset of cell cycle inhibitors that completely blocked wild type HPV infection . Our further studies showed that cell cycle progression through early stages of mitosis is critical for successful HPV infection . These findings reveal new insights into the mechanism by which HPV infects cells and provide one reason why HPV infects only undifferentiated , proliferating cells . These results also provide new leads for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies against HPV infection .'; Abstract: ' Papillomavuses ( HPVs ) are small , non-enveloped , double stranded DNA viruses that infect the cutaneous and/or mucosal epithelium in many vertebrates [1] .

 The study of the genetic diversity of Leishmania parasites is important for understanding the evolution of the parasite and its ability to adapt to different environments. The authors used MALDI-TOF MS to analyze the genetic diversity of Leishmania parasites from different geographic regions. They found that the parasites from Southeast Asia were more genetically diverse than those from other regions, possibly due to clonal expansion following intensified control efforts after the emergence of artemisinin resistance. The authors also identified loci under positive selection in multiple countries throughout Southeast Asia and Africa, where the selection pressure is currently unknown. They found that the selection pressure at one of these loci has originated from gene flow, while the other loci have originated from multiple independent events. The authors suggest that the selection pressure at these loci could be used as a marker for the evolution of Leishmania parasites in different regions.
 The study by Kramer et al. provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the anti-filarial effects of Wolbachia depletion in filarial nematodes. The authors used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the consequences of Wolbachia depletion on host nematode cellular and nuclear structure. They found that Wolbachia depletion leads to extensive apoptosis in germline cells and embryos, which occurs soon after bacterial depletion in B. malayi and is sustained for at least 21 months in O. volvulus. The authors also observed disruption of cytoskeleton arrangement in the lateral chord cells, where the vast majority of the bacteria reside. These findings provide a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes. The study provides important new information that may help in the development of more effective treatments for filarial diseases.
 This study aimed to characterize the dynamic lipidomic profile in the brain during acute, subacute, and chronic neurotoxocarosis (NT) in Toxocara canis- and Toxocara cati-infected mice as a model for paratenic hosts. The infection was predominantly characterized by only minor changes in the pattern of pro-inflammatory oxylipins, while anti-inflammatory metabolites, derived from lipoxygenase pathways, were significantly elevated in the subacute phase as well as in the beginning of the chronic phase of infection. This trend was also reflected in the 13-HODE/9-HODE ratio, a biomarker for the immunological status of an active infection. Obtained data provide a valuable insight in the host’s immune reaction as response against neuroinvasive Toxocara spp.-larvae, contributing to the characterisation of the mostly unknown pathogenesis of NT.

 The development of an HIV-1 vaccine that stimulates the production of antibodies capable of neutralizing diverse circulating HIV-1 strains remains a global priority. Studies have shown that broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bNAbs ) isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals can protect against infection in non-human primates and, in some cases, reduce viremia after already established infection. An intriguing feature of one class of bNAbs directed against the primary receptor binding site ( CD4bs ) is that they are encoded by the same heavy chain gene segment, which encodes critical contacts for this class of Ab. Here, we asked if HIV-1 Env vaccination activates B cells that encode the rhesus macaque orthologue of this gene segment and if so what the genetic and structural properties of such antibodies are. We isolated a set of monoclonal antibodies encoded by this gene segment and demonstrate that one such Ab, GE356 , binds the receptor binding site in a manner that is distinctly different from the mode of interaction of CD4bs-directed bNAbs. These results provide a possible explanation for the lack of broadly neutralizing activity following vaccination, even when antibodies encoded by gene segments frequently used in bNAbs are elicited.
 In this study, we report on the use of rhodamine B as a dual marking technique for male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Rhodamine B is a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye that produces a bright red colour when fluoresced. It is easily applied and detected with or without inexpensive UV lights. We assessed the optimal feeding regimes for ideal body and seminal fluid marking, as well as any potential impacts of rhodamine B feeding on male survival and mating competitiveness. We conclude by presenting results from proof-of-principle field releases. Our results suggest that rhodamine B marking is a useful technique for assessing male mating success and could be used in male-based sterile insect technique ( SIT ) and incompatible insect technique ( IIT ) control programs.
 The authors present a study on the role of Boophilin, a protease inhibitor expressed in the midgut of ticks, in thrombosis inhibition. The authors demonstrate that Boophilin is a non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein, and that it blocks platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in vitro. The authors also show that Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion in vivo triggered by FeCl3 and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method. The authors conclude that Boophilin plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment at low hemostatic and inflammatory tonus, which allows ticks to successfully digest a blood meal. The authors suggest that Boophilin could be used as a therapeutic agent for thrombosis inhibition.
 The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma disease compared to mass drug administration (MDA) in four endemic populations in West and East Africa. The study used a mathematical model of transmission to compare the two approaches and previously published data on the costs of these interventions. The study found that targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma disease was as effective as MDA in reducing infection and was more cost-effective when antibiotics were not donated. The study also found that targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma disease was more cost-effective than MDA if it increased the proportion of infected individuals receiving treatment. The study suggests that targeting antibiotics to households with active trachoma disease has the potential to be a cost-effective trachoma control measure, but further work is required to assess if costs can be reduced and to what extent the approach can increase the treatment coverage of infected individuals compared to MDA in different settings.
 The fungus Candida albicans is a commensal and opportunistic pathogen that undergoes a morphological switch from yeast to hyphal form during tissue invasion. The molecular mechanisms underlying this switch are not well understood. We have identified the forkhead transcription factor Fkh2 as a novel target of phosphorylation during the morphological switch. We show that Fkh2 is phosphorylated by two kinases, Cdc28-Cln3 and Cbk1-Mob2, in a hyphal-specific manner. The phosphorylation of Fkh2 is required for the expression of hyphal-specific genes involved in pathogenesis. Our findings suggest a novel regulatory circuit that controls the expression of hyphal-specific genes during tissue invasion.
 The study of the molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress has been limited by the lack of a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to visualize the final steps in PRV particle transport and exocytosis. To address this, the authors developed a method that uses total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to selectively image PRV particles near the plasma membrane and a pH-sensitive fluorescent probe to reveal the precise moment and location of exocytosis. They found that PRV particles are tightly confined at the plasma membrane before and after exocytosis and undergo a sharp movement during the tens of milliseconds immediately after pHluorin dequenching. They also found that viral exocytosis events occur most frequently near plasma membrane patches of LL5β, part of a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane and regulates exocytosis. Based on these findings and previous reports in the cell biological and alpha herpesvirus literature, the authors propose an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress.
 Influenza is a major public health concern, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The variants of influenza virus have caused substantial morbidity and mortality. To assess the impact of influenza virus on human death, investigators usually rely on surveillance data to estimate its case fatality ratio (CFR) and the excess mortality it causes. However, accurate prediction of the influenza mortality burden at the early stage of influenza infection is challenging because the data for early influenza surveillance are limited and prone to bias. In this study, we describe our work on how to establish a positive correlation between the antigenic variation of human influenza virus and the total excess mortality it causes during all periods of its circulation. The established relationship has enabled us to develop a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between A (H1N1) strains based on their HA sequences. Our method can provide valuable information for public preparedness for an impending epidemic/pandemic and for the health authorities to develop cost-effective control and intervention strategies.
 We developed a method for estimating local ancestry ( LA ) in pooled sequencing data from admixed populations of Leishmania parasites . Our method is based on , and extends , to accommodate pooled sequencing data and to estimate the time since admixture within a population .

 The study presents the structure of dissociated pentamers of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and an icosahedral assembly of these pentamers, which have associated with the reverse curvature to their normal organisation in the mature virus. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of isolated pentamers formed by the acid treatment of infectious, native FMDV particles and in addition have captured an icosahedral assembly of these pentamers, which have associated with the reverse curvature to their normal organisation in the mature virus. The authors found that the structures of ordered portions of both isolated and assembled pentamers are generally very similar not only to each other but also to the corresponding regions of the mature capsid although a small rotation in VP3 has occurred on dissociation of the pentamer. The authors also found that the formation of regular assemblies rather than random aggregates has enabled them to solve the structure to relatively high resolution using cryo-EM. Overall there are remarkably few large-scale conformational changes in the dis-assembled pentamer from its structure in the intact virus, suggesting that the mature virus pentamer is essentially a stable endpoint. The authors also used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of the SjIRs in adult schistosomes in vitro and show that, in addition to their reduced transcription, the transcript levels of other important downstream genes within the insulin pathway, associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity, were also impacted substantially. In vaccine/challenge experiments, the authors found that rSjLD1 and rSjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These data re-emphasize the potential of the SjIRs as veterinary transmission blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines.
 The present study aimed to investigate the role of Nef in HIV-1 virion infectivity. The authors found that Nef conferred as much as 50-fold resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, two potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( nAbs ) that target the membrane proximal external region ( MPER ) of TMgp41. In contrast, Nef had no effect on HIV-1 neutralization by MPER-specific nAb Z13e1, by the peptide inhibitor T20, nor by a panel of nAbs and other reagents targeting gp120. Resistance to neutralization by 2F5 and 4E10 was observed with Nef from a diverse range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. Functional analysis of a panel of Nef mutants revealed that this activity requires Nef myristoylation but that it is genetically separable from other Nef functions such as the ability to enhance virus infectivity and to downregulate CD4. Glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV substituted for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. The authors conclude that Nef protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies. This newly discovered activity for Nef has important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
 The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the messenger RNA using a DNA template. Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains elusive whether the “secondary channel” is the only route for NTP to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the “main channel” could be an alternative. On this regard, crystallographic structures of Pol II have been extremely useful to understand the structural basis of transcription, however, the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the full transcription bubble (TB) is still unknown. Since diffusion routes of the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate through the main channel might overlap with the TB region, gaining structural information of the full TB is critical for a complete understanding of Pol II transcription process. In this study, we have built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations together with structural analysis to shed light on NTP entry pathways. Interestingly, we found that although both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on MD simulations with NTP loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the NTP through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription.
 This study presents the first structure of dissociated pentamers from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and an icosahedral assembly of these pentamers. The structure reveals that the pentamers dissociate into an 'inside-out' configuration, with VP3 rotated relative to its position in the mature virus. This change in conformation is associated with a loss of antigenic surface and a change in the ability of the virus to penetrate host cells. The study provides insights into the mechanism of virus disassembly and the role of VP3 in the process.
 The study of the crystal structure of LlpABW, a novel family of antibacterial proteins, has revealed a unique architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains. The N-domain is structurally more divergent and lacks a functional mannose-binding site, while the C-domain adopts a fold very similar to MMBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides. Mutational analysis has indicated that an intact sugar-binding pocket in the C-domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-domain determines target specificity, while the C-domain is responsible for bacteriotoxicity. The study has provided insights into the evolutionary origins of LlpABW and its unique features, which distinguish it from other MMBL proteins.
 We find that the GC-content of most bacterial species is not consistent with mutation bias alone . We show that the GC-content of many bacterial species is influenced by a number of factors including genome size , whether the bacterium is free-living or not , [9] , [10] , the environment [11] , aerobiosis [12] , nitrogen utilization [13] and possibly temperature [14] ( but see [15]–[17] ) . However , it is still unknown whether these correlations are due to the influence of these factors on the process of mutation , or whether natural selection is involved . For a few bacteria there is evidence that the genomic GC-content is not a simple consequence of mutation bias . The mutation pattern has been directly measured in Escherichia coli and found to be AT-biased [18] , [19] . If the genomic GC-content was simply determined by mutation bias it would be expected to decline from its current value of 0 . 5 to 0 . 32 [20] . The fact that the genomic GC-content is higher than this value can be explained by functional constraints . However , even sites that appear to be under little selection , such as synonymous sites in lowly expressed genes , have a GC-content of ∼57% [21] , which is considerably above the equilibrium inferred from the mutation studies . Of course , it is likely that the mutation pattern measured in the laboratory is not identical to that experienced by the bacterium in the wild . However , a phylogenetic analysis of substitutions between closely related E . coli strains also shows the same tendency for an excess of GC→AT mutations [22] . Furthermore this bias towards GC→AT substitutions is less acute amongst common polymorphisms , consistent with natural selection acting against GC→AT mutations [22] . A similar excess of GC→AT substitutions is seen in the pseudogenes between strains of Mycobacterrium leprae [23] , again suggesting that the mutation pattern is AT biased relative to the current genomic GC-content , and that it will , given the opportunity , decrease the GC-content [20] . However , M . leprae is an intra-cellular parasite and this has led to the loss of many genes; it is possible that one of these is a DNA repair enzyme that has shifted the mutation bias towards being AT-rich . Here we test whether genomic GC-content is a simple consequence of mutation bias by investigating the pattern of synonymous genetic variation in 149 bacterial species . We find that the GC-content of most bacterial species is not consistent with mutation bias alone .

 The study presents a detailed characterization of a large deletion polymorphism in the GSTT2B gene, which is located in a complex genomic region with a 61 kb inverted repeat. The deletion is found in 66% of the CEU population and is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the neighboring GSTT1 deletion polymorphism. The study shows that the deletion has a strong influence on the expression of the remaining GSTT2 gene, leading to a potentially null allele at GSTT2. The study also shows that the deletion is not random, as it is found in 90% of the HapMap population. The study provides a detailed characterization of the complex genomic region, including the identification of a novel microhomology-based mechanism for the deletion. The study also provides evidence for the role of transcription in somatic CAG instability in vivo, as the study shows that transcription elongation mediates tissue-specific somatic CAG instability in HD. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the complex genomic region and its influence on gene expression and disease association.
 The study aimed to identify and map existing NTD research outputs and processes within Germany and with its partners abroad to enable informed, evidence-driven policy making that addresses the needs of patients with NTDs. The study used bibliometric data from published research on kinetoplastid and helminth diseases between 2002 and 2012 to construct co-author networks. The study found that the majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil, and collaborations with partners on the African continent remained scattered. The study identified strong performers on an individual level by using classic parameters (number of publications, h-index) and social network analysis parameters (betweenness centrality). The study concluded that the research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases, and the share of NTD publications with German affiliations was approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. The study suggested that identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators and could facilitate data-driven health policies. The study contributed to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.

 'We hypothesised that people can be uncertain about their tastes . Personal tastes are therefore uncertain beliefs . People can thus learn about them by considering evidence , such as the preferences of relevant others , and then performing Bayesian updating . If a person’s choice variability reflects uncertainty , as in random-preference models , then a signature of Bayesian updating is that the degree of taste change should correlate with that person’s choice variability . Temporal discounting coefficients are an important example of taste–for patience . These coefficients quantify impulsivity , have good psychometric properties and can change upon observing others’ choices . We examined discounting preferences in a novel , large community study of 14–24 year olds . We assessed discounting behaviour , including decision variability , before and after participants observed another person’s choices . We found good evidence for taste uncertainty and for Bayesian taste updating . First , participants displayed decision variability which was better accounted for by a random-taste than by a response-noise model . Second , apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model taking into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information . Our findings have important neuroscientific , clinical and developmental significance . ', Introduction: ' The study of the neural circuits of the nemu ( nemu , new neurrologon ) has revealed that the Snail-related transcription factor CES-1 plays a crucial role in the coordination of cell proliferation and cell fate determination in the NSM lineage . In the NSM lineage , CES-1 is required for the asymmetric division of the NSM neuroblast along the ventral-lateral dorsal-medial axis , which is the axis along which the NSM neuroblast divides into two daughter cells of different sizes and different fates , the larger NSM neuroblast that survives and differentiates into a seratonergic neuro-secretory motorneuron ( NSM ) and the smaller NSM sister cell that undergoes apoptosis and forms a cell corpse .

 Rice is an important monocotyledonous crop worldwide; it differs from the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis in many aspects . In Arabidopsis , ethylene and auxin act synergistically to regulate root growth and development . However , their interaction in rice is still unclear . In this study , multiscale rabbit ventricular computational models were used to address this issue by investigating the underlying mechanism ( s ) for the arrhythmogenesis of cardiac alternans , as well as a possible role of sodium channel on perpetuating cardiac arrhythmias . Our results demonstrated a spontaneous development of re-entry from cellular alternans , arising from a combined action of APD and CV restitution properties with the curvature-dependence of CV . Tissue inhomogeneity and anisotropy further promoted break-up of excitation waves , leading to multiple re-entrant excitation waves . It was also found impaired sodium channel with either increased or decreased channel current facilitated the arrhythmogenesis . This study provides new insights into underlying the mechanism , by which cellular cardiac alternans spontaneously evolves into cardiac arrhythmias . Similar results were observed in human atrial tissue models , suggesting our major findings are model-independent and of potential clinical relevance .
 The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is upregulated in cancer tissues and its elevated expression is associated with hyper-proliferation , but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood . We demonstrate that MALAT1 levels are regulated during normal cell cycle progression . Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in normal human diploid fibroblasts reveal that MALAT1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression . Depletion of MALAT1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes . The cell cycle defects observed in MALAT1-depleted cells are sensitive to the cellular levels of p53 , indicating that p53 is a major downstream mediator of MALAT1 activity . Furthermore , MALAT1-depleted cells display reduced expression of B-MYB ( Mybl2 ) , an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression , due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing . In human cells , MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of oncogenic transcription factors . These findings provide mechanistic insights on the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation .
 The majority of HIV-1 infections in women occur through vaginal intercourse, in which virus-containing semen is deposited on the cervico-vaginal mucosa. Semen is more than a mere carrier of HIV-1, since it contains many biological factors, in particular cytokines, that may affect HIV-1 transmission. The concentration of interleukin (IL)-7, one of the most prominent cytokines in semen of healthy individuals, is further increased in semen of HIV-1-infected men. Here, we investigated the potential role of IL-7 in HIV-1 vaginal transmission in an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue. We simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue in combination with IL-7 at concentrations comparable with those measured in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. We found that IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue. Similarly, we observed an enhancement of HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues showed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion preventing apoptosis, as shown by the decrease in the number of cells expressing the apoptotic marker APO2. 7 and the increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Also, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells, as evidenced by staining for the nuclear factor Ki-67. High levels of seminal IL-7 in vivo may be relevant to the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection.
 The evolutionary origins of genetic robustness are still under debate. We use a computational model to study the influence of environmental robustness on metabolic network structure. We find that environmental robustness is a key determinant of metabolic network structure, and that it has evolved as a byproduct of natural selection in favor of increased metabolic flux. We also find that dispensability is not a directly selected feature, but rather a byproduct of the optimization of other traits. Our model predicts that dispensability is a species-specific feature, and that it is not a universal trait. We conclude that the evolution of genetic robustness is a complex process that is shaped by multiple factors, including environmental robustness, intrinsic robustness, and natural selection for other traits. Our model provides a new framework for studying the evolution of metabolic networks and their associated traits.
 The Leishmania arginase gene is differentially expressed in promastigotes and axenic amastigotes. The transcriptional profiling of La-WT and La-arg- promastigotes and axenic amastigotes revealed 8253 transcripts, 60% encoding hypothetical proteins and 443 novel transcripts. The transcriptional profiling also revealed that 85% of the genes were constitutively expressed. Among the 15% (1268 genes) of the differentially expressed genes, we identified genes up- and down-regulated comparing the transcript abundance from different life cycle stages of the parasite and in the presence or absence of arginase. We also combined the transcriptional with metabolic profile that revealed a proportional correlation between enzyme and metabolites in the polyamine pathway. The differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes alters the expression of enzymes from polyamines biosynthesis, which modulates ornithine, L-glutamate, proline and putrescine levels. In addition, the absence of arginase activity increased the levels of L-arginine, citrulline and L-glutamate and decreased the levels of aspartate, proline, ornithine and putrescine in promastigotes by differential modulation of genes involved in its metabolism. Altogether these data provided additional insights into how Leishmania is able to modulate its biological functions in the presence or absence of arginase activity to survive during environmental changes.
 Vaccines are the best and most cost-effective defense against many infectious diseases . However , the optimal inoculum dose for a vaccine is often difficult to determine . Here , we develop a conceptual , quantitative modeling framework that might allow us to predict the optimal inoculum dose for a given vaccine and setting . We use data from two infection experiments , namely influenza A virus ( IAV ) and human parainfluenza virus ( HPIV ) . We also investigate a scenario for an inactivated vaccine . Influenza A virus remains a serious health concern . While a vaccine exists , it needs to be reformulated regularly . Even when the vaccine is well-matched to the circulating strain , its efficacy is not as good as that of other vaccines , especially in the elderly . It has been suggested that using a higher inoculum dose in vaccines for this population might be beneficial [19] . Development of a better vaccine that remains protective in the presence of antigenic drift and that has a higher efficacy remains a priority . Human parainfluenza virus ( HPIV ) is an important cause of lower respiratory tract illness in children [20–24] . There is currently no licensed vaccine available against HPIV [11 , 21 , 24] , despite various attempts to develop such a vaccine [25] . While the two pathogens we analyze here are important , the fact that the data we use comes from animal studies means are results are not directly applicable to possible human vaccines . We consider the important contribution of this study to be the development of a conceptual , quantitative framework that may be used to rationally design vaccines and determine an optimal inoculum dose for any pathogen .
 The study of DNA methylation patterns in cancer has been limited by the lack of a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of methylation changes at single base-pair resolution. Here, the authors used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to establish genome-wide methylation maps from normal lung tissue, from Dnmt3a wildtype tumors, and from Dnmt3a knockout tumors. Their results uncover a novel function of this de novo methyltransferase in cancer, as Dnmt3a deficiency results in loss of methylation in large active chromatin domains. This study provides a detailed and quantitative analysis of DNA methylation changes in cancer, which may help to understand the role of Dnmt3a in cancer progression and to identify new targets for cancer therapy.
 The PR interval is a key parameter in the cyclic life of hair forehrrs ( HF-SCs ) , which is a crucial prarihry hrfhrr . The PR interval is a measure of the duration of the anaerronic hrfhrr , which is a critical parameter for the activation of HF-SCs . The PR interval is a risk factor for arrhythmia and is associated with genetic variants . We performed a GWA study in African Americans to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration . We found nine loci associated with PR interval duration in African Americans . These loci were replicated in European and Asian populations . However , there is a general paucity of GWA studies performed in African populations . We recommend that policy makers consider implementing the PR IHRF protocol in African populations . The protocol would require a multifactoral approach to address the challenges of genetic variants and LD . We also recommend that future studies focus on African populations to identify novel alleles and genetic variants associated with PR IHF protocols . These findings might have translational implications for the development of novel antiarrrhias and cancer treatments .
 In this study, we investigated the role of two different inhibitory motifs, feed-forward ( FF ) and feedback ( FB ), in the regulation of sparse firing of Kenyon cells ( KCs ) in the mushroom body ( MB ) of the locust. We developed two computational models of the MB circuitry, one implementing FF inhibition and the other implementing FB inhibition. Our results showed that FB inhibition was more effective in creating sparse firing patterns than FF inhibition. We also found that FB inhibition was more effective in reducing interference between memory traces than FF inhibition. These findings suggest that FB inhibition may be more important for memory and learning in the MB of the locust.
 The BRCA Challenge is a global initiative to develop a comprehensive, standardized, and secure system for sharing and curating data on BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. The BRCA Challenge is a collaboration between academic researchers , clinical laboratories , and patient advocacy groups to develop a web-based platform for variant annotation and sharing of data from multiple sources. The BRCA Challenge is a Driver Project of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ( GA4GH ) and is supported by the European Union’s Horareurope program. The BRCA Challenge is a model for data sharing and curation across genes and regulatory regions of major clinical importance . The BRCA Challenge is a collaboration between clinicians , researchers , data scientists , patients , and advocates to work toward a new model of data sharing . Its purpose is to create a comprehensive data-sharing and curation system that could be easily applied to the more than 114 other cancer predisposition genes identified to date [46] , and ultimately , to all genes underlying recognized disease phenotypes , currently estimated to be around 3 , 000 . In conclusion , the BRCA Challenge is a model for systematically engaging broad communities and resources for sharing data across genes and eventually regulatory regions of major clinical importance .
 The RAS/MAPK pathway is a major signaling cascade that plays a central role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In this study, the authors conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify novel factors that regulate RAS/MAPK signaling. They identified 101 hits, including 55 novel factors that act at different steps along the pathway. The majority of these novel factors were found to act downstream of MEK and to regulate MAPK expression. The authors also found that most of the novel factors were associated with mRNA processing and were found to regulate mapk splicing. They discovered that the impact of these factors on alternative splicing (AS) of mapk differs from what they previously described for the EJC, indicating that two different types of regulatory input act on this step in mapk expression. The authors conclude that in addition to post-translational regulatory events, such as those controlling RAF activation, pathway output is also tightly governed by the regulation of the expression of core components. In particular, the expression of MAPK emerges as a focal point for multiple different regulatory inputs.
 The study of the genetic diversity of pathogens is important for understanding the evolution of infectious diseases and for informing outbreak control strategies. However, the genetic diversity of pathogens can vary greatly depending on the pathogen and the transmission dynamics of the outbreak. In this study, we introduce the concept of "transmission divergence" to quantify the genetic diversity of pathogens. We use simulation to estimate the transmission divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens, including Ebola virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza A, MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Clostridium difficile. We compare estimates of transmission divergence under different models, including the outbreaker model and the phybreak model. We also illustrate the impact of transmission divergence on our ability to infer transmission trees using the outbreaker and phybreak inference algorithms for the R software. Our results show that transmission divergence varies greatly among pathogens and can have a significant impact on our ability to infer transmission trees.
 We studied the immune responses of pre-infection PBMCs to DENV-1 stimulation in vitro using a multiplexed cytokine immunoassay. We found that the cytokine profiles of PBMCs from subjects who later developed symptomatic DENV infection were significantly different from those of subjects who developed subclinical infection. Specifically, we found that PBMCs from symptomatic infection subjects produced significantly higher levels of IL-15, MCP-1, and IL-6, whereas PBMCs from subclinical infection subjects produced significantly higher levels of IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα. These results suggest that pre-existing immune profiles may be useful for predicting the clinical outcome of subsequent DENV infection.
