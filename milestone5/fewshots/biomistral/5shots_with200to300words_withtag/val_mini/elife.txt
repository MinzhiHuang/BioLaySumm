 'The brain is made up of many different parts that work together to help us think, feel, and move. These parts are connected by tiny electrical signals called neurons. As we grow up, these neurons form connections with each other that help us learn new things and remember what we have learned. Scientists have been studying how these connections form and change over time. They have found that the connections between neurons change a lot during the first few weeks of life. They also found that these changes happen in a specific order. They think that this order is important for helping us learn new things later in life. To study these changes, scientists used special equipment to measure the electrical signals between neurons in the brains of mice and humans. They found that the connections between neurons change a lot during the first few weeks of life. They also found that these changes happen in a specific order. They think that this order is important for helping us learn new things later in life.'
 'Many decisions are thought to arise via the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. In perception, the mechanism explains the effect of stimulus strength, characterized by signal-to-noise ratio, on decision speed, accuracy, and confidence. An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and, paradoxically, higher confidence. To test these predictions, we introduced a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex, which we verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. For both humans and monkeys, increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model. The findings suggest that noise plays a crucial role in decision-making and that the brain may actively manipulate noise to optimize decision performance.'
 'OCRL is a protein that helps cells sort and recycle materials. Mutations in OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease, which are characterized by cognitive disabilities and developmental delay. Researchers found that OCRL is important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process that helps cells take in materials from their environment. They also found that OCRL helps to uncoat clathrin-coated vesicles, which are important for the progression of endocytosis. These findings suggest that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis may contribute to the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.'
 'In animals, the growth and development of tissues and organs is controlled by a variety of signaling molecules that move from their source to target cells. These molecules can form gradients that help to shape the tissues and organs in specific ways. However, the mechanisms by which these gradients are formed are not well understood. In this study, the authors used the fruit fly Drosophila to investigate how a signaling molecule called Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) forms a gradient. They found that FGF moves from the source to the target cells through specialized filopodia called cytonemes. These cytonemes help to create a gradient by allowing FGF to move directly from the source to the target cells, rather than diffusing through the extracellular space. The authors also found that the gradient is self-regulated by the cytonemes, which can change their length and number in response to changes in the concentration of FGF. This helps to ensure that the gradient is maintained at the right level and shape. Overall, this study provides important insights into how signaling molecules can form precise gradients that help to shape tissues and organs during development.'
 'A new study has used genome-wide analysis to characterise the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups. The study found that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. In fact, most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. The study provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. The study also highlights the importance of considering the historical context of genetic diversity when interpreting genotype-phenotype associations in Africa.'
 ' Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a common human virus that can cause several types of cancer. EBV expresses viral oncoproteins that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis. The viral oncoprotein LMP1 is critical for the survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection, B cells proliferate rapidly with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. In this study, the authors used BH3 profiling to investigate the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection. They found that early-infected cells rely on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.'
 'Transcription is the process by which cells make copies of DNA into RNA. This process involves a number of steps, including the recruitment of enzymes and other proteins to the DNA. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a key player in this process. It is a long, disordered region that is composed of repeating units of the sequence YSPTSPS. These repeats can be modified in a number of ways, including by phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation. In this study, the authors describe a new type of modification called methylation of lysine 7 (K7me1 and K7me2) in the CTD of RNAPII. They found that this modification occurs at the earliest stages of transcription and is associated with productive elongation. They also found that the balance between K7 methylation and acetylation is important for regulating gene expression levels. The authors used a combination of biochemical and genomic approaches to make these discoveries. Their findings provide new insights into the complex process of transcription and may help us better understand how genes are regulated in cells. '
 'Swi2/Snf2 ATPases are proteins that help control DNA-associated processes. These proteins are important for many cellular functions, including gene expression and DNA repair. However, there is limited information about how these proteins work at the molecular level. In this study, researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a protein called Mot1 in complex with DNA and another protein called TBP. They found that Mot1 can reduce the interactions between TBP and DNA, and that it can also change the shape of the DNA. This study provides important information about how Swi2/Snf2 ATPases interact with their substrates and may help researchers understand how these proteins work in cells.'
 'Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. During meiosis, chromosomes are segregated in a precise and coordinated manner. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a key regulatory mechanism that ensures that all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle before anaphase begins. In this study, the authors investigated the role of Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in the regulation of the SAC. They found that Sgol2 plays an important role in turning off the SAC, in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching. The authors also found that Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, as is its ability to silence the SAC, with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation.'
 'Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. The pneumococcus spends most of the transmission cycle in the nasopharynx, and understanding and predicting the amount of time spent in this niche is critical for understanding this bacterium's epidemiology. Researchers have now developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. They estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. The study further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other significant locus effects (7%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.'
 'A new study has shed light on the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait found in at least 60 plant lineages. The study used a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental verification to show that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic factors. The study also found that the order of C4 trait acquisition was not fixed, but varied among different lineages. These findings suggest that the convergent evolution of C4 photosynthesis was facilitated by its flexibility. The study provides insights into the evolution of complex traits and has implications for efforts to engineer C4 photosynthesis into crop species.'
 Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To ensure efficient translation of its own mRNAs, IAV employs a strategy known as host shutoff, which involves the degradation of host mRNAs and the co-opting of the host translation machinery. In this study, the authors used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms of host shutoff in IAV-infected cells. They found that IAV does not preferentially translate its own mRNAs and that the reduction in host protein synthesis is mainly achieved by the degradation of host mRNAs. The authors also noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins are less affected by IAV infection, and their continuous expression supports the energetic demands that are essential for virus replication. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of host shutoff in IAV-infected cells and may help in the development of new antiviral strategies.
 'The circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus controls the timing of gene expression and metabolism in response to changes in light and dark periods. Deletion of the transcription factor RpaA, which is controlled by the circadian clock, causes cells to become inviable when exposed to alternating light and dark periods. The authors found that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions. The authors suggest that the circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations.'
α-helical coiled coils are a common protein fold found in a wide range of structural and functional contexts. They are made up of two or more α-helices wound into a supercoiled bundle and held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. The heptad repeat pattern, in which seven positions in a heptad are labeled a-g, with positions a and d oriented towards the core of the bundle and mostly hydrophobic, is the most prevalent. However, other periodicities are accessible to coiled coils, which is only restrained by the periodicity of the unperturbed α-helix. Insertions of 3 or 4 residues, known as stammers or stutters, can locally decrease or increase the periodicity of the heptad repeat pattern. These insertions can also cause the formation of short β-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. The authors describe the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. The authors propose that the variability of chemotaxis protein levels between genetically identical cells can change through mutations in the genes that control how many of the proteins are produced, and predict that such mutations allow populations to adapt to environmental changes. The experiments described in the paper could be used in the future to shed light on the behavior of other cells that are genetically identical but exhibit diverse behaviors, from other bacterial species to more complex cancer cells.
 'Hemoglobin ( Hb ) is a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The way Hb carries oxygen is influenced by its affinity and cooperativity for oxygen. Researchers have found that the affinity and cooperativity of Hb are adapted to the specific needs of different organisms. They have also found that the way Hb carries oxygen is influenced by the size of the organism. The researchers used a mathematical model to understand how Hb carries oxygen and how this is influenced by the size of the organism. They found that the way Hb carries oxygen is influenced by both its affinity and cooperativity for oxygen. They also found that the way Hb carries oxygen is influenced by the size of the organism. The researchers suggest that the way Hb carries oxygen is adapted to the specific needs of different organisms. Their findings provide insight into how proteins are adapted to meet the needs of different organisms.'
 'The female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla contains a switching valve that allows the female to compete for seminal gifts from multiple males. The valve is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. The valve allows the female to switch between two seminal capsules, which are used for fertilization and as a food source. The valve is a morphological novelty that may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. The evolution of this switching valve may have been driven by the need for females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats. The study of this valve provides insights into the construction principles of micron-scale biological structures and highlights the potential for engineering solutions to be inspired by nature.'
 'In this study, the authors used super-resolution microscopy to examine the diffusion of AMPARs, which are ionotropic glutamate receptors, outside of and within post-synaptic densities (PSDs) in rat neurons. They found that >90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorescent dyes or small quantum dots were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSDs, which were stable for 15 minutes or longer. Less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5-10% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs and 90-95% were extrasynaptic. The authors conclude that mobile AMPARs enter stable nanodomains in PSDs, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. Their findings suggest that AMPAR entry is not limited by the occupancy of open PSD 'slots', and that AMPARs rapidly enter stable 'nanodomains' in PSDs with a lifetime >15 minutes, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. The study provides new insights into the dynamics of AMPAR trafficking at synapses and may help to explain why bats are often the source for viruses that are deadly in humans.'
 'Histones are proteins that package DNA into compact structures called nucleosomes. These structures are important for regulating gene expression. In flies, a protein called DOMINO is responsible for adding a special type of histone called H2A.Z to the nucleosomes. This protein is made up of two different parts, called DOM-A and DOM-B. In this study, the authors found that these two parts make up two different proteins that do different things. DOM-B is responsible for adding H2A.Z to the nucleosomes, while DOM-A is responsible for adding chemical groups to histones. This study shows how different parts of a single protein can be used to do different things, which is important for understanding how genes are regulated.'
 'Membrane nanodomains have been implicated in Ras signaling, but what these domains are and how they interact with Ras remain obscure. Using single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) and detailed trajectory analysis, researchers have shown that distinct membrane domains dictate KRasG12D (an active KRas mutant) diffusion and trafficking in U2OS cells. KRasG12D exhibits an immobile state in ~70 nm domains, each embedded in a larger domain (~200 nm) that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. Moreover, KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. The results reveal how membrane organization dictates membrane diffusion and trafficking of Ras and offer new insight into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling.'
 'This is a scientific analysis of the effects of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells. The author was prompted to write this article after reading a series of high-profile reports that claimed to have found evidence of magnetism in biological systems. The first report claimed to have identified a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals ( Qin et al . , 2016 ). Two other articles reported magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field ( Stanley et al . , 2015; Wheeler et al . , 2016 ). The author argues that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units. If the reported phenomena do in fact occur, they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The author concludes that the physical laws by which magnetic fields act on matter are taught to science students in college ( Feynman et al . , 1963 ). Obviously those principles impose some constraints on what biological mechanisms are plausible candidates for both magnetosensation and magnetogenetics. The author’s goal is to offer some calculations as a supplement to those articles, which makes them appear in a rather different light. These arguments should also help in evaluating future hypotheses and in engineering new molecular tools.'
 'Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing . To investigate the neural basis for this strategy, individuals with amusia and controls read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary. They then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amusia group between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners. Connectivity differences between these regions were not present during a control task. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism.'
 'Iron is essential for the survival of nearly all organisms as it serves as a cofactor for a host of biochemical processes including oxygen storage, oxidative phosphorylation, and enzymatic reactions required for cellular proliferation. However, the levels of free iron in a cell must be tightly controlled to avoid the generation of reactive oxygen species. As such, iron metabolism is a tightly regulated process controlled by a network of iron-dependent proteins. The cell has evolved mechanisms whereby iron can be sequestered and released from protein complexes in response to changing iron levels. One such protein is ferritin, which forms a complex of 24 subunits (consisting of a mixture of ferritin heavy and light chains, FTH1 and FTL, respectively) capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms. When iron levels in the cell are low, ferritin is degraded allowing the release of iron for use by the cell. Ferritin is degraded in the lysosome and recent evidence implicated autophagy, a conserved catabolic cellular pathway, in the ‘ferritinophagy’ process. Through quantitative proteomic analysis of purified autophagosomes, we recently identified NCOA4 as the selective autophagy receptor that targets ferritin to the autophagosome, providing the first mechanistic explanation of how ferritinophagy occurs. We further showed that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is important for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. NCOA4 was subsequently identified as an ubiquitylation target when the VPS34 autophagy activator is inhibited and also was found to promote ferritinophagy. Three central questions emerge from this work. First, what molecular determinants drive the pathway and are the interactions between NCOA4 and ferritin direct? Second, given that NCOA4 levels appear to control flux through the ferritinophagy pathway, what mechanisms control the abundance of NCOA4? Third, what is the physiological role of NCOA4 in cellular processes that are highly dependent upon iron availability? Initial links between NCOA4 and processes with a requirement for high iron availability come from expression studies where ncoa4 mRNA is high at sites of erythropoiesis during zebrafish development. Moreover, recent transcriptomic analysis shows significant upregulation of NCOA4 at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation in humans, the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis, a highly iron-dependent process. Here, we use in-depth biochemical and cell culture studies, as well as the zebrafish system to dissect the roles of NCOA4, Ferritin, and HERC2 in mediating ferritinophagy and the role of ferritinophagy in erythropoiesis. We show that NCOA4 interacts directly with FTH1 via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1. Mutation at these binding sites abrogates binding in vivo and abolishes ferritinophagy. We show that the HERC2 ligase uses its ‘CUL7-homology domain’ to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby reducing the steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture. Surprisingly, we find that this same C-terminal domain within NCOA4 binds iron and the iron-bound state of NCOA4 determines HERC2 binding, suggesting an iron-dependent switch in NCOA4 turnover. Finally, we show that NCOA4 is important for erythropoiesis in vivo given its role in mobilizing iron from ferritin for use in heme synthesis. This study establishes the importance of NCOA4 as a critical regulator of cellular and organismal iron metabolism and reveals the mechanistic underpinnings of its iron-dependent regulation.'
 'Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning and other serious infections. To fight off Listeria, the body produces a protein called ISG15. ISG15 is a type of protein called a ubiquitin-like molecule (or ubl) that can bind to other proteins and change their function. In this study, the authors found that ISG15 is produced in large amounts in cells that are infected with Listeria. They also found that this production happens quickly and can happen without the help of a protein called interferon. The authors think that ISG15 might be able to help fight off Listeria by binding to proteins that are important for the bacteria to survive and change their function. They used a special technique called stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC) to find out which proteins ISG15 might be binding to. They found that ISG15 is binding to proteins that are important for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus to function properly. These proteins are important for the body to make and secrete cytokines, which are proteins that help fight off infections. The authors think that ISG15 might be able to help fight off Listeria by binding to these proteins and changing how they work. They also think that ISG15 might be able to help fight off other types of bacteria that can cause infections. This study is important because it helps us understand how the body fights off infections caused by bacteria. It also helps us understand how proteins like ISG15 can help fight off these infections.'
 'Odor stimuli are intermittent and dynamic in nature, and animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of odor stimuli. In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, researchers subjected fruit flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). They found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs, PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations. This study provides a rigorous understanding of sensory processing and highlights the importance of precise measurement of input stimuli and systematic exploration of the input space.'
