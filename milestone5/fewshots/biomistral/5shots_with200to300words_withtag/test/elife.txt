In this study, the authors used computational methods to model the structure of a protein called OafB, which is involved in the O-acetylation of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. LPS is a key component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and plays an important role in bacterial virulence. O-acetylation of LPS is a common post-translational modification that increases the diversity and complexity of the LPS structure, making it more difficult for the host immune system to recognize and eliminate the bacteria. The authors used the program RaptorX to model the structure of the AT3 domain of OafB, which is located in the inner membrane of the bacterial cell. They found that the AT3 domain has 10 transmembrane helices and is likely to form a stable structure under physiological conditions. They also used molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions between the AT3 domain and the periplasmic linking region, which connects the AT3 domain to the SGNH domain of OafB. The authors integrated their computational model with existing x-ray structures and mutational data to generate a refined functional model for OafB. Their findings provide important insights into the structure and function of AT3 domain-containing proteins and may have implications for the development of new antibiotics and vaccines.
 'Honey bees are known for their sophisticated decision-making abilities, which allow them to quickly and accurately assess their environment to determine which flowers offer nectar or pollen. In this study, researchers used a controlled flight arena to investigate the decision-making abilities of honey bees. They found that honey bees make both rapid and accurate decisions, and that their decisions are influenced by the quality and reliability of the evidence available. The researchers also developed a simple model of decision-making that can be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain and is neurobiologically plausible. Their findings suggest that the decision-making abilities of honey bees are the result of a complex system of interacting neural systems, and that these systems can be modeled using abstract theories of decision-making. The researchers propose that their model could be used to develop new technologies for autonomous decision-making in robotics.'
 'Metformin is a widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes that has been shown to extend lifespan in various organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are not well understood. In this study, the authors used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to investigate the role of ether lipids in metformin-mediated lifespan extension. They found that metformin stimulates ether lipid biogenesis, which is required for lifespan extension. The authors also found that ether lipids are necessary for lifespan extension under multiple genetic paradigms, including defective mitochondrial electron transport function, defective pharyngeal pumping/caloric restriction, and compromises in mTOR complex 1 activation. They further showed that overexpressing the enzyme that produces fatty alcohols for ether lipid biogenesis extends lifespan. The authors suggest that ether lipids enable organismal-level, longevity-promoting stress defenses. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metformin-mediated lifespan extension and suggest that ether lipids may be a novel therapeutic target for promoting healthy aging.'
 'Microbial communities in the gut play a crucial role in human health. However, the relationships between different microbes in the gut are not well understood. In this study, the authors used a robust statistical model to analyze the relationships between different microbes in the gut of baboons. They found that most microbial relationships are weak and negative, and that these relationships are generally consistent across hosts. The authors also found that taxa that are closely related phylogenetically tend to have positive relationships. These findings provide important insights into the relationships between different microbes in the gut and may help us understand how these communities affect human health.'

 'Replication of DNA in eukaryotic cells occurs in a highly coordinated manner, with certain regions of the genome replicating later than others. This is important for the proper functioning of the genome. The protein SUUR is involved in regulating the timing of DNA replication in Drosophila melanogaster. It has been shown that SUUR is required for underreplication of certain regions of the genome, including pericentric and intercalary heterochromatin. In this study, the authors used a new method called MERCI to isolate a stable complex of SUUR and a chromatin boundary protein called Mod. They found that SUUR and Mod work together to regulate the timing of DNA replication. The authors suggest that SUUR may regulate DNA replication by slowing down the progression of the replisome through heterochromatin regions. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of DNA replication regulation in eukaryotic cells.'
 'Biological age' is a concept that has been used to describe the aging process in humans. It is a measure of how old a person's body is, based on various biological markers such as telomere length, DNA methylation, and gene expression. While biological age is often used to describe adults, it is also important to understand how it relates to child development. In this study, researchers aimed to clarify the relationship between biological age and child developmental outcomes, including growth and adiposity, cognition, behavior, lung function, and the onset of puberty. They used data from the HELIX exposome cohort, which includes up to 1173 children aged between 5 and 12 years from study centers in the UK, France, Spain, Norway, Lithuania, and Greece. The researchers used four different biological age indicators: telomere length, DNA methylation age, and two novel candidate biological age indicators based on gene expression and immunometabolic markers. They found that all four biological age indicators were weakly correlated with each other. However, they also found that higher birthweight was associated with greater immunometabolic Δ age, smoke exposure with greater DNA methylation Δ age, and high family affluence with longer telomere length. Among associations with child developmental measures, all biological age markers were associated with greater BMI and fat mass, and all markers except telomere length were associated with greater height. Immunometabolic Δ age was associated with better working memory and reduced inattentiveness, while DNA methylation Δ age was associated with greater inattentiveness and poorer externalizing behaviors. Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors. In children, as in adults, biological aging appears to be a multi-faceted process and adiposity is an important correlate of accelerated biological aging. Patterns of associations suggested that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging, apparent even in children.'
 'Asthma is a complex disorder with multiple clinical phenotypes caused by a variety of mechanisms. A recent study used a novel approach to identify genetic associates of childhood wheezing phenotypes. The study conducted a multivariate genome-wide association meta-analysis of wheezing phenotypes jointly derived using unbiased analysis of data collected from birth to 18 years in 9568 individuals from five UK birth cohorts. The study identified 44 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with early-onset persistent, 25 with pre-school remitting, 33 with mid-childhood remitting, and 32 with late-onset wheeze. The study identified a novel locus on chr9q21.13 associated exclusively with early-onset persistent wheeze. The study also identified rs75260654 as the most likely causative SNP using Promoter Capture Hi-C loops and showed that the risk allele (T) confers a reduction in ANXA1 expression. Finally, the study demonstrated that anxa1 protein expression increased and anxa1 mRNA was significantly induced in lung tissue following house dust mite exposure. The study used UK Medical Research Council Programme Grant MR/S025340/1 and the Wellcome Trust Strategic Award (108818/15/Z) for funding. The study provides new insights into the genetic heterogeneity of asthma and identifies a novel locus associated with early-onset persistent wheeze that may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect.'
 'Intercropping' is a method of farming where two or more crops are grown together in the same field. This method has been shown to increase crop yields and improve soil health. However, the optimal way to choose which crops to grow together is not known. In this study, researchers grew six different crop species in various combinations and found that the best combinations were those where the plants had evolved to grow together over many generations. This suggests that intercropping should be done using crops that have been grown together for a long time, rather than randomly selecting crops to grow together. This could lead to more sustainable and efficient farming practices in the future. Keyword: 'ecology'.
 'Many real-world decisions are made while observing a partner’s actions. To study dynamic interactions during such decisions, researchers developed a setup where two agents engaged in game-theoretical tasks on a shared transparent touchscreen display. They compared human and macaque pairs in a transparent version of the coordination game 'Bach-or-Stravinsky', which involves a conflict about which of two individually-preferred opposing options to choose to achieve coordination. Most human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize the payoffs. All macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination. Remarkably, two animals learned to coordinate dynamically after training with a human confederate. This pair selected the faster agent’s preferred option, exhibiting turn-taking behavior that was captured by modeling the visibility of the partner’s action before one’s own movement. Such competitive turn-taking was unlike the prosocial turn-taking in humans, who equally often initiated switches to and from their preferred option. The dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans but can occur on the background of different social attitudes and cognitive capacities in rhesus monkeys. Overall, the results illustrate how action visibility promotes the emergence and maintenance of coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions.'
 'Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors (TFs) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, our cells form ovary-like organoids (ovoids) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.'
 'Our study of skin color variation in the Kalinago Territory of Dominica revealed that the population has a unique genetic makeup, with approximately 55% Native American, 32% African, and 12% European genetic ancestry. Skin pigmentation ranged from 20 to 80 melanin units, averaging 46. Three albino individuals were determined to be homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV contained within a haplotype of African origin. The allele frequency was 0.03 and the single allele effect size was –8 melanin units. Derived allele frequencies of SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F were 0.14 and 0.06, with single allele effect sizes of –6 and –4, respectively. Native American genetic ancestry by itself reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units. The responsible hypopigmenting genetic variants remain to be identified, since none of the published polymorphisms predicted in prior literature to affect skin color in Native Americans caused detectable hypopigmentation in the Kalinago. Our study highlights the importance of considering the unique genetic makeup of each population when studying skin color variation.'
 'Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Exercise and antioxidants are often recommended as treatments for diabetes, but the mechanisms behind their effects are not fully understood. In this study, the authors compared the effects of exercise and antioxidants on type 2 diabetic rats. They found that exercise and antioxidants both improved blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox state. The authors suggest that the activation of hepatic AMPK signaling, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as sentinel biomarkers, reflecting the threshold of redox balance linked to effective glucose control in diabetes. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.'
 'The escape trajectory (ET) of prey is a crucial factor in avoiding predation. Previous geometric models predicted a single ET, but many species show highly variable ETs. The authors constructed a novel geometric model that incorporates the time required for prey to turn and the predator’s position at the end of its attack. The optimal ET was determined by maximizing the time difference of arrival at the edge of the safety zone between the prey and predator. By fitting the model to experimental data of fish Pagrus major, the authors show that the model can clearly explain the observed multiple preferred ETs. By changing the parameters of the same model within a realistic range, the authors were able to produce various patterns of ETs empirically observed in other species. Their results open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.'
 'Prime editing (PE) is a new genome editing technology that has the potential to revolutionize the field of stem cell research. PE uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA) to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. PE is more efficient and precise than conventional gene editing methods in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and can generate heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By optimizing the delivery modalities for the PE components, editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles were achieved. This mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson’s disease in hPSCs. Overall, PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs.'
 'Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow. Researchers have developed a way to classify MM patients into different stages based on their risk of death. To better understand the differences between these stages, the researchers used a technique called single-cell transcriptome sequencing to analyze the genes expressed by individual cells in the bone marrow of MM patients. They found that a certain type of immune cell, called a cytotoxic plasma cell, was more common in patients with stage II MM. They also found that a protein called ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) was more commonly expressed in MM cells and was associated with worse outcomes for patients. The researchers also looked at how different types of immune cells interacted with each other and with MM cells. They found that certain interactions between immune cells and MM cells were associated with worse outcomes for patients. Overall, the researchers' findings provide new insights into the differences between different stages of MM and may help guide the development of new treatments for the disease.'
 'The CRISPR-Cas system is a powerful tool for genome editing and interference. Cas7-11 is a type of CRISPR-Cas effector that has the potential for programmable RNA interference. A recent study has determined the cryo-EM structure of Desulfonema ishimotonii Cas7-11 (DiCas7-11), revealing the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form that resembles the backbone made up by four Cas7 and one Cas11 subunits in the multi-subunit enzymes. Unlike the multi-subunit enzymes, however, the backbone of DiCas7-11 contains evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains, giving rise to their unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and its free-standing fragment retains most of the activity. Both the second and the third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The structure and mutational data indicate that the long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7 domain has little impact on RNA processing or targeting, suggesting the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool. The study provides valuable insights into the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities of Cas7-11, which may be useful for developing new genome editing and interference tools.'
 'Addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity . While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity , our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited . Here , we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity on tree productivity , and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks . We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity , reduced soil fungal diversity , and marginally reduced herbivory . The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested . Given the complexity of interactions between species and genetic diversity , tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity , we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation .'
 'Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but it remains challenging to track single molecules while simultaneously detecting their interactions. In this study, the authors describe a novel property of rhodamine dyes called proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), in which one fluorophore (the ‘sender’) can reactivate a second fluorophore (the ‘receiver’) from a dark state. PAPA requires proximity between the two fluorophores, yet it operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The authors show that PAPA can be used in live cells to detect protein–protein interactions and to highlight a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. In proof-of-concept experiments, PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. These results establish a new way in which a photophysical property of fluorophores can be harnessed to study molecular interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells.'
 'Calcium is an important mineral for bone health and development. However, the effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in young people under 35 years old is inconclusive. To comprehensively summarize the evidence for the effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in young populations, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The study identified 43 studies involving 7,382 subjects. Moderate certainty of evidence showed that calcium supplementation was associated with the accretion of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in young people, especially on the femoral neck, total body, and lumbar spine. Subgroup analyses suggested that the improvement of bone at the femoral neck was more pronounced in the peripeak bone mass (PBM) population (20-35 years) than the pre-PBM population (<20 years). The findings provided novel insights and evidence in calcium supplementation, which showed that calcium supplementation significantly improves bone mass, implying that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving PBM may be a shift in the window of intervention for osteoporosis. This work was supported by Wenzhou Medical University grant [89219029].'
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly contagious and deadly virus that causes seasonal flu and pandemics. IAV replicates by forming liquid-like condensates in the cytosol of infected cells. These condensates are thought to be important for IAV genome assembly. In this study, the authors used a combination of live-cell imaging and biophysical techniques to investigate the properties of IAV liquid condensates. They found that the liquid condensates are highly dynamic and can fuse with each other. They also found that the liquid condensates are highly elastic and can deform in response to external forces. The authors then used a small molecule called nucleozin to harden the liquid condensates. They found that nucleozin hardened the condensates by increasing the strength of interactions between the viral RNA and the nucleoprotein. The authors then tested the efficacy of nucleozin in vivo by treating mice with IAV. They found that nucleozin reduced the viral load in the lungs of infected mice. Overall, this study provides important insights into the properties of IAV liquid condensates and suggests that targeting the material properties of these condensates could be a novel approach for treating influenza infections.'
 'Kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors that move along microtubules to transport various cargos. Kinesin-4 is a unique motor that inhibits microtubule dynamics. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin dimers revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin, which is in between the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends. KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics. This study provides a structural model of microtubule dynamics inhibition by the kinesin-4 motor domain, which is essential for proper length control of axons. The findings may contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of diseases caused by mutations in kinesin-4 family proteins.
 'Germline stem cells (GSCs) are a type of stem cell that can self-renew or launch complex differentiation programs. Drosophila female GSCs are a good model for studying these processes. GSCs are found in the germarium, a specialized tissue in the ovaries. GSCs divide to make daughter cells that become cystoblasts, which develop into nurse cells and oocytes. GSCs have a unique chromatin structure that is maintained over many generations. This structure is important for the GSCs to be able to resist transposon activity. GSCs also have a unique metabolism that is important for their maintenance and differentiation. Scientists have studied the gene expression, chromatin structure, and metabolism of GSCs in detail. They have found that GSCs have a unique way of controlling transposable elements, which are pieces of DNA that can move around in the genome and cause problems. They have also found that GSCs have a unique way of controlling gene expression and metabolism. These findings help scientists understand how GSCs are able to maintain their unique properties over many generations.'
 'Biological rhythms are important for many aspects of life, including development and reproduction. In plants, the circadian clock controls daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In this study, the authors found that the circadian clock also controls the timing of late-stage floret development in domesticated sunflowers. They discovered that floral organ growth is regulated by circadian rhythms, and that the effects of light on this process are time-of-day dependent. The authors also found that disruption of circadian rhythms in floral organ development causes loss of pseudowhorl formation and large reductions in pollinator visits. These findings suggest that the circadian clock plays a role in the spatial patterning of development in plants, and that it is important for plant reproductive success.'
 'Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive chemical that can damage the macromolecules required for life. Organisms have defense mechanisms to deal with this threat, but the extent to which these defenses are adjusted to balance the temperature-dependent threat of hydrogen peroxide is not well understood. In this study, researchers used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to explore how temperature regulates how multicellular organisms deal with the threat of hydrogen peroxide. They found that nematodes preemptively induce the expression of specific hydrogen peroxide defenses in response to perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons. These neurons communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical. The findings of this study provide new insights into how organisms adapt to the temperature-dependent threat of hydrogen peroxide.'
 'Class switch recombination (CSR) is a process that allows the immune system to produce different types of antibodies. This process involves the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the repair of these breaks. However, the process of repairing these breaks can sometimes lead to errors, such as insertion mutations. In this study, researchers used mouse models to investigate the role of two enzymes in the repair of DNA DSBs during CSR. They found that the loss of these enzymes led to an increase in R loops, which are three-stranded nucleotide structures that can form when newly synthesized RNA re-anneals to the DNA template. This increase in R loops led to an increase in genome instability and insertion mutations. The researchers propose that these enzymes work together to mediate timely R loop removal, promoting efficient repair while suppressing AID-dependent genome instability and insertional mutagenesis. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of CSR and the repair of DNA DSBs during this process. '
 'Large-scale populations worldwide have been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines, but breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2 are still growing rapidly due to the emergence of immune-evasive variants, especially Omicron. It is urgent to develop effective broad-spectrum vaccines to better control the pandemic of these variants. Here, we present a mosaic-type trimeric form of spike receptor-binding domain (mos-tri-RBD) as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate, which carries the key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants. Tests in rats showed that the designed mos-tri-RBD, whether used alone or as a booster shot, elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against not only Omicron but also other immune-evasive variants. Neutralizing antibody ID50 titers induced by mos-tri-RBD were substantially higher than those elicited by homo-tri-RBD (containing homologous RBDs from prototype strain) or the BIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). Our study indicates that mos-tri-RBD is highly immunogenic, which may serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate in combating SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.'
 'Malaria is a disease caused by parasites that infect red blood cells in humans. These parasites need to digest the hemoglobin in the red blood cells to survive. One of the enzymes that helps them do this is called PfA-M17. In this study, researchers used genetic and chemical methods to show that PfA-M17 is essential for the survival of the malaria parasite. They also found that PfA-M17 helps the parasite digest hemoglobin by breaking down leucine, one of the amino acids in hemoglobin. The researchers also found that when they blocked PfA-M17 from working, the parasites had multiple digestive vacuoles instead of just one. This suggests that PfA-M17 helps the parasite digest hemoglobin more efficiently. The researchers also found that when they blocked PfA-M17 from working, the parasites accumulated peptides that were likely to come from hemoglobin. This supports the idea that PfA-M17 helps the parasite digest hemoglobin. Overall, this study shows that PfA-M17 is an important enzyme for the survival of the malaria parasite and helps it digest hemoglobin more efficiently.'
 'Early hematopoiesis is a continuous process in which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) gradually differentiate toward specific lineages . Aging and myeloid malignant transformation are characterized by changes in the composition and regulation of HSPCs . In this study , the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to characterize an enriched population of human HSPCs obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals . Based on their transcriptional profile , the authors identified changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging , and differences in their functionality , as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis . Trajectory inference revealed that altered gene expression dynamics accompanied cell differentiation , which could explain aging-associated changes in hematopoiesis . Next , the authors focused on key regulators of transcription by constructing gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) and detected regulons that were specifically active in elderly individuals . Using previous findings in healthy cells as a reference , the authors analyzed scRNA-seq data obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) and detected specific alterations of the expression dynamics of genes involved in erythroid differentiation in all patients with MDS such as TRIB2 . In addition , the comparison between transcriptional programs and GRNs regulating normal HSPCs and MDS HSPCs allowed the identification of regulons that were specifically active in MDS cases such as SMAD1 , HOXA6 , POU2F2 , and RUNX1 suggesting a role of these transcription factors ( TFs ) in the pathogenesis of the disease . In summary , the authors demonstrate that the combination of single-cell technologies with computational analysis tools enable the study of a variety of cellular mechanisms involved in complex biological systems such as early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with perturbations such as aging and malignant transformation . Furthermore , the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients .'
 'Latent inhibition' is a type of learning in which an animal ignores a stimulus that has been presented to them without any consequence, but then learns to respond to that stimulus when it is paired with a reward. Honey bees show latent inhibition towards an odor they have experienced without any reward. Individual honey bees from the same colony differ in their degree of latent inhibition, and these differences have a genetic basis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these individual differences, two honey bee lines were selected for high and low latent inhibition, respectively. These lines were then crossed, and a Quantitative Trait Locus for latent inhibition was mapped to a region of the genome that contains the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Disruption of Amtyr1 signaling either pharmacologically or through RNAi qualitatively changed the expression of latent inhibition but had little or slight effects on appetitive conditioning. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain during pharmacological blockade were consistent with a model that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the CNS. The results suggest that Amtyr1 acts as a gain control to modulate hebbian plasticity at defined synapses in the CNS. The study identifies a distinct Amtyr1-based modulatory pathway for this type of nonassociative learning and proposes a model for how Amtyr1 acts as a gain control to modulate inhibitory processing in the CNS. The findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying individual differences in learning and memory in honey bees and other animals.'
 'The airway epithelium is composed of many different cell types that work together to maintain the health of the airways. However, it can be difficult to identify and study these cells in live tissues. In this study, the authors developed a new method for identifying and studying the different cell types in the airway epithelium. They used the endogenous autofluorescence of the metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD to distinguish between different cell types in real time. They were able to identify all seven of the airway epithelial cell types in mouse tracheal explants, and they found that this method was more reliable than using ostensibly cell type-specific markers. They also used this method to study the dynamic formation of secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs) in response to cholinergic stimulus. The SAPs were found to be associated with antigen presenting cells, suggesting that they play a role in antigen sampling. Overall, this study provides a new tool for studying the different cell types in the airway epithelium and their functions in real time.'
 'Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of adult heart to regenerate after injury . N6-methyladenosine ( m6A ) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 ( Mettl3 ) plays an important role in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses . However , the role of m6A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear . To study m6A function in heart regeneration , researchers modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo . Knockdown of Mettl3 significantly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice . However , Mettl3 overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice . Conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing ( MeRIP-seq ) and RNA-seq identified Fgf16 as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification during postnatal heart regeneration . RIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Mettl3 negatively regulates Fgf16 mRNA expression in an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent manner . The silencing of Fgf16 suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes . However , the overexpression of ΔFgf16 , in which the m6A consensus sequence was mutated , significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16 . The data demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces Fgf16 mRNA levels through an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent pathway , thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration .'
 'The risk of developing a second primary cancer (SPC) after the first primary cancer (FPC) is increasing. The underlying causal relationship is unclear. In this study, the authors conducted a pan-cancer association study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. They found 11 significant cross-correlations among different cancers after harmonizing the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) results. The authors identified that patients initially diagnosed with oral pharyngeal cancer had an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while patients initially diagnosed with ovary cancer had an increased risk of soft tissue cancer. In addition, patients initially diagnosed with kidney cancer were likely to develop lung cancer and myeloma. The authors suggest that certain types of primary cancer may cause another second primary cancer, and the profound mechanisms need to be studied in the future.'
 'In economic decision-making, individuals choose between items based on their perceived value. For both humans and nonhuman primates, these decisions are often carried out while shifting gaze between the available options. Recent studies in humans suggest that these shifts in gaze actively influence choice, manifesting as a bias in favor of the items that are viewed first, viewed last, or viewed for the overall longest duration in a given trial. To identify the mechanism that links gaze behavior to the neural computations underlying value-based choices, researchers have created a novel value-based choice task for macaque monkeys that captures the essential features of the human paradigms in which gaze biases have been observed. Using this task, researchers identified gaze biases in the monkeys that were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in humans. In addition, the monkeys’ gaze biases were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework previously used to describe gaze biases in humans. Together, these findings suggest a common mechanism that can explain gaze-related choice biases across species, and open the way for mechanistic studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.'
 'Dietary generalism' is a phenomenon where an organism can survive on a wide variety of food sources. It is unclear whether this is due to a 'generic' metabolic response or a 'multi-host' metabolic specialism. In this study, researchers used fruit diets and individuals of the generalist insect species Drosophila suzukii to investigate this question. They found that individuals on different diets had similar metabolic profiles, suggesting a generic metabolic response. They also identified diet-specific metabolites in generalist individuals, which could be used to discriminate them according to their diet. This study provides new insights into the metabolic basis of dietary generalism.
 'Yersinia pestis is a bacterium that causes the bubonic plague. It evolved from a less virulent ancestor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, through a series of genetic changes that enabled it to survive and colonize fleas. One of these changes was the acquisition of the ymt gene, which allowed Y. pestis to survive in the flea gut. Another change was the loss of three genes, rcsA, pde2, and pde3, which altered the c-di-GMP signalling pathway and increased biofilm-forming capability. The Rcs phosphorelay system, a non-orthodox two-component signal transduction system, is involved in this process. In this study, the authors found that a frameshift mutation in the rcsD gene, which encodes a component of the Rcs signalling pathway, resulted in the production of a small protein called RcsD-Hpt. This protein plays a dominant role in Rcs signalling in Y. pestis and alters the expression of dozens of genes and the capacity for biofilm formation. These genetic changes may represent an important step in the emergence of ubiquitous branches of Y. pestis that can capably maintain plague outbreaks.'
 'The peer review process is a crucial step in the publication of scientific research, where manuscripts are evaluated by independent experts in the field before being accepted for publication. However, concerns have been raised regarding subjectivity in this process that may affect the fairness and accuracy of evaluations. This study used OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, to analyze language use in over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022–2023. The results demonstrated high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The study also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. In addition, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author. The study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts and underscores the importance of transparent peer review in studying equitability in scientific publishing.'
 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and deadly cancer that often spreads to the liver. New strategies to reduce the risk of liver colonization are needed. In this study, the authors used mouse models of liver metastasis to show that continuous infusion of interferon-alpha (IFNα) controls CRC invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). IFNα promoted the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) defenestration, extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition, thus strengthening the liver vascular barrier and impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration. IFNα also endowed LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential that supported the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and ultimately led to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.'
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major public health concern in humans and animals. Swine are susceptible to IAV infections from multiple hosts and can generate novel reassortant viruses with zoonotic and pandemic potential. Vaccination is a common practice in swine herds to prevent IAV infections, but the impact of vaccination on IAV evolutionary trajectories in pigs is not well understood. In this study, the authors directly sequenced bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains. They identified 54 reassortant viruses that were grouped in 17 single and 16 mixed genotypes. Notably, prime-boost vaccinated pigs had less reassortant viruses than nonvaccinated pigs, likely due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses. However, direct sequencing from BALF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. Overall, the results highlight the value of IAV vaccination not only at limiting virus replication in pigs but also at protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential.'
 'The hippocampus is a brain structure that plays a key role in memory formation and storage. One way that the hippocampus stores memories is through the activity of neurons called place cells, which fire when an animal is in a particular location in space. In a new study, researchers used a technique called in vivo calcium imaging to record the activity of place cells in the hippocampus of rats as they navigated a maze. The researchers found that when rats learned to avoid a particular location on the maze (i.e., they learned to associate that location with a negative outcome), the place cells in the hippocampus remapped their firing fields to reflect this new association. This remapping was more prevalent when the rats remembered the negative outcome (i.e., when they had learned to avoid the location) than when they had forgotten it. These findings suggest that place cell remapping may play a role in storing memories of aversive events.'
 'HIV-1 infection results in the activation of inflammasome that may facilitate viral spread and establishment of viral reservoirs. We evaluated the effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Expression of caspase-1 , NLRP3 , and IL-1β was increased in lymph nodes and bone marrow between day 1 and 3 after HIV-1 infection ( mean fold change ( FC ) of 2 . 08 , 3 . 23 , and 6 . 05 , p<0 . 001 , respectively ) . IFI16 and AIM2 expression peaked at day 24 and coincides with increased IL-18 levels ( 6 . 89 vs 83 . 19 pg/ml , p=0 . 004 ) , increased viral load and CD4+ T cells loss in blood ( p<0 . 005 and p<0 . 0001 , for the spleen respectively ) . Treatment with VX-765 significantly reduced TNF-α at day 11 ( 0 . 47 vs 2 . 2 pg/ml , p=0 . 045 ) , IL-18 at day 22 ( 7 . 8 vs 23 . 2 pg/ml , p=0 . 04 ) , CD4+ T cells ( 44 . 3% vs 36 , 7% , p=0 . 01 ) , viral load ( 4 . 26 vs 4 . 89 log 10 copies/ml , p=0 . 027 ) , and total HIV-1 DNA in the spleen ( 1 054 vs 2 889 copies /106 cells , p=0 . 029 ) . We demonstrated that targeting inflammasome activation early after infection may represent a therapeutic strategy towards HIV cure to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion and reduce immune activation , viral load , and the HIV-1 reservoir formation .'
 'The loss of a spouse is often cited as the most traumatic event in a person’s life . However, for most people, the severity of grief and its maladaptive effects subside over time via an understudied adaptive process . Like humans, socially monogamous prairie voles ( Microtus ochrogaster ) form opposite-sex pair bonds, and upon partner separation, show stress phenotypes that diminish over time . We test the hypothesis that extended partner separation diminishes pair bond-associated behaviors and causes pair bond transcriptional signatures to erode . We found that these behaviors persist despite prolonged separation in both same-sex and opposite-sex paired voles . Opposite-sex pair bonding led to changes in accumbal transcription that were stably maintained while animals remained paired but eroded following prolonged partner separation . Eroded genes are associated with gliogenesis and myelination, suggesting a previously undescribed role for glia in pair bonding and loss . Further, we pioneered neuron-specific translating ribosomal affinity purification in voles. Neuronally enriched transcriptional changes revealed dopaminergic-, mitochondrial-, and steroid hormone signaling-associated gene clusters sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation. Our results suggest that partner separation erodes transcriptomic signatures of pair bonding despite core behavioral features of the bond remaining intact, revealing potential molecular processes priming a vole to be able to form a new bond.'
 'Motor variability is a fundamental feature of developing systems that allows motor exploration and learning. In human infants, leg movements involve a small number of basic coordination patterns called locomotor primitives. However, whether and when motor variability could emerge from these primitives remains unknown. Here, we longitudinally followed 18 infants on 2–3 time points between birth and walking onset and recorded the activity of their leg muscles during locomotor or rhythmic movements. Using unsupervised machine learning, we show that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development. In the neonatal period, infants own a minimal number of motor primitives but generate a maximal motor variability across trials thanks to variable activations of these primitives. A few months later, toddlers generate significantly less variability despite the existence of more primitives due to more regularity within their activation. These results suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration as soon as birth by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives that later fraction and become more consistently activated by the motor system.'
The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium (GTGC) is a new initiative that aims to bring together researchers and public health professionals to share and analyze data on the genetic diversity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever. The GTGC has collected and analyzed data from over 13,000 genomes of Typhi isolates from around the world, and has identified patterns of genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance that can inform public health policies and strategies. The GTGC has also developed a new tool for analyzing Typhi genomes, which can be used by researchers and public health professionals to quickly and easily identify patterns of genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance in their own data. The GTGC is committed to making its data and tools freely available to all researchers and public health professionals, and to working collaboratively to advance our understanding of typhoid fever and develop new strategies for controlling it.
 'Plants have evolved mechanisms to synchronize their flowering time with the changing seasons. One such mechanism is vernalization, a process that occurs during winter and promotes flowering in the following spring. In Arabidopsis thaliana, vernalization is achieved through the epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). In this study, the authors identified that C-repeat/dehydration-responsive elements (CRT/DREs) at the 3′-end of FLC are required for the cold-induced expression of COOLAIR, an antisense RNA transcribed from the FLC locus. They also showed that CBFs, which are cold-induced transcription factors, bind to CRT/DREs at the 3′-end of FLC and promote COOLAIR expression during early stages of vernalization. The authors propose that CRT/DREs and CBFs play important roles in the cold-induced expression of COOLAIR during vernalization, which is a critical step in the floral promotion process.'
 'HIV-1 is a virus that causes AIDS, a disease that affects the immune system. HIV-1 is treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), which stops the virus from replicating. However, even with ART, HIV-1 can still persist in the body in a state called latency. HIV-1 latency is when the virus is not actively replicating, but it is still present in the body. HIV-1 latency is thought to be caused by the virus being integrated into the host cell's DNA, which makes it difficult for the virus to be detected and destroyed by the immune system. HIV-1 latency is a major obstacle to finding a cure for AIDS, because it allows the virus to persist in the body even when ART is taken. To better understand HIV-1 latency, researchers have been studying the virus in different parts of the body. In this study, researchers used a new technology called single-genome proviral sequencing to study HIV-1 in different parts of the body, including the brain. They found that HIV-1 was present in the brain, even though the participants had been taking ART for many years. They also found that the virus was not actively replicating in the brain, but it was still present in the body. This study provides important information about HIV-1 latency and how it affects the brain. It also highlights the need for more research to better understand HIV-1 latency and how it can be eliminated.'
 'Circadian clocks are a type of biological clock that regulate the timing of various physiological processes in living organisms. These clocks are controlled by a group of genes that work together to produce a rhythmic pattern of gene expression. Circadian clocks are found in almost every tissue in the body and are thought to be controlled by a central clock in the brain. The function of circadian clocks is important for many aspects of health, including sleep, metabolism, and hormone regulation. However, the function of circadian clocks can be disrupted by various factors, such as genetic mutations or environmental factors. In order to better understand the function of circadian clocks, researchers need to be able to monitor the activity of these clocks in real time. In this study, researchers developed a new method to monitor the activity of circadian clocks in live animals. This method, called Locally Activatable BioLuminescence (LABL), uses a genetically engineered protein that produces light when it is activated by a specific signal. By using LABL, researchers were able to monitor the activity of circadian clocks in different parts of the body and in response to different genetic mutations. This new method will allow researchers to better understand the function of circadian clocks and how they are affected by different factors.'
 'Membrane trafficking is a complex process that involves the movement of proteins and lipids from one cellular compartment to another. This process is regulated by a variety of proteins, including coat complexes that help to sort and transport cargo. In yeast, the retromer complex is a coat complex that helps to sort cargo from the endosome to the plasma membrane. The retromer complex is composed of several subunits, including the SNX-BAR protein Vps5. However, a second SNX-BAR protein, Vrl1, has been overlooked due to an inactivating mutation found in commonly studied strains. In this study, the authors demonstrate that Vrl1 has features of a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms an obligate complex with Vin1, the paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5. The VINE complex occupies endosomal tubules and redistributes a conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like protein from endosomes. The authors also find that membrane recruitment by Vin1 is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity, suggesting that VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome. This study provides new insights into the role of SNX-BAR coat complexes in membrane trafficking and their potential impact on human health.'
 'Interspecific interactions are key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of ecological communities. However, tracking and quantifying interactions of marine fish species are difficult, especially under field conditions. In this study, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to detect and quantify interactions of marine fish species in the Boso Peninsula, Japan. We collected eDNA samples twice a month for two years and analyzed eDNA monitoring data using nonlinear time series analytical tools. We detected fish–fish interactions as information flow between eDNA time series and reconstructed interaction networks for the top 50 frequently detected species. We quantified pairwise, fluctuating interaction strengths and found that water temperature influenced fish–fish interaction strengths. The impact of water temperature on interaction strengths varied among fish species, suggesting that fish species identity influences the temperature effects on interactions. Our research demonstrates a practical research framework to study the effects of environmental variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature, which would contribute to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.'
 'The avian palaeognath phylogeny has been recently revised significantly due to the advancement of genome-wide comparative analyses and provides the opportunity to trace the evolution of the microstructure and crystallography of modern dinosaur eggshells. Here, eggshells of all major clades of Palaeognathae (including extinct taxa) and selected eggshells of Neognathae and non-avian dinosaurs are analyzed with electron backscatter diffraction. Our results show the detailed microstructures and crystallographies of (previously) loosely categorized ostrich-, rhea-, and tinamou-style morphotypes of palaeognath eggshells. All rhea-style eggshell appears homologous, while respective ostrich-style and tinamou-style morphotypes are best interpreted as homoplastic morphologies (independently acquired). Ancestral state reconstruction and parsimony analysis additionally show that rhea-style eggshell represents the ancestral state of palaeognath eggshells both in microstructure and crystallography. The ornithological and palaeontological implications of the current study are not only helpful for the understanding of evolution of modern and extinct dinosaur eggshells but also aid other disciplines where palaeognath eggshells provide useful archive for comparative contrasts (e.g., palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, geochronology, and zooarchaeology).'
 'Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are important for communication and navigation in many species. Researchers are increasingly using USVs as a behavioral measure in neurodevelopmental and neurolinguistic research. However, accurately attributing USVs to their emitter during close interactions is a key challenge. The Hybrid Vocalization Localizer (HyVL) is a new system that synergistically integrates a high-resolution acoustic camera with high-quality ultrasound microphones. HyVL is the first to achieve millimeter precision (~3.4–4.8 mm, 91% assigned) in localizing USVs, ~3× better than other systems, approaching the physical limits (mouse snout ~10 mm). The system was analyzed using mouse courtship interactions and demonstrated that males and females vocalize in starkly different relative spatial positions, and that the fraction of female vocalizations has likely been overestimated previously due to imprecise localization. The system also found that when two male mice interact with one female, one of the males takes a dominant role in the interaction both in terms of the vocalization rate and the location relative to the female. HyVL substantially improves the precision with which social communication between rodents can be studied. It is also affordable, open-source, easy to set up, can be integrated with existing setups, and reduces the required number of experiments and animals. ', Keyword: 'ultrasonic vocalizations'
 'Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction that produce force in all striated muscles. The nanoarchitecture of sarcomeres is determined by the large titin protein, which spans from the Z-disc to the M-band in vertebrates. However, the role of titin in determining sarcomere architecture outside of vertebrates is not well understood. In this study, the authors used a series of nanobodies to determine the precise location of two Drosophila titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, in the sarcomere of flight muscles. By combining nanobodies with DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy, the authors found that Sallimus bridges across the flight muscle I-band, whereas Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band. Interestingly, the ends of both proteins overlap at the I-band/A-band border, revealing a staggered organization of the two Drosophila titin homologs. This architecture may help to stably anchor Sallimus at the myosin filament and hence ensure efficient force transduction during flight. The study provides important insights into the nanoarchitecture of sarcomeres in non-vertebrate animals and highlights the importance of titin in determining sarcomere architecture across species.'
 'A new method has been developed to measure the viscoelastic properties of individual cells. The method uses a microfluidic device to apply shear stress to cells suspended in a high-viscosity fluid. The resulting deformations of the cells are captured using a camera and analyzed to extract the storage and loss moduli of the cells. The method is simple, low-cost, and high-throughput, making it suitable for use in a variety of applications. The method has been validated using calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells, and has been shown to be accurate and robust. The method can be used to study the viscoelastic properties of cells in different contexts, such as during cell division, migration, and adhesion. The method can also be used to study the effects of drugs and other treatments on the viscoelastic properties of cells. Overall, the method provides a powerful tool for studying the viscoelastic properties of cells and their role in cellular processes.'
 'Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells, producing energy through a process called cellular respiration. Mitochondria are also involved in other important cellular processes, such as regulating cell death and calcium levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to a variety of diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and heart disease. In this study, the authors investigated the role of mitochondrial fusion in mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial fusion is the process by which two mitochondria combine to form one larger mitochondrion. The authors found that a mutation in a protein called mitofusin 2 (MFN2) was responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in a rare form of heart disease. The mutation caused mitochondria to become fragmented, which impaired their ability to produce energy. The authors also found that the mutation caused mitochondria to become less mobile, which could lead to problems with calcium levels in the cell. The study provides important insights into the role of mitochondrial fusion in mitochondrial dysfunction and could lead to new treatments for heart disease.'
 'Olfactory cues can have a significant impact on the development and lifespan of mice. In this study, the authors found that female mice exposed to odors from adult females lived significantly longer than those exposed to male odors or no odors. The authors also found that the effect of female odors on lifespan was not due to changes in stress response or growth rate. The authors suggest that the effect of female odors on lifespan may be due to changes in the development of the olfactory system. The study provides evidence for the importance of olfactory cues in shaping the development and lifespan of mice.'
 'Chemogenetics is a powerful tool for studying the role of specific neurons in the brain. It involves the use of genetically modified mice that express receptors that can be activated by drugs. These drugs, called designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), can be used to control the activity of specific neurons in the brain. In this study, the authors used DREADDs to study the effects of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), a drug commonly used to activate DREADDs, on sleep in wild-type mice. They found that CNO dose-dependently suppressed REM sleep, changed the power of EEG spectral during NREM sleep, and altered sleep architecture. The authors suggest that these effects are due to the back-metabolism of CNO to clozapine, which is known to affect sleep. However, they also found that a novel DREADD agonist, compound 21 (C21), similarly modulates sleep despite a lack of back-metabolism to clozapine. The authors suggest that this finding implies that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying side effects of chemogenetic actuators. They recommend that any chemogenetic experiment should include a DREADD-free control group injected with the same CNO, C21, or newly developed actuator. The authors suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators.'
 'Microorganisms sense and respond to chemical gradients in their environment, which is essential for their survival and reproduction. Microfluidic devices have been used to study microbial chemotaxis, but they are limited by their ability to screen a wide range of chemical compounds and concentrations. A new microfluidic multiplexed chemotaxis device (MCD) was developed that uses serial dilution to simultaneously perform six parallel bacterial chemotaxis assays that span five orders of magnitude in chemostimulant concentration on a single chip. The MCD was validated and compared to a standard microfluidic assay. The MCD's versatility was assessed by quantifying the chemotactic responses of different bacteria to different chemoattractants and chemorepellents. The MCD vastly accelerates the chemotactic screening process, which is critical to deciphering the complex sea of chemical stimuli underlying microbial responses. The MCD is a powerful tool for studying microbial chemotaxis and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of microbial behavior in complex environments.'
 'Neural crest cells are a crucial, multipotent cell population in the vertebrate embryo that undergoes a series of events, including induction, specification, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), to migrate and form a variety of tissues, including craniofacial structures, components of the peripheral nervous system, and many other derivatives. The transcriptional control of these events has been mapped into modules of a feed-forward gene regulatory network (GRN), which helps explain the detailed sequence of events involved in neural crest development. Recently, there has been growing appreciation for the role that post-transcriptional regulation plays in the establishment, maintenance, and regulation of neural crest formation. Using existing single-cell RNA-sequencing data from avian embryos, we identified Elavl1 as an enriched transcript in newly formed neural crest cells. Elavl1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein from the ELAV family of RNA-binding proteins, which have conserved roles in neural development. It is a well-established stabilizer of mRNA, often mediated via association with the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of its mRNA targets. We found that perturbation of Elavl1 led to premature neural crest delamination and significant reduction in the expression of genes within the neural crest specification GRN. We discovered that these effects were mediated by loss of Draxin, a direct mRNA target for stabilization by Elavl1. Our data demonstrate a critical role for Elavl1 and RNA-binding protein-mediated post-transcriptional control in the regulation of a critical neural crest specification module.'
 'Breathing is essential for life, and the neural circuits that control it are complex. In this study, researchers found that a combination of type I and II cadherins is required for the development and function of respiratory circuits. Deleting cadherins in either motor neurons or Dbx1-derived interneurons that give rise to the premotor rVRG leads to severe respiratory insufficiency and death within hours of birth. The researchers found that cadherins are crucial for respiratory motor output, as motor neuron-specific cadherin inactivation leads to a striking decrease in phrenic motor neuron activity. They also found that cadherins establish motor neuron cell body positioning and dendritic orientation, but surprisingly, cell body positioning is likely dispensable for proper motor neuron firing. Finally, the researchers found that cadherin signaling is required in Dbx1-derived interneurons for proper motor neuron firing. Overall, the study suggests a model where cadherin-mediated adhesive recognition dictates wiring specificity through multifaceted functions in dendritic organization and molecular recognition.'
 'Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media platforms, contributing to polarization, racism, and vaccine hesitancy. In this study, the authors tested whether the incentive structure of social media platforms could be altered to reduce the spread of misinformation. They found that when participants were given the option to react to posts with "trust" and "distrust" buttons, they shared more true information and less false information. The authors suggest that this intervention could be adopted to reduce misinformation spread without reducing engagement. The study provides insights into the specific mechanism by which the intervention improved sharing discernment and highlights the potential for interventions that could reduce misinformation spread and its negative consequences.'
 'Microtubules are filamentous polymers that play a crucial role in intracellular transport. During mitosis, microtubules pull apart sister chromatids by shortening while remaining attached to kinetochores. The conformational wave hypothesis suggests that force generation during this process requires that protofilaments curl outward from the disassembling tips. In this study, the authors directly measured the working strokes generated by curling protofilaments and found that magnesium increases the mechanical energy output. They also found that yeast microtubules generate larger and more energetic working strokes than bovine microtubules. Both the magnesium and species-dependent increases in work output can be explained by lengthening the protofilament curls without changing their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. These observations demonstrate how work output from curling protofilaments can be tuned and suggest evolutionary conservation of the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubule lattice.'
 'Hagfishes are a group of jawless vertebrates that produce a unique type of slime when attacked by predators. The slime is composed of long threads that expand rapidly to trap and entangle the predator. The origin of these threads is unknown, but a recent study found that hagfish skin contains thread-producing cells that are similar to the cells that produce the slime threads. The study also found that the threads produced by these cells are shorter than the slime threads, but they are still strong and fibrous. When the skin of a hagfish is damaged, the threads are released and form an adhesive slime that is similar to the defensive slime produced when the animal is attacked. The study also found that the genes that encode the proteins that make up the threads are closely related to the genes that encode the proteins that make up the slime threads. This suggests that the slime threads may have evolved from the threads produced by the cells in the hagfish skin. The study provides new insights into the evolution of the unique slime produced by hagfishes and the cells that produce it.'
 'There are no pharmacological disease-modifying treatments with an enduring effect to mitigate the seizures and comorbidities of established chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study aimed to evaluate for disease modifying effects of sodium selenate treatment in the chronically epileptic rat post-status epilepticus (SE) model of drug-resistant TLE. Wistar rats underwent kainic acid-induced SE or sham. Ten-weeks post-SE, animals received sodium selenate, levetiracetam, or vehicle subcutaneous infusion continuously for 4 weeks. To evaluate the effects of the treatments, one week of continuous video-EEG was acquired before, during, and 4, 8 weeks post-treatment cessation, followed by behavioral tests. Targeted and untargeted proteomics and metabolomics were performed on post-mortem brain tissue to identify potential pathways associated with modified disease outcomes. The results showed that sodium selenate treatment was associated with mitigation of measures of disease severity at 8 weeks post-treatment cessation; reducing the number of spontaneous seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and sensorimotor deficits. Moreover, selenate treatment was associated with increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau, and reversed telomere length shortening. Network medicine integration of multi-omics/pre-clinical outcomes identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with TLE. Our results provide evidence that treatment with sodium selenate results in a sustained disease-modifying effect in chronically epileptic rats in the post-KA SE model of TLE, including improved comorbid learning and memory deficits.'
 'Fragility fractures are a direct consequence of osteoporosis and are associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, mortality is not part of doctor-patient communication about treatment or risk assessment. In this study, the authors introduce a new concept called "Skeletal Age" to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual. They used the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register to analyze the relationship between fracture and mortality and then translated this relationship into Skeletal Age for each fracture site. The authors found that a fracture was associated with between 1 and 7 years of life lost, with the loss being greater in men than women. They also found that hip fractures incurred the greatest loss of life years. The authors propose Skeletal Age as a new metric to assess the impact of a fragility fracture on an individual's life expectancy. This approach will enhance doctor-patient risk communication about the risks associated with osteoporosis.'
 'Brain tissue extraction is a crucial step in analyzing brain structure and function using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data. However, there is no generalizable method for extracting brain tissue across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. Therefore, a team of researchers has developed a new deep learning-based method called the Brain Extraction Net ( BEN ) to extract brain tissue across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. The BEN method has been evaluated on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six MR scanners with various magnetic field strengths. The BEN method outperforms conventional toolboxes and is designed as an open-source software to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications. The BEN method is a flexible and generalizable tool that can be used to extract brain tissue from MRI data across different species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners, and it is also considerably faster than using a traditional toolbox. The BEN method also incorporates an uncertainty-based assessment module that allows it to autonomously control the quality of brain segmentation mask outputs. This new method will reduce intra- and interrater variability while also dramatically increasing throughput for the labor-intensive brain extraction task, hence facilitating many neuroimaging studies.'
 'Candida albicans is a fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in humans. To survive in the host environment, C. albicans must acquire iron from various sources, including heme. Heme is a molecule that serves as a cellular cofactor almost universally across life. C. albicans expresses a family of GPI-anchored and soluble extracellular hemophores containing a heme-binding CFEM domain to capture heme from host proteins and transfer it across the cell wall to the cell membrane, to be endocytosed and utilized as heme or iron source. In this study, the authors identified two ferric reductase (FRE)-related proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, that lack an extracellular N-terminal substrate-binding domain, as being required for hemoglobin heme utilization and for sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. Frp1 and Frp2 redistribute to the plasma membrane in the presence of hemin, consistent with a direct role in heme trafficking. The authors conclude that Frp1/2 and the CFEM hemophores form a functional complex that evolved from FREs to enable extracellular heme uptake. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of heme acquisition in C. albicans and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating fungal infections.'
 'The Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae causes the diarrheal disease cholera, which is a major global health threat. The bacterium can survive in a variety of environments, including the human gut, by adapting to changing conditions. One way it does this is through sensory proteins that react to environmental stimuli. ToxR and ToxS are two sensory proteins that are important for Vibrio cholerae to survive in the human gut. The crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS has been determined, and it has been shown that ToxS is the main environmental sensor in Vibrio cholerae. The ToxRS complex has a bile binding pocket that is only properly built via stabilization by newly formed structural elements of ToxR. The bile binding ToxRSp complex has been determined through multiple interaction experiments and extensive molecular dynamic simulations. The ToxRS complex shows structural and functional similarities with bile sensing complex VtrAC from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, supporting a common superfamily of co-component signal transduction systems. The structure of ToxS is conserved across different Vibrio species, while ToxR exhibits structural variability among different Vibrio strains. These findings provide insight into how Vibrio cholerae adapts to changing environments and may lead to new ways to treat cholera.'
The hippocampus is a key brain structure involved in memory formation and consolidation. Recent studies have highlighted functional differences along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. In this study, the authors used track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior–posterior axis of the in vivo human hippocampus. They first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, they characterized where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Their results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, their results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in vivo and inform our understanding of the neural architecture that underpins hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.
 'Inflammation is a major driver of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a key player in the innate immune response to viral pathogens and self-DNA. STING binds to TBK1, which is mutated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To test whether STING activation is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration, researchers used a mouse model with heterozygous expression of the constitutively active STING variant N153S. They found that STING activation led to neuroinflammation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which project from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum. The researchers also observed alpha-synuclein pathology in the STING N153S mice. To determine which downstream signaling pathways contribute to STING-induced neurodegeneration, they used mice deficient for type I IFN receptor or caspase 1. The results suggest that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and that targeting the STING pathway could be beneficial in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.'
 'Immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat cancer, but it often fails to eradicate tumors. A new study has identified a previously unknown resistance mechanism that enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity. The researchers found that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique transient cell-in-cell structures, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this cell-in-cell formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells remain intact and disseminate into single tumor cells once T cells are no longer present. This formation is mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells, which subsequently induce phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT3 and EGR-1 in tumor cells. Inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. Overall, this work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism that enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity.'
The study explored how marmosets process animations featuring simple geometric shapes by examining gaze patterns and brain activations of marmosets and humans as they observed these animations. The study revealed that both marmosets and humans exhibited longer fixations on one of the triangles in ToM animations, compared to other conditions. However, the study did not observe the same pattern of longer overall fixation duration on the ToM animations in marmosets as identified in humans. Furthermore, the study found that both species activated extensive and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM versus Random animations, suggesting that marmosets differentiate between these scenarios similarly to humans. While marmosets did not mimic human overall fixation patterns, their gaze behavior and neural activations indicate a distinction between ToM and non-ToM scenarios. The study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities, shedding light on potential similarities and differences in ToM processing between marmosets and humans.
 'Expression of genes that promote stemness or differentiation must be properly controlled in stem cells to allow their progeny to transition through various intermediate stages of cell fate specification in a timely fashion. Fine-tuning of gene transcription is important for this regulation, but it is challenging to study due to the compensatory effect of translational control. The authors used the intermediate neural progenitor ( INP ) identity commitment in fly neuroblasts to define the mechanisms that fine-tune stemness gene transcription. They found that the transcription factor FruitlessC ( FruC ) binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in neuroblasts. Loss of fruC function alone has no effect on INP commitment, but it drives INP dedifferentiation when translational control is reduced. FruC negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. The authors propose that low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.'
 'Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs naturally in the body to remove damaged or old cells. However, if apoptotic cells are not removed efficiently, they can accumulate and cause inflammation or autoimmune diseases. It is widely believed that professional phagocytes, such as macrophages, are responsible for clearing apoptotic cells. However, a new study has found that neutrophils, a type of professional phagocyte, are the predominant phagocyte responsible for clearing apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver. Neutrophils burrow directly into apoptotic hepatocytes and ingest them from the inside, a process called perforocytosis. The study found that neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes is an immunologically silent mechanism that helps maintain tissue homeostasis. Defects in this process have been observed in human autoimmune liver disease. The study suggests that neutrophils can function as housekeepers for apoptotic clearance and help maintain tissue homeostasis. The findings of this study have important implications for the treatment of autoimmune liver diseases.'
 'Motor neurons are specialized nerve cells that control the movement of muscles. These neurons are regulated by other nerve cells called interneurons, which are located within the spinal cord. The way that interneurons are organized in the spinal cord is thought to help the spinal cord process motor instructions. However, a recent study found that interneurons that control different muscles are not organized in separate regions of the spinal cord. Instead, these interneurons are mixed together. This means that the spinal cord does not have separate regions for controlling different muscles. This finding challenges our understanding of how the spinal cord processes motor instructions.'
 'Respiration can affect the BOLD signal in resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) in two ways: slow respiration variations and fast cyclic changes. Slowly varying changes in breathing rate and depth covary with arterial CO2 and affect the BOLD signal via vasodilatory effects and/or autonomic influences of the vessel tone. Fast respiratory cycles induce changes in the static magnetic field, which in turn lead to BOLD signal changes. In addition to these well-characterized respiration-related non-neural artifacts, there is evidence suggesting a possible neural component in the respiration–rsfMRI interaction. Respiration can directly drive brain-wide neuronal oscillations and affect arousal and/or emotion-related brain state changes. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between respiration, neuronal activity, and rsfMRI signal, here we simultaneously acquired rsfMRI, electrophysiology, and respiration data in anesthetized rats. Based on these measures, an RVT-correlated rsfMRI network was identified. Importantly, regressing out gamma activity or silencing neural activity across the brain disrupted this respiration-related network, suggesting that this respiration–rsfMRI relationship is mediated by neural activity.'
 'Predators that hunt multiple prey types often switch between them depending on their availability and profitability. In this study, researchers used biologging tags and DNA metabarcoding of feces to investigate how greater mouse-eared bats switch between two foraging strategies in response to changing prey availability and environmental conditions. The bats primarily gleaned ground-dwelling insects, but occasionally hawked aerial insects. The researchers found that the bats used two foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures of 25 small, aerial insects and 29 large, ground-dwelling insects per bat, but with much higher capture success in the air (76%) vs ground (30%). Despite the 3-20 times larger ground prey, 85% of the nightly food acquisition came from ground prey due to the 2.5 times higher failure rates. The researchers concluded that the bats used high risk-high gain gleaning of ground prey as a primary foraging tactic, but switched to aerial hunting when environmental changes reduced the profitability of ground prey. This study highlights the importance of prey switching in maintaining energy intake even in specialized predators.'
 'The evolution of human right-handedness has been a topic of debate for decades. Researchers have studied the hand preferences of different primate species to try to understand why humans are so strongly right-handed. However, previous studies have been limited by small sample sizes and inconsistent methods. In this study, the authors combined data from 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans, to test different hypotheses about the evolution of primate handedness. They found that human right-handedness is an extreme among anthropoids and that species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates. However, the authors also found that hand preference strength, or the degree to which an individual prefers one hand over the other, varies widely among primates. They suggest that this variation in hand preference strength may be related to ecological factors, such as whether a species is arboreal or terrestrial. The authors also found that the strength of hand preference is positively correlated with brain size, which is consistent with previous research. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of primate handedness and suggests that a combination of ecological and neuroanatomical factors may have played a role in shaping human right-handedness.'
 'Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and heart. It causes mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and a hypersocial phenotype. There are currently no treatments for WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a signaling system that plays a role in both cognitive and cardiovascular function. In this study, researchers analyzed the components of the ECS in a mouse model of WBS and found that the ECS could be a potential target for treatment. They found that a drug called JZL184, which inhibits the enzyme that breaks down one of the main endocannabinoids, improved key phenotypic alterations in WBS mice, including their social and cognitive behavior and cardiovascular function. These results suggest that the ECS could be a promising new target for treating WBS.
 'During development, animals transition through different stages characterized by distinct morphological and molecular changes. In humans, for example, development progresses from childhood through puberty and then to adulthood when sexual maturity is attained. Similarly, in holometabolous insects, immature juveniles transit to the adult form through an intermediate pupal stage when larval tissues are eliminated and the imaginal progenitor cells form the adult structures. The identity of the larval, pupal, and adult stages depends on the sequential expression of the transcription factors chinmo, Br-C, and E93. However, how these transcription factors determine temporal identity in developing tissues is poorly understood. Here, we report on the role of the larval specifier chinmo in larval and adult progenitor cells during fly development. We found that chinmo promotes growth in larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. In addition, we found that the absence of chinmo during metamorphosis is critical for proper adult differentiation. Importantly, we also provide evidence that, in contrast to the well-known role of chinmo as a pro-oncogene, Br-C and E93 act as tumour suppressors. Finally, we reveal that the function of chinmo as a juvenile specifier is conserved in hemimetabolous insects as its homolog has a similar role in Blatella germanica. Taken together, our results suggest that the sequential expression of the transcription factors Chinmo, Br-C, and E93 during larva, pupa, and adult, respectively, coordinate the formation of the different organs that constitute the adult organism.'
 'Metabolism is a complex system of reactions and enzymes that work together to produce energy and maintain cellular processes. The dynamics of metabolism are influenced by many factors, including the levels of co-substrates, which are molecules that are converted among alternate forms via different reactions. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical framework to analyze the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux. They found that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct to the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalyzing that reaction. The authors used analytical methods to show that this additional limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. They also used simulations to show that regulation of these two parameters can allow regulation of flux dynamics in branched and coupled pathways. The authors analyzed existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from the central carbon metabolism and identified several reactions that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. They concluded that measuring and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells.'
 'Articular cartilage is a specialized tissue that covers the ends of bones in joints, allowing for smooth movement. The cells that make up this tissue, called chondrocytes, are generated from a group of progenitor cells during development. However, the origin and differentiation mechanism of these progenitor cells are not well understood. In this study, the authors identified a protein called NFATc1 as a crucial regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation during development. They found that NFATc1-expressing cells were mainly located in the flanking region of the joint interzone at the early stage of mouse knee development and generated almost all articular chondrocytes but not chondrocytes in limb growth-plate primordium. NFATc1-expressing cells displayed prominent capacities for colony formation and multipotent differentiation. Transcriptome analyses revealed a set of characteristic genes in NFATc1-enriched articular cartilage progenitors. Strikingly, the expression of NFATc1 was diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppressing NFATc1 expression in articular cartilage progenitors was sufficient to induce spontaneous chondrogenesis while overexpressing NFATc1 suppresses chondrogenesis. Mechanistically, NFATc1 negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of the Col2a1 gene. Thus, the authors suggest that NFATc1 characterizes articular, but not growth-plate, cartilage progenitors during development and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation at least partly through regulating COL2A1 gene transcription.'
 'Photosystem II (PSII) is a key enzyme in oxygenic photosynthesis that uses light energy to convert water into oxygen and reduce plastoquinone. PSII can use different pigments to perform this reaction, including chlorophyll d (Chl-d) and chlorophyll f (Chl-f). Chl-d-PSII uses less energy than Chl-a-PSII, but it is less efficient and more sensitive to photodamage. Chl-f-PSII uses even less energy than Chl-d-PSII, but it is more efficient and resilient to photodamage. The authors compared the enzyme turnover efficiency, forward reactions, and back-reactions in Chl-a-PSII, Chl-d-PSII, and Chl-f-PSII. They found that Chl-a-PSII is the most efficient, Chl-d-PSII is less efficient but more resilient to photodamage, and Chl-f-PSII is the least efficient but most resilient to photodamage. The authors suggest that the differences in energy usage and photodamage resistance are due to the different pigments used and the layout of the pigments in the PSII complex. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of photosynthesis and for engineering photosynthesis in other organisms.'
 'The skeletal system is a complex organ that plays a crucial role in movement, support, hematopoiesis, immune responses, and endocrine regulation. The skeletal system is made up of various cell lineages that arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These cell lineages are responsible for the maintenance of bone and bone marrow homeostasis. Osteocytes, the long-living terminally differentiated cells that reside within the bone matrix, play a vital role in maintaining the skeletal homeostasis. In this study, the authors used a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes to investigate their role in regulating lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow. They found that partial ablation of osteocytes caused severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan in these animals. Osteocyte reduction altered mesenchymal lineage commitment, resulting in impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed that hematopoietic lineage was mobilized toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes, while the lymphopoiesis was impaired with reduced B cells in the osteocyte ablation mice. The acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells was the underlying cause. Together, the authors showed that osteocytes play critical roles in regulation of lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow through mediation of senescence.'
 'Organisms can adapt to their environment by taking multiple different paths. This can make it difficult to understand the molecular mechanisms behind complex adaptations. To address this challenge, researchers used the Escherichia coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) as a model. They characterized the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across 12 replicate populations evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations. They found that all evolved lines had more mRNAs and that this increase in mRNA abundance scaled with cell size. They also found that despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations in the LTEE were remarkably similar in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The majority of the expression changes were due to changes at the transcriptional level, with very few translational changes. Finally, they showed how mutations in transcriptional regulators led to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.'
 'Liver regeneration is a complex process that involves the activation of various signaling pathways and the recruitment of stem cells. However, the exact mechanism of liver regeneration is still not fully understood. In this study, the authors found that hepatocytes in Shp2-deficient mice form clusters and express CD133, a marker of stem cells. These CD133+ cells were able to divide and contribute to liver regeneration. The authors also found that CD133+ cells migrate between cells and exchange mRNAs, which may help to compensate for the lack of proliferative signaling. These findings suggest a new role for CD133+ cells in liver regeneration and may help to develop new therapies for liver diseases.'
 'Ciliopathies are a group of diseases that affect the primary cilium, a microtubule-based organelle found in most cells. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision loss, kidney dysfunction, and brain malformation. Retinal ciliopathies are a subtype of ciliopathies that specifically affect the retina. One of the most common types of retinal ciliopathies is Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 (LCA10), which is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. CEP290 is a large protein that is important for the structure and function of the primary cilium. In this study, the authors used retinal organoids, which are three-dimensional structures made from induced pluripotent stem cells that can be used to model human diseases, to screen for drugs that could help treat LCA10. They found that the drug reserpine was effective at improving photoreceptor survival in both mouse and human retinal organoids. The authors also found that reserpine improved the balance between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is important for maintaining proteostasis in the retina. Overall, this study provides a promising new drug candidate for treating LCA10 and highlights the importance of using retinal organoids for drug discovery in retinal ciliopathies.'
 'Bees are exposed to a variety of plant metabolites while foraging, including amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in almonds. While amygdalin is not toxic to bees at low concentrations, it can be converted into hydrogen cyanide, which is toxic. Bees may rely on their gut microbiota to degrade amygdalin and reduce the risk of hydrogen cyanide toxicity. In this study, the authors found that amygdalin can be degraded by both bees and members of their gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In microbiota-colonized bees, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut. The authors found that prunasin accumulation in microbiota-deprived bees is due to the inability of the bee gut microbiota to further degrade prunasin. The authors also found that some strains of Bifidobacterium, a dominant bee gut bacterial species, can degrade amygdalin and prunasin. The authors used in vitro experiments to demonstrate that amygdalin degradation by bee gut bacteria is strain-specific and not characteristic of a particular genus or species. They also found that amygdalin degradation by Bifidobacterium wkB204, a strain that fully degrades amygdalin into hydrogen cyanide, is due to overexpression and secretion of several carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, including one in glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3). The authors suggest that bees and their gut microbiota work together to metabolize dietary plant metabolites, including amygdalin.'
 'Candida albicans is a fungus that can cause severe invasive candidiasis in humans. This infection is caused by a virulence factor called candidalysin (CL), which damages the membranes of target cells. However, the mechanism by which CL damages membranes is not well understood. In this study, the authors used a variety of biophysical techniques to investigate the mechanism of CL pore formation. They found that CL forms polymers in solution, which then insert into the membrane to become pores. The authors propose that this polymerization is a necessary step for CL to damage membranes. They also found that CL pores can have different structures, which may represent a maturation mechanism that stabilizes pore formation. The authors suggest that targeting CL polymerization could be a new therapeutic approach to treat candidiasis.'
700 words. The study aimed to investigate whether presenting a placebo analgesia machine as personalised would improve its effectiveness. The study recruited 102 adults in two samples ( N1=17 , N2=85 ) to receive painful heat stimulations on their forearm. During half of the stimulations, a machine purportedly delivered an electric current to reduce their pain. Participants were either told that the machine was personalised to their genetics and physiology, or that it was effective in reducing pain generally. Participants told that the machine was personalised reported more relief in pain intensity than the control group in both the feasibility study ( standardised β=−0 . 50 [–1 . 08 , 0 . 08] ) and the pre-registered double-blind confirmatory study ( β=−0 . 20 [–0 . 36 , –0 . 04] ). The study found similar effects on pain unpleasantness, and several personality traits moderated the results. The findings suggest that framing a sham treatment as personalised increases its effectiveness. The study highlights the importance of contextual factors in precision medicine research and practice. The study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council ( 93188 ) and Genome Québec ( 95747 ).
 'Shared lineage has diverse effects on patterns of neuronal connectivity. In mammalian cortex, excitatory sister neurons assemble into shared microcircuits. In Drosophila, in contrast, sister neurons with different levels of Notch expression (NotchON/NotchOFF) develop distinct identities and diverge into separate circuits. Notch-differentiated sister neurons have been observed in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but whether they integrate into shared or distinct circuits remains unknown. Here, we evaluate how sister V2a (NotchOFF) /V2b (NotchON) neurons in the zebrafish integrate into spinal circuits. Using an in vivo labeling approach, we identified pairs of sister V2a/b neurons born from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and observed that they have somata in close proximity to each other and similar axonal trajectories. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics revealed that sister V2a/b neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. These results resemble the divergent connectivity in Drosophila and represent the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.'
 'Neuronal networks are made up of many cells that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. These networks are able to adapt to changes in their environment or activity levels, a process known as homeostatic plasticity. However, sometimes homeostatic plasticity can become too strong and cause problems, such as seizures. In this study, the authors found that a group of transcription factors called PARbZIPs help to regulate homeostatic plasticity in the brain. They found that when these transcription factors are removed, the brain's response to changes in activity is much stronger, and can even cause seizures. The authors also found that these transcription factors help to control the strength of connections between neurons in the brain. This study provides important insights into how the brain is able to adapt to changes in its environment and how these adaptations can be controlled to prevent problems.'
 'The lung is a complex organ that develops from a simple bud in the embryo. The tips of this bud are home to important progenitor cells that give rise to all types of lung cells. These progenitor cells are marked by the expression of two genes, Sox9 and Id2. Early in development, these progenitor cells can make either airway or alveolar cells, but later in development, they only make alveolar cells. Transcription factors and signaling pathways control the development and differentiation of these progenitor cells. However, it is not well understood how these factors control the chromatin state to establish and maintain cell identity. In this study, researchers used paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from Sox9+ progenitor cells during embryonic development in mice. They found widespread changes in chromatin accessibility, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements. They also identified a common regulatory network that included the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mice resulted in an expansion of the Sox9+ progenitor cell population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation. These data demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis and emphasize the combinatorial power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development.'
 'Working memory ( WM ) is a cognitive domain that is often affected in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The slot model of WM, which assumes that WM is a limited storage system for a fixed number of items, has been widely used to study WM in MS. However, recent studies have shown that the resource-based model, which assumes that WM is a dynamic system with a continuous allocation of resources, may be a better fit for WM assessment in MS. In this study, two continuous reproduction paradigms, memory-guided localization ( MGL ) and analog recall task with sequential presentation, were used to investigate WM dysfunction in MS. The results showed an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS, and that the sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy controls from relapsing-remitting MS, while the MGL paradigm was more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes. Furthermore, computational modeling of the results from the sequential paradigm determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error ( mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items ) were responsible for WM dysfunction in MS. Overall, this study provided new insights into the organization of the WM system in MS population and offered a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit.'
 'Nociception is a neural process that animals have developed to avoid potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. While nociception is triggered in the peripheral nervous system, its modulation by the central nervous system is a critical process in mammals, whose dysfunction has been extensively implicated in chronic pain pathogenesis. The peripheral mechanisms of nociception are largely conserved across the animal kingdom. However, it is unclear whether the brain-mediated modulation is also conserved in non-mammalian species. Here, we show that Drosophila has a descending inhibitory mechanism of nociception from the brain, mediated by the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) that plays an important role in the descending control of nociception in mammals. We found that mutants lacking dsk or its receptors are hypersensitive to noxious heat. Through a combination of genetic, behavioral, histological, and Ca2+ imaging analyses, we subsequently revealed neurons involved in DSK-mediated nociceptive regulation at a single-cell resolution and identified a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system, raising the possibility that the descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception.'
 'Plants often produce secondary metabolites as defense mechanisms against parasites. However, some fungi may be able to overcome these barriers through various mechanisms. In this study, the authors found an Aglaia plant-parasitizing fungus that overcomes the toxicity of rocaglates, which are translation inhibitors synthesized by the plant, through an amino acid substitution in a eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) . The authors used de novo transcriptome assembly and ribosome profiling to reveal that the fungus belongs to the Ophiocordyceps genus and that its eIF4A, a molecular target of rocaglates, harbors an amino acid substitution critical for rocaglate binding. The engineered C. orbiculare showed a survival advantage on cucumber plants with rocaglates. The study exemplifies a plant–fungus tug-of-war centered on secondary metabolites produced by host plants.'
 'Psychophysical methods are used to measure human perception and behavior. They typically involve presenting stimuli and recording binary responses. However, this approach has limitations, such as the need for many trials and highly trained participants. Continuous psychophysics is a new approach that involves tracking a stimulus in real-time and analyzing the data using Bayesian methods. This approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional psychophysical methods. However, current analysis methods do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task. In this study, the authors introduce a new analysis framework for continuous psychophysics based on Bayesian inverse optimal control. They show that this framework can recover perceptual thresholds and estimate subjects' action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. The authors provide evidence for the importance of including acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and the intrinsic costs of behavior in even experiments seemingly only investigating perception. The study provides a new tool for analyzing continuous psychophysical data and sheds light on the importance of considering the entirety of the task when measuring perception and behavior.'
 'How do we make decisions when the world around us is constantly changing? Researchers have developed models to understand how the brain makes decisions under stable conditions, but these models may not be applicable to real-world scenarios. In this study, the authors developed a new model that takes into account changing contexts, such as changes in evidence quality or reward, during the course of a single decision. They found that optimal decision rules involve non-trivial, time-dependent changes in decision thresholds that adapt to and even anticipate these changes. These rules outperform heuristic models and provide a better account of human behavior on a task with time-varying evidence quality and average reward. The results of this study provide new insights into the behavioral relevance of adaptive decision thresholds in dynamic environments and link the details of environmental changes to threshold adaptations.'
100 years of community-level biodiversity, climate change, and chemical pollution trends in a freshwater ecosystem were analyzed using explainable network models with multimodal learning. The study found that insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. The community-level biodiversity approach used here reliably explained freshwater ecosystem shifts. These shifts were not observed when using traditional quality indices. The study advocates the use of high-throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends over species-focused ecological surveys to identify the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions.
 'Responding quickly to the world around us is a primary function of the central nervous system. However, the brain only has access to outdated sensory information due to the time required for neural transmission and processing. In motion perception, the brain may overcome these delays through predictively encoding the position of moving objects using information from their past trajectories. In the present study, researchers used multivariate analysis of high temporal resolution electroencephalographic data to track neural position representations of moving objects at different stages of visual processing, relative to the real-time position of the object. During early stimulus-evoked activity, position representations of moving objects were activated substantially earlier than the equivalent activity evoked by unpredictable flashes, aligning the earliest representations of moving stimuli with their real-time positions. These findings indicate that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for the neural delays accumulated early in stimulus processing, but that delays still accumulate across later stages of cortical processing. The study provides the first direct evidence in humans that extrapolation processes allow the early visual system to localise moving objects in real time. However, the study also suggests that subsequent cortical visual areas do not implement further compensation for neural delays. These findings demonstrate the existence of significant predictive processing during motion perception, but constrain any predictive mechanisms to acting relatively early in processing.'
 'The human brain is capable of storing and retrieving knowledge from language inputs, in addition to nonlinguistic sensory channels such as vision and touch. How does language experience modulate the mechanism by which semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain? In this study, the authors investigated this question using a unique human model with varying amounts and qualities of early language exposure. They compared the neural semantic structures between congenitally deaf signers with delayed sign language acquisition (delayed deaf signers) and congenitally deaf signers with native sign language acquisition (native deaf signers), that are matched on nonlinguistic sensory experiences but varied in early language experience. The results provide positive, causal evidence that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL), highlighting the roles of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences. The study provides important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying language-derived knowledge.'
1. The hippocampus is important for memory processing and place cells are activated in a specific order during behavioral episodes. 2. Replay is a phenomenon where place cells reactivate the same order of place fields during offline periods. 3. Place cells also carry information about the magnitude of their place field's activity (rate representation) which is modulated by contextual cues and behavioral variables. 4. Replay events may also be capable of representing information using firing rate. 5. The authors show that dorsal CA1 place cells in rats can modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts. 6. This phenomenon mirrors the same pattern of rate modulation observed during behavior and can be used independently from place information within replay sequences to discriminate between contexts. 7. The results reveal the existence of two complementary neural representations available for memory processes.
 'Mitochondria are important organelles in the cell that produce energy and play a role in other cellular processes. However, sometimes mitochondria can become damaged and not work properly. This can lead to a range of diseases, including infertility. In this study, researchers looked at the effects of a protein called PARL on spermatogenesis, which is the process by which sperm are made in the testicles. They found that PARL-deficient mice had early testicular atrophy and a complete arrest of spermatogenesis during meiotic prophase I. This process was independent of neurodegeneration. The researchers also found severe abnormalities in mitochondrial ultrastructure and electron transfer chain defects in PARL-deficient spermatocytes. These mitochondrial defects were associated with a germ cell-specific decrease in GPX4 expression leading to arrested spermatocytes undergoing ferroptosis, a regulated cell death modality characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. The researchers suggest that mitochondrial defects induced by PARL depletion act as an initiating trigger for ferroptosis in primary spermatocytes through simultaneous effects on GPX4 and CoQ, two major inhibitors of ferroptosis. These findings shed new light on the potential role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and male infertility. The study provides new insights into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in male infertility and paves the way for further investigations on this cell death mechanism in mitochondrial diseases.'
 'The liver is a vital organ that plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism. However, when the liver becomes damaged or diseased, it can lead to serious health problems. One such disease is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by the buildup of fat in the liver and inflammation. Researchers have been looking for ways to treat NASH, and they have found that a protein called fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) may be a promising candidate. FGF21 is a hormone that is produced by the liver and helps to regulate metabolism. In a recent study, researchers found that overexpressing FGF21 in the liver of mice fed a high-fat diet prevented liver damage and inflammation. They also found that FGF21 helped to reduce the number of macrophages in the liver, which are cells that contribute to inflammation. Overall, the study suggests that FGF21 may be a useful treatment for NASH.'
 'The brain is a complex organ that controls many of our body's functions. To understand how it works, scientists study the activity of neurons, which are specialized cells that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. To do this, they use a variety of techniques, such as recording the activity of neurons in the brain or measuring the electrical activity of the brain itself. However, these techniques produce a lot of data that can be difficult to analyze and share. To address this problem, researchers have developed a standard language for describing neurophysiology data called NWB. This language allows scientists to describe the data they collect in a way that is easy for other scientists to understand and use. NWB also makes it possible to combine data from different experiments and species, which can help researchers to better understand how the brain works. The NWB language is part of a larger ecosystem of tools and resources that make it easier for scientists to share and analyze neurophysiology data. This ecosystem includes tools for storing, analyzing, and visualizing the data, as well as software for sharing the data with other scientists. Overall, the NWB language and ecosystem are helping to make neuroscience research more efficient, collaborative, and reproducible.'
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) causes respiratory tract disease and can lead to neurological consequences such as encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. The mechanisms behind these neurological changes are unknown. To gain insight into the neuronal and non-neuronal molecular changes during an IAV infection, the authors intranasally infected mice with an H1N1 virus and extracted the brain at different time points. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the hypothalamus, they identified transcriptional effects in all identified cell populations. The snRNA-seq data showed the most pronounced transcriptional response at 3 days past infection, with a strong downregulation of genes across all cell types. General immune processes were mainly impacted in microglia, the brain resident immune cells, where the authors found increased numbers of cells expressing pro-inflammatory gene networks. In addition, they found that most neuronal cell populations downregulated genes contributing to the energy homeostasis in mitochondria and protein translation in the cytosol, indicating potential reduced cellular and neuronal activity. This might be a preventive mechanism in neuronal cells to avoid intracellular viral replication and attack by phagocytosing cells. The change of microglia gene activity suggests that this is complemented by a shift in microglia activity to provide increased surveillance of their surroundings. The authors conclude that their study provides a better understanding of the direct and indirect effects of IAV infection on the brain and highlights the importance of studying non-neuronal cells in the context of neurological diseases.'
 'Apical–basal cell polarity is a key regulator of epithelial tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression of cells in the follicular epithelium of Drosophila ovaries that have lost apical–basal polarity due to the knockdown of the polarity gene Lgl. They found that these cells have distinct gene expression profiles and that the oxidative stress-responsive Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway is enriched in the cells that have undergone invasive multilayering. The authors also found that manipulating the expression of Keap1 and Nrf2 can regulate the invasiveness of these cells and their cytoskeletal organization. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of cells with polarity loss and identifies novel regulatory pathways that determine plasticity in the invading tumor.'
 'Humans learn about the environment by interacting with it or by seeking information about it from other people. The degree of confidence in the information obtained from either source should determine its impact on adapting and changing behavior. In this study, the authors examined whether and how behavioral and neural computations differ during non-social learning as opposed to learning from social sources. They found that confidence judgments were more accurate and less changeable when they were made about social as opposed to non-social information sources. In addition, the authors found that univariate activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction more closely tracked confidence about social as opposed to non-social information sources. Furthermore, the multivariate patterns of activity in the same areas encoded the identities of social information sources compared to non-social information sources. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms that support learning from social advice are at least partially specialized and distinct from those concerned with learning that is guided by non-social sources.'
'Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that allow neurons to communicate with each other. When a neuron is activated, it releases neurotransmitters from small sacs called synaptic vesicles. This process is triggered by a sudden increase in the concentration of calcium inside the cell. However, the exact mechanism by which calcium triggers neurotransmitter release is not well understood. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical model to explain how calcium and a molecule called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) work together to trigger neurotransmitter release. They found that when calcium binds to a protein called synaptotagmin, it causes the protein to bind more tightly to PI(4,5)P2. This stabilizes the protein in a conformation that is important for neurotransmitter release. The authors also found that multiple copies of synaptotagmin need to bind to PI(4,5)P2 in order for neurotransmitter release to occur. They suggest that this happens because each copy of synaptotagmin helps to stabilize the conformation of the other copies. The authors' model provides a new understanding of how calcium and PI(4,5)P2 work together to trigger neurotransmitter release.'
'The evolutionary history of marine reptiles is still incompletely understood, especially the early evolution of the sauropterygian body plan. In this study, we report a new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic of South China, representing the earliest known occurrence of the clade. We also present an updated phylogenetic analysis of diapsid reptiles, which recovers saurosphargids as nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. Our study provides evidence for the rapid diversification of sauropterygians in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event and emphasises the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa.'
 'Smoking is a major public health concern, and it has been linked to a wide range of diseases. DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression and has been linked to smoking. However, it is not clear whether DNA methylation is reactive to smoking or if it is a result of a shared genetic predisposition to smoking and DNA methylation. To address this question, researchers used data from a large study of monozygotic twins, which are genetically identical except for de novo mutations. They found that DNA methylation levels in blood cells are reactive to smoking, and that differences in smoking levels exposure for monozygotic twins who are both current smokers but differ in the number of cigarettes they smoke are reflected in their DNA methylation profiles. The researchers also found that DNA methylation levels in blood cells are reversible upon smoking cessation. These findings have important implications for understanding the relationship between smoking and DNA methylation, and for developing interventions to help people quit smoking.'
 'The retina is a complex organ that processes visual information before it is sent to the brain. Researchers have studied the retina extensively using isolated, ex vivo preparations. However, these studies do not capture the full range of retinal function in awake animals. To address this, researchers recorded the activity of retinal ganglion cells in the optic tract of head-fixed mice. They found that awake retinal output had faster kinetics, a larger dynamic range, and higher firing activity than anesthetized or ex vivo retinal output. These results suggest that the retina may employ dense coding principles in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as has been often assumed from ex vivo studies.'
 'Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) is a common technique used in biology to preserve biomolecular interactions in vivo. However, a recent study has shown that PFA fixation can alter the appearance of liquid–liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) in living cells. The study found that fixation can either enhance or diminish the appearance of LLPS, depending on the protein being studied. In some cases, fixation can even cause droplet-like puncta to artificially appear in cells that do not have any detectable puncta in the live condition. The study suggests that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein–protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and the difference between protein fixation rates in and out of droplet-like puncta. The study urges caution in the interpretation of previous claims of in vivo phase separation based solely on immunofluorescence imaging of fixed cells and serves to guide future judicious application of PFA fixation.'
 'Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). These bacteria can form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) within bladder cells, which can be difficult to treat with antibiotics. Researchers have developed a human bladder-chip model to study the formation and dynamics of IBCs. Using this model, they found that IBCs can form within hours of infection and that neutrophils, which are immune cells that fight infection, can form swarms around IBCs. However, the researchers also found that IBCs can protect bacteria from antibiotics, which can lead to recurrent UTIs. This model could be useful for studying the dynamics of UTIs and for developing new treatments.'
 'Ammonium is an essential building block of life and is assimilated by organisms through a network of enzymes. To study the flexibility of this network, researchers constructed an Escherichia coli glutamate auxotrophic strain and found that several amino acids complemented the auxotrophy either by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. In this network, researchers identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, researchers extended the transamination network by the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources and identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Finally, researchers introduced ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine. Their study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.'
 'Coral reefs are home to a diverse array of organisms, including symbiotic algae called dinoflagellates. These algae live inside the coral cells and provide them with energy through photosynthesis. However, it is not clear how the coral cells get the energy from the algae. In this study, researchers found that when the pH of the water around the coral drops, the algae release more energy in the form of sugars into the water. This energy can then be taken up by the coral cells. The researchers also found that the algae's cell wall is important for this process, and that changes in the cell wall can affect how much energy is released. This study provides new insights into how coral reefs function and how they might be affected by changes in the ocean's pH.'
 'Nephronophthisis ( NPHP ) is a rare genetic disorder that causes cysts to form in the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure. Researchers have identified 25 genes that are associated with NPHP, but the function of one of these genes, INVS, is not well understood. To better understand the function of INVS, researchers created two mouse models with different levels of INVS in the kidneys. They found that the kidneys of mice with low levels of INVS had cysts and fibrosis, which are signs of kidney damage. They also found that removing cilia from the kidneys of mice with low levels of INVS reduced the severity of the kidney damage. Finally, they found that treating the mice with a drug called valproic acid ( VPA ) reduced the severity of the kidney damage. These findings suggest that INVS plays a role in the development of cysts and fibrosis in the kidneys, and that VPA may be a potential treatment for NPHP.'
 'The extinct Steller's sea cow ( Hydrodamalis gigas; †1768 ) was a whale-sized marine mammal that lived in the North Pacific. It had a unique set of adaptations to survive in the harsh coastal climate. Researchers have now discovered that the sea cow's adult-expressed hemoglobin ( Hb; α2β/δ2 ) has a fixed amino acid replacement at an otherwise invariant position ( β/δ82Lys→Asn ) that alters multiple aspects of Hb function. The Hb-O2 affinity of this sub-Arctic species was less affected by temperature than those of living ( sub ) tropical sea cows. This phenotype presumably safeguarded O2 delivery to cool peripheral tissues and largely arises from a reduced intrinsic temperature sensitivity of the H . gigas protein. Additionally, the β/δ82Asn→Lys mutant Hb renders Steller's sea cow Hb unresponsive to the potent intraerythrocytic allosteric effector 2 , 3-diphosphoglycerate, a radical modification that is the first documented example of this phenotype among mammals. Notably, β/δ82Lys→Asn moreover underlies the secondary evolution of a reduced blood-O2 affinity phenotype that would have promoted heightened tissue and maternal/fetal O2 delivery. This conclusion is bolstered by analyses of two Steller's sea cow prenatal Hb proteins ( Hb Gower I; ζ2ε2 and HbF; α2γ2 ) that suggest an exclusive embryonic stage expression pattern, and reveal uncommon replacements in H . gigas HbF ( γ38Thr→Ile and γ101Glu→Asp ) that increased Hb-O2 affinity relative to dugong HbF. Finally, the β/δ82Lys→Asn replacement of the adult/fetal protein is shown to increase protein solubility, which may have elevated red blood cell Hb content within both the adult and fetal circulations and contributed to meeting the elevated metabolic ( thermoregulatory ) requirements and fetal growth rates associated with this species cold adaptation.'
 'Expression of activated RasV12 provides Drosophila cultured cells with a proliferation and survival advantage that simplifies the generation of continuous cell lines. Here, the authors used lineage-restricted RasV12 expression to generate continuous cell lines of muscle, glial, and epithelial cell type. Additionally, cell lines with neuronal and hemocyte characteristics were isolated by cloning from cell cultures established with broad RasV12 expression. Differentiation with the hormone ecdysone caused maturation of cells from mesoderm lines into active muscle tissue and enhanced dendritic features in neuronal-like lines. Transcriptome analysis showed expression of key cell-type-specific genes and the expected alignment with single-cell sequencing and in situ data. Overall, the technique has produced in vitro cell models with characteristics of glia, epithelium, muscle, nerve, and hemocyte. The cells and associated data are available from the Drosophila Genomic Resource Center.'
 'Multiciliated cells ( MCCs ) are specialized epithelial cells that line the surface of the respiratory tract, brain ventricles, and reproductive systems. These cells contain tens to hundreds of motile cilia that collectively beat to drive fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. To template these cilia, MCCs dramatically expand their centriole content during a process known as centriole amplification. In cycling cells, the master regulator of centriole assembly Polo-like kinase 4 ( PLK4 ) is essential for centriole duplication; however, recent work has questioned the role of PLK4 in centriole assembly in MCCs. To address this discrepancy, the authors created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Tracheal epithelial cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results show that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs and suggest that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events. The authors also show that PLK4 is required for centriole amplification in MCCs, and that centriole amplification drives an increase in apical surface area in airway MCCs. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of centriole amplification and surface area expansion in MCCs, and may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases caused by defects in motile cilia assembly or function.'
 'The human endometrium is a complex tissue that undergoes repetitive cycles of tissue wounding and repair. In this study, researchers used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic lines of mice to investigate whether epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium have their origins in one or more of the mesenchymal cell types present in the stromal compartment of the endometrium. Using scRNAseq, the researchers identified a novel population of PDGFRb + mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. To confirm their hypothesis, the researchers used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts (PDGFRa+) and stromal perivascular cells (NG2/CSPG4+). They demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons both to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response (Asherman’s syndrome, endometriosis) as well as other mucosal tissues which have a variable response to wounding.'
 'Bacteria often exist in complex communities where they must adapt to changing environmental conditions to survive. One way they do this is through a process called phase variation, which involves the reversible genetic alteration of specific regions of their DNA. This can lead to the emergence of subpopulations with different phenotypes that are better adapted to different environments. In this study, the authors identified a phase variation system in the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis that generates a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous population. They found that this system involves the recombination of two copies of a 208.6 kb region of DNA that contains 157 predicted coding sequences. This region can be amplified to two or more copies, leading to the emergence of subpopulations with different phenotypes that are better adapted to different growth conditions. The authors believe that this system represents a rare example of IS element-mediated evolution in which the IS elements provide homologous sequences for amplification of a chromosomal region that provides a selective advantage under specific growth conditions, thereby expanding the lifestyle repertoire of the species.'
 'In bacteria, the rate and accuracy of translation depend on multiple components, including tRNA pools, tRNA modifying enzymes, and rRNA molecules. These components are often redundant in terms of gene copy number or function. However, the extent to which redundancy is beneficial or detrimental to fitness is not well understood. We manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of Escherichia coli by deleting 28 tRNA genes, 3 tRNA modifying systems, and 4 rRNA operons in various combinations. We find that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful and costly under nutrient limitation. This nutrient-dependent cost of redundant tRNA genes stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. Importantly, these effects are also contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing. Overall, our results indicate both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species’ evolutionary history with feasts and famines.'
 'The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a massive amount of genomic data being collected on the virus, SARS-CoV-2. This data is typically represented as a phylogenetic tree, which captures the evolutionary history of the virus and allows for the identification of transmission events and the emergence of new variants. However, existing web-based tools for exploring these trees are not able to handle the scale of data now available for SARS-CoV-2. Taxonium is a new tool that uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser for the first time. Taxonium can be used to analyze a tree of five million sequences and provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution. A public tree of more than five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be explored at cov2tree.org. Taxonium can be applied to any tree and is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium. The tool allows for the exploration of large trees, the display of mutation-annotated trees, and the ability to search for nodes by metadata or genotype. The tool can be run entirely locally in the browser, from a server-based backend, or as a desktop application. The tool provides a new way to analyze and explore large phylogenetic trees and can be used to gain insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.'
 'RNA molecules are localized to specific subcellular regions through interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Generally, our knowledge of the mechanistic details behind the localization of a given RNA is restricted to a particular cell type. Here, the authors show that RNA/RBP interactions that regulate RNA localization in one cell type predictably regulate localization in other cell types with vastly different morphologies. To determine transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells, the authors used their recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique, Halo-seq. They found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RP mRNAs) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. Using reporter transcripts and single-molecule RNA FISH, the authors found that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5′ UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. In both cell types, the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the 5′ UTR of the transcript, was abolished upon perturbation of the RNA-binding protein LARP1, and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-1. To extend these findings, the authors compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells. They found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator, and demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms cut across cell morphologies.'
 'Aging is a complex process that involves many changes at the cellular level. One of the most common changes is an increase in transcriptional noise, which refers to the variation in gene expression among cells that are supposed to be identical. However, the methods used to measure transcriptional noise have varied widely, making it difficult to compare results across studies. In this study, we developed a Python toolkit called Decibel that implements four commonly used methods for measuring transcriptional noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. We also developed a novel method called Scallop that measures the membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. We applied these tools to seven aging datasets from different tissues and species, and found that the increase in transcriptional noise associated with aging is not universal. Instead, we found that age-associated changes in cell type composition are more consistent across tissues and species. Our results suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated. '
 'Tumor heterogeneity' refers to the fact that tumors are made up of many different types of cells, each with its own unique genetic makeup. This heterogeneity can make it difficult to treat tumors effectively, as some cells may be resistant to certain treatments. In this study, the authors used a new technique called 'clonal transcriptomics' to study the genetic makeup of different cells within a tumor. They found that some cells within a tumor were resistant to a type of chemotherapy called taxane-based chemotherapy because they had high levels of a protein called NRF2. The authors also found that these taxane-resistant cells were sensitive to a different type of treatment called asparagine deprivation therapy. This means that if a patient's tumor is resistant to taxane-based chemotherapy, they may be sensitive to asparagine deprivation therapy. The authors hope that this information will help doctors develop more effective treatments for patients with tumors that are resistant to certain types of chemotherapy.
46, XY DSD is a rare genetic disorder in which individuals have a Y chromosome but develop female reproductive organs. DMRT1 is a gene that is important for testis development in some species of vertebrates, but its role in mammals is unclear. In this study, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a DMRT1 knockout in rabbits. They found that DMRT1 is required for testis development in rabbits, and that DMRT1 knockout leads to male-to-female sex reversal in rabbits. The study also found that DMRT1 is required for female fertility in rabbits. These findings suggest that DMRT1 may play a role in human 46, XY DSD and may be a target for treatment.
 'Obesity is a major health problem worldwide, and it is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model for studying obesity and its related diseases. CTPS is an important enzyme for the de novo synthesis of CTP, which governs the cellular level of CTP and the rate of phospholipid synthesis. CTPS forms filamentous structures called cytoophidia, which are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Our study demonstrates that CTPS is crucial in regulating body weight and starvation resistance in Drosophila by functioning in the fat body. HFD-induced obesity leads to increased transcription of CTPS and elongates cytoophidia in larval adipocytes. Depleting CTPS in the fat body prevents HFD-induced obesity, including body weight gain, adipocyte expansion, and lipid accumulation, by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis. These findings not only establish a functional link between CTPS and lipid homeostasis but also highlight the potential role of CTPS manipulation in the treatment of HFD-induced obesity.'
 'Nodal is a signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in the development of the body plan during early embryogenesis. In the classical model, Nodal signals through a receptor complex comprising Type I and Type II single-transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (Acvr) and the co-receptor Tdgf1. However, it is currently unclear whether receptor binding can also affect the distribution of Nodals themselves through the embryo, and which of the putative Acvr paralogs mediate Nodal signaling in zebrafish. Here, the authors characterize three Type I (Acvr1) and four Type II (Acvr2) homologs and show that – except for Acvr1c – all receptor-encoding transcripts are maternally deposited and present during zebrafish embryogenesis. The authors generated mutants and used them together with combinatorial morpholino knockdown and CRISPR F0 knockout (KO) approaches to assess compound loss-of-function phenotypes. They discovered that the Acvr2 homologs function partly redundantly and partly independently of Nodal to pattern the early zebrafish embryo, whereas the Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b redundantly act as major mediators of Nodal signaling. By combining quantitative analyses with expression manipulations, the authors found that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.'
 'Type I interferon ( IFN-I )-mediated antiviral responses are crucial for host defense against viral infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of IFN-I production are not fully understood. In this study, the authors used a murine fibroblast reporter model to investigate the influence of various stochastic and deterministic host-intrinsic factors on early IFN-I responses. They found that epigenetic drugs influenced the percentage of responding cells, and that transient heritability drove responder fates, which was verified with mathematical modeling. The authors also found that cell density played an important role in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing. Together, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying early IFN-I responses and may lead to improved IFN-mediated immune therapies.'
 'Microtubules (MTs) are built from α-/β-tubulin dimers and used as tracks by kinesin and dynein motors to transport a variety of cargos such as mRNAs, proteins, and organelles within the cell. Tubulins are subjected to several post-translational modifications (PTMs) including glutamylation, which adds one or more glutamic acid residues as branched peptide chains to the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin. In this study, the authors found that in Drosophila ovaries, glutamylation of α-tubulin isotypes occurred clearly on the C-terminal ends of αTub84B and αTub84D (αTub84B/D) but not on αTub67C. The C-terminal ends of αTub84B/D are glutamylated at several glutamyl sidechains in various combinations. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian αTub84B/D and with this for the proper localization of glutamylated microtubules. The normal distribution of kinesin-1 in the germline relies on TTLL5. Next, two kinesin-1-dependent processes, the precise localization of Staufen and the fast, bidirectional ooplasmic streaming, depend on TTLL5, too, suggesting a causative pathway. In the nervous system, a mutation of TTLL5 that inactivates its enzymatic activity decreases the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria. The authors' results demonstrate in vivo roles of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of α-tubulins and point to the in vivo importance of α-tubulin glutamylation for cellular functions involving microtubule transport.'
 'GENESPACE' is a new tool that helps scientists understand how genes have evolved over time. It does this by looking at the physical location of genes on chromosomes and comparing them across different species. This helps researchers understand how genes have changed and how they are related to each other. The tool is particularly useful for studying complex genomes that have undergone many changes over time, such as those found in plants and animals. By using GENESPACE, scientists can better understand how genes have evolved and how they are related to each other, which can help them make predictions about how organisms will respond to changes in their environment. The tool is available for anyone to use online.
 ' Bacteria often exist in communities with other species, and their interactions can have important effects on their behavior and survival. One such community is made up of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which are often found together in the human body. When grown together, P. aeruginosa can reduce the growth of S. aureus. However, when grown alone, S. aureus can outcompete P. aeruginosa. This study used mathematical modeling and experiments to show that changes in the growth environment can determine the final population composition of these two species. The study found that changes in the carbon source in the growth medium affect the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric called absolute growth. As a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture. This is due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. The study also found that the relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. These results demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature, provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations. '
 'The amount of scientific data being published is growing rapidly, but there are few methods for capturing knowledge about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions between diverse groups of species. To improve access to this knowledge, a framework for curation of the scientific literature studying interspecies interactions has been developed. The framework provides a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen–host interaction data at the level of the host, pathogen, strain, gene, and genotype. The concept of a multispecies genotype, the ‘metagenotype,’ is introduced to facilitate capturing changes in the disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility observed by gene alterations. The framework has been used to develop PHI-Canto, a community curation tool for use by publication authors. The tool supports the classification of genes as ‘pathogen’ or ‘host,’ and enables the variations of the same gene in different strains to be captured. It also formulates the concept of a ‘metagenotype’ to represent the interaction between specific strains of both a pathogen and a host within a multispecies genotype. The framework also includes supporting ontologies and controlled vocabularies, including the generic Pathogen–Host Interaction Phenotype Ontology (PHIPO), to annotate phenotypes connected to genotypes at the level of a single species (pathogen or host) and multiple species (pathogen–host interaction phenotypes). The overall curation framework described herein, the concept of annotating metagenotypes, and ongoing generic ontology development is a suitable approach for adoption and use by a wide range of research communities in the life sciences focused on different types of interspecies interactions occurring within or across kingdoms in different environments and at multiple (micro to macro) scales.'
 'Sequence variation in enhancers that control cell-type-specific gene transcription contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations . However, it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers in their native genomic context . Using F1-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice, we identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. We find that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. We observe that the AP-1 family of TFs (Fos/Jun) are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function, including sequences flanking core TF motifs and AP-1 half sites. Taken together, these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.'
 'Viruses interact with the intracellular transport machinery to promote viral replication. Such host–virus interactions can drive host gene adaptation, leaving signatures of pathogen-driven evolution in host genomes. Here, we leverage these genetic signatures to identify the dynein activating adaptor, ninein-like (NINL), as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and as a target of viral antagonism. Unique among genes encoding components of active dynein complexes, NINL has evolved under recurrent positive (diversifying) selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region. Consistent with a role for NINL in host immunity, we demonstrate that NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in increased permissiveness to viral replication. Moreover, we show that proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. Our work reveals the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of host–virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.'
 'Actin is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of eukaryotic cells. Actin isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner and have distinct biochemical properties and functions. In this study, the authors report the high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle α-actin, cardiac muscle α-actin, β-actin, and γ-actin in the Mg2+·ADP state with their native post-translational modifications. The structures revealed isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus that shift closer to the filament surface upon myosin binding, thereby establishing isoform-specific interfaces. The authors' findings provide a comprehensive understanding of in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms and complement the repertoire of known actin structures.'
 'Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences' (TARDIS) is a new approach to large-scale transgenesis in multicellular organisms. TARDIS splits the transgenesis process into two steps: creation of individuals carrying experimentally introduced sequence libraries, followed by inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components into engineered genomic sites. This approach increases transgenic throughput up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods. TARDIS has been demonstrated in Caenorhabditis elegans, where it has been used to generate unique animal barcodes and transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries. The system is adaptable to any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated. TARDIS has the potential to expand the impact of exploratory transgenesis in functional domains that are difficult to replicate in single-cell models.
 'The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in an asymmetric bilayer with embedded lipoproteins and transmembrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs). These proteins play vital functional roles, such as exchanging small molecules with the environment through their transmembrane β-barrel porins. The translocation and folding of OMPs involve many proteins, including essential and auxiliary ones that form multiple complexes in cooperation. In this study, the authors used a deep learning pipeline called AF2Complex to identify protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and applied it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, the authors found not only expected interactions but also unexpected ones with profound implications. They then predicted atomic structures for these protein complexes, which explained experimental observations and led to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent, precursor OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to a β-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways by using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.'
 'Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are important for regulating movement and motivation. These neurons release DA and other neurotransmitters from their axons in the striatum, a region of the brain involved in movement. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the release of these neurotransmitters are not well understood. In this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that neurexins, a family of proteins that regulate synaptic connections, play a role in regulating the release of DA from midbrain neurons. They found that mice with a deletion of neurexins in DA neurons had impaired amphetamine-induced locomotion, decreased DA reuptake, and increased GABA release from DA neurons in the ventral striatum. These findings suggest that neurexins play a role in regulating the release of DA and other neurotransmitters from midbrain neurons.'
 'The use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions is being investigated throughout Africa to improve healthcare access. However, the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones and the inequities in ownership have not been quantified. This study estimates the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 African countries, identifies a relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic, and quantifies inequities in ownership. The study found that 82% of individuals in 33 countries own mobile phones, with 42% owning basic mobile phones and 40% owning smartphones. Individuals who live close to a health clinic have higher odds of ownership than those who do not. Men, urban residents, and those aged 26–40 have higher odds of owning a smartphone than a basic mobile phone. The study highlights the need to address inequities in mobile phone ownership to ensure that mHealth interventions are accessible to all.'
 'SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels can be used to assess humoral immune responses following infection or vaccination, and may predict risk of future infection. Higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike antibodies are known to be associated with increased protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, variation in antibody levels and risk factors for lower antibody levels following each round of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have not been explored across a wide range of socio-demographic, SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, and health factors within population-based cohorts. Samples were collected from 9361 individuals from TwinsUK and ALSPAC UK population-based longitudinal studies and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Cross-sectional sampling was undertaken jointly in April-May 2021 (TwinsUK, N=4256; ALSPAC, N=4622) and in TwinsUK only in November 2021-January 2022 (N=3575). Variation in antibody levels after first, second, and third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with health, socio-demographic, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination variables were analysed. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we tested associations between antibody levels following vaccination and: (1) SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination (s); (2) health, socio-demographic, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination variables. Within TwinsUK, single-vaccinated individuals with the lowest 20% of anti-Spike antibody levels at initial testing had threefold greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next 6–9 months (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 6.0) compared to the top 20%. In TwinsUK and ALSPAC, individuals identified as at increased risk of COVID-19 complication through the UK ‘Shielded Patient List’ had consistently greater odds (two- to fourfold) of having antibody levels in the lowest 10%. Third vaccination increased absolute antibody levels for almost all individuals, and reduced relative disparities compared with earlier vaccinations. These findings quantify the association between antibody level and risk of subsequent infection, and support a policy of triple vaccination for the generation of protective antibodies.'
