The study presents a computational model for the structure of the O-antigen acetyltransferase OafB from Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The model is based on evolutionary co-variance analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. The study shows that the transmembrane region of OafB is stable under physiological conditions and that the AT3 domain and SGNH domain are likely to interact. The study also integrates the model with existing x-ray structure data and published mutational data to allow additional structure-function analysis. The study utilizes both classical molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations to generate a refined functional model for this important family of membrane proteins.
 'Honey bees must make quick and accurate decisions about which flowers to visit for nectar and pollen . To understand how they make these decisions, researchers used a controlled flight arena that varied the likelihood of a stimulus offering reward or punishment and the quality of evidence for stimuli. They found that honey bee decision-making was sophisticated and sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence. Acceptance responses had higher accuracy than rejection responses and were more sensitive to changes in available evidence and reward likelihood. Fast acceptances were more likely to be correct than slower acceptances, a phenomenon also seen in primates and indicative of a dynamic evidence threshold for a decision. To investigate the minimally sufficient circuitry required for these decision-making capacities, the researchers developed a novel model of decision-making that could be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain and was neurobiologically plausible. Their model proposes a system for robust autonomous decision-making with potential application in robotics.'
 'Metformin is a widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes that has been shown to extend lifespan in various organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this effect are not well understood. In this study, researchers used the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the role of ether lipids in metformin-induced lifespan extension. They found that metformin stimulates the production of ether lipids, which are important for the drug's pro-longevity effects. The researchers also found that the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery is necessary for lifespan extension induced by other drugs and genetic interventions. They suggest that ether lipids may play a role in promoting healthy aging by activating metabolic stress defenses. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms behind metformin's lifespan-extending effects and suggests that ether lipids may be a promising therapeutic target for healthy aging.'
 'Gut microbes play important roles in human health, but we don't know how they interact with each other. Researchers used data from 56 baboons to study how gut microbes interact with each other. They found that most microbial relationships are weak and negative, and that many of the same relationships are found in all the baboons. This suggests that gut microbes may have similar ecological roles in all baboons. The researchers also found that some microbial relationships are stronger and more consistent in baboons than in humans. This could help us understand how gut microbes interact with each other and how they affect human health.'
 'Researchers have found that gamma oscillations, which are thought to underlie cognitive processes, are driven by respiration in the piriform cortex of awake mice. These oscillations are generated by a feedback loop between local excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb. The researchers also found that respiration-driven gamma oscillations determine odor-assembly representations through a winner-take-all computation taking place within breathing cycles. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex and their role in olfaction.'
 'Replication of DNA in cells happens in a coordinated way, with certain regions of the genome replicating later than others. This is important for the proper functioning of the genome. In some cases, certain regions of the genome do not replicate at all, which can lead to problems. Scientists have been trying to understand how this happens, and they have found that a protein called SUUR is important for this process. SUUR is a type of helicase that helps to slow down the replication of DNA. The scientists used a new method to find out more about SUUR and its interactions with other proteins. They found that SUUR works with another protein called Mod ( Mdg4 ) -67 . 2 to control when certain regions of the genome replicate. This helps to make sure that the genome is functioning properly.'
 'Biological age' is a concept that describes how well a person's body is functioning relative to their chronological age. It is often used to predict health outcomes and disease risk. However, the concept of biological age in children is not well understood. In this study, researchers used four different biological age markers to assess the relationship between biological age and child development. These markers included telomere length, DNA methylation age, and two novel candidate biological age markers based on gene expression and proteins and metabolites. The study included over 1,000 children from five to 12 years old from six European countries. The researchers found that all four biological age markers were weakly correlated with each other. They also found that higher birthweight was associated with greater immunometabolic age, smoke exposure with greater DNA methylation age, and high family affluence with longer telomere length. Among associations with child developmental measures, all markers except telomere length were associated with greater height, at least at nominal significance (p<0.05). Immunometabolic age was associated with better working memory and reduced inattentiveness, while DNA methylation age was associated with greater inattentiveness and poorer externalizing behaviors. Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors. In children, as in adults, biological aging appears to be a multi-faceted process and adiposity is an important correlate of accelerated biological aging. Patterns of associations suggested that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging, apparent even in children.'
 'Asthma is a complex disorder with multiple clinical phenotypes, and its heritability is estimated to be around 60-70%. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been used to identify genetic associates of asthma, but most studies used a broad definition of ‘doctor-diagnosed asthma’, which diluted genetic signals by not considering asthma heterogeneity. In this study, the authors conducted a novel multivariate GWAS meta-analysis of wheezing phenotypes jointly derived using unbiased analysis of data collected from birth to 18 years in 9568 individuals from five UK birth cohorts. They identified 44 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with early-onset persistent, 25 with pre-school remitting, 33 with mid-childhood remitting, and 32 with late-onset wheeze. They identified a novel locus on chr9q21.13 associated exclusively with early-onset persistent wheeze. They used Promoter Capture Hi-C loops to identify rs75260654 as the most likely causative SNP and showed that the risk allele (T) confers a reduction in ANXA1 expression. Finally, in a murine model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway disease, they demonstrated that anxa1 protein expression increased and anxa1 mRNA was significantly induced in lung tissue following HDM exposure. Using anxa1-/- deficient mice, they showed that loss of anxa1 results in heightened airway hyperreactivity and Th2 inflammation upon allergen challenge. The authors suggest that targeting this pathway in persistent disease may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect. The study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of wheezing phenotypes and highlights the importance of considering asthma heterogeneity in genetic studies.
 'Intercropping' is a method of farming where two or more crops are grown together in the same field. This method has been shown to increase crop yields and improve soil health. However, the optimal way to choose which crops to grow together is not well understood. In this study, the authors investigated how the history of growing different crops together affects their interactions and yields. They found that when crops have a common history of growing together, they tend to have less competition and more facilitation, leading to increased yields. This effect was more pronounced in lower-fertility soils, where competition is more likely to limit crop yields. The authors suggest that this finding could be used to inform the design of intercropping systems that maximize yields and improve soil health.'
 'Transparent games' are a new type of game-theoretical task that allows researchers to study dynamic interactions during decision-making. In these games, two agents engage in a game on a shared transparent touchscreen display, allowing them to observe each other's actions in real-time. In a study of human and macaque pairs playing a transparent version of the coordination game 'Bach-or-Stravinsky', researchers found that humans developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize the payoffs. In contrast, macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination. Remarkably, two animals learned to coordinate dynamically after training with a human confederate. This pair selected the faster agent's preferred option, exhibiting turn-taking behavior that was captured by modeling the visibility of the partner's action before one's own movement. These results suggest that dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans but can occur on the background of different social attitudes and cognitive capacities in rhesus monkeys. The study highlights the importance of action visibility in promoting the emergence and maintenance of coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions.
 'Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells, including granulosa cells. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells ( hPGCLCs ) from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors ( TFs ) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, our cells form ovary-like organoids ( ovaroids ) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.'
 'The skin color of humans varies widely across different populations, and the genetic basis for this variation is still not fully understood. In this study, the authors analyzed the genetic ancestry and skin color of individuals from the Kalinago Territory of Dominica, a population with high African and Native American ancestry. They found that Native American ancestry alone caused a significant reduction in skin color, while African ancestry had no effect. The authors also identified a new albinism allele in the Kalinago population, which was responsible for the albinism phenotype observed in three individuals. The allele was found to be of European origin, and its effect on skin color was much larger than that of previously identified Native American alleles. The study provides new insights into the genetic basis of skin color variation in populations with mixed ancestry.'
 'Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Exercise and antioxidants are two common treatments for diabetes. However, the exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains largely unclear. In this study, the authors compared the effects of exercise and antioxidants on type 2 diabetic rats. They found that moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver. In contrast, antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both of these two interventions could promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMPK signaling; therefore, ameliorating diabetes. During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation. However, excessive exercise increased oxidative damage and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK. Overall, the authors' results illustrate that both exercise and antioxidants improve blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox state. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.'
 'The escape trajectory (ET) of prey is a crucial factor in avoiding predation. Previous geometric models predicted a single ET, but many species show highly variable ETs with multiple preferred directions. The reasons why animals prefer specific multiple ETs are unclear. In this study, the authors constructed a novel geometric model that incorporates the time required for prey to turn and the predator’s position at the end of its attack. The optimal ET was determined by maximizing the time difference of arrival at the edge of the safety zone between the prey and predator. By fitting the model to the experimental data of fish Pagrus major, the authors show that the model can clearly explain the observed multiple preferred ETs. By changing the parameters of the same model within a realistic range, the authors were able to produce various patterns of ETs empirically observed in other species (e.g., insects and frogs). Their results open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.'
 'Prime editing (PE) is a new genome editing technology that can directly repair a nicked DNA strand without creating a double-strand break. This makes it more precise and efficient than other genome editing methods. In this study, the authors compared PE to other genome editing methods in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). They found that PE was overall more efficient and precise than other methods, especially for introducing heterozygous mutations. They also found that delivering the PE components as mRNA improved editing efficiency up to 13-fold compared to delivering them as plasmids or RNPs. Finally, they demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach could be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60%. These findings suggest that PE has the potential to become the preferred method for genome editing of hPSCs.'
 'Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell. The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is used to classify MM patients into three stages based on the amount of bone marrow damage and the presence of certain genetic markers. In this study, the authors used single-cell transcriptome sequencing to compare the gene expression patterns of plasma cells and immune cells in patients with different R-ISS stages. They found that a novel type of plasma cell, which was positive for a protein called NKG7, was more abundant in patients with stage II MM. They also found that a type of plasma cell that expressed high levels of the proteins MKI67 and PCNA was associated with poor prognosis and EBV infection. The authors also identified a protein called RRM2, which promoted the growth of MM cells. They found that the proportions of certain types of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and NKT cells, decreased as the R-ISS stage increased. The authors also found that the interactions between certain types of immune cells and myeloid cells were associated with potential immunotargets for MM treatment. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying MM progression and identifies potential therapeutic targets.'
 'The CRISPR-Cas system is a powerful tool for genome editing and gene regulation. It consists of a Cas protein and a guide RNA that can be programmed to target specific DNA sequences. The Cas protein can then cut the DNA at the target site, allowing for the insertion or deletion of genetic material. Researchers have discovered a new type of Cas protein, Cas7-11, which has unique properties that make it a promising candidate for gene editing and regulation. To understand how Cas7-11 works, researchers have determined its structure using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals that Cas7-11 has a unique backbone that resembles a combination of Cas7 and Cas11 subunits. This backbone contains four Cas7-like domains and one Cas11-like domain. The structure also shows how Cas7-11 processes and recognizes the CRISPR RNA, and how it cleaves the target RNA in a metal-dependent manner. The structure provides valuable insights into the molecular basis of Cas7-11 function and opens up new possibilities for its use in gene editing and regulation.'
 'Addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity. While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity, our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited. Here, we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity on tree productivity, and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity, and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested. Given the complexity of interactions between species and genetic diversity, tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity, we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation.'
 'Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but it remains challenging to track single molecules while simultaneously detecting their interactions. In this study, the authors describe a novel property of rhodamine dyes called proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), in which one fluorophore can reactivate a second fluorophore from a dark state. PAPA requires proximity between the two fluorophores, yet it operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The authors show that PAPA can be used in live cells to detect protein–protein interactions and highlight a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. In proof-of-concept experiments, PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. These results establish a new way in which a photophysical property of fluorophores can be harnessed to study molecular interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells.'
 'Calcium supplementation has been shown to improve bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in older adults, but its effects on young people are controversial. To comprehensively summarize the evidence for the effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in young populations (≤35 years old), this systematic review and meta-analysis identified 43 studies involving 7,382 subjects. Moderate certainty of evidence showed that calcium supplementation was associated with the accretion of BMD and BMC, especially on femoral neck (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.627, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.338–0.915; SMD 0.364, 95% CI 0.134–0.595; respectively) and total body (SMD 0.330, 95% CI 0.163–0.496; SMD 0.149, 95% CI 0.006–0.291) , also with a slight improvement effect on lumbar spine BMC (SMD 0.163, 95% CI 0.008–0.317) , no effects on total hip BMD and BMC and lumbar spine BMD were observed. Subgroup analyses suggested that the improvement of bone at femoral neck was more pronounced in the peripeak bone mass (PBM) population (20–35 years) than the pre-PBM population (<20 years). Our findings provided novel insights and evidence in calcium supplementation, which showed that calcium supplementation significantly improves bone mass, implying that preventive calcium supplementation before or around achieving PBM may be a shift in the window of intervention for osteoporosis.

Influenza A virus (IAV) forms liquid cytosolic condensates, known as viral inclusions, during its replication program. These condensates are composed of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) and are thought to be sites dedicated to IAV genome assembly. In this study, the authors used influenza A virus liquid cytosolic condensates, AKA viral inclusions, to provide a proof of concept that liquid condensate hardening via changes in the valency of its components is more efficient than altering their concentration or the temperature of the cell. Liquid IAV inclusions may be hardened by targeting vRNP interactions via the known NP (nucleoprotein) oligomerising molecule, nucleozin, both in vitro and in vivo without affecting host proteome abundance or solubility. This study is a starting point for understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions and may offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies.
 'Kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors that move along microtubules to transport various cargos . Kinesin-4 is a unique motor that inhibits microtubule dynamics . The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin dimers revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin, which is in between the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends. KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics. This study provides a structural model of microtubule dynamics inhibition by the kinesin-4 motor domain, which is essential for proper length control of axons.'
 'Highly potent stem cells either self-renew or launch complex differentiation programs, using mechanisms that are only partly understood. Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) perpetuate without change over evolutionary time and generate cystoblast daughters that develop into nurse cells and oocytes. Cystoblasts initiate differentiation by generating a transient syncytial state, the germline cyst, and by increasing pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification, actions likely to suppress transposable element activity. Relatively open GSC chromatin is further restricted by Polycomb repression of testis or somatic cell-expressed genes briefly active in early female germ cells. Subsequently, Neijre/CBP and Myc help upregulate growth and reprogram GSC metabolism by altering mitochondrial transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis, and other processes. In all these respects, GSC differentiation resembles development of the totipotent zygote. We propose that the totipotent stem cell state was shaped by the need to resist transposon activity over evolutionary timescales.'
 'Biological rhythms are ubiquitous and play a crucial role in many aspects of life. These rhythms can be generated by internal clocks, such as the circadian clock, which produces daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In plants, the circadian clock controls the timing of anthesis, or the opening of flowers, in domesticated sunflowers. In these plants, thousands of florets are tightly packed onto a capitulum disk and develop in a spiral pattern. However, during anthesis, florets undergo simultaneous maturation in discrete ring-like pseudowhorls. The authors show that the circadian clock controls the timing of floral organ growth and that the effects of light on this process are time-of-day dependent. Disruption of circadian rhythms in floral organ development causes loss of pseudowhorl formation and large reductions in pollinator visits. The authors propose that the circadian clock acts in concert with environmental response pathways to tightly synchronize the anthesis of hundreds of florets each day, generating spatial patterns on the developing capitulum disk. This coordinated mass release of floral rewards at predictable times of day likely promotes pollinator visits and plant reproductive success.'
 'Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive chemical that can damage the macromolecules required for life. Organisms have evolved defense mechanisms to protect themselves from hydrogen peroxide, but these defenses are temperature dependent. In this study, researchers found that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans uses temperature information perceived by sensory neurons to cope with the temperature-dependent threat of hydrogen peroxide produced by the pathogenic bacterium Enterococcus faecium. These nematodes preemptively induce the expression of specific hydrogen peroxide defenses in response to perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons. These neurons communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical.'
 'Class switch recombination (CSR) is a process that allows antibodies to change their class (type) in response to different pathogens. This process is important for the body to make effective antibodies. However, the process of CSR can sometimes go wrong and lead to genetic mutations. In this study, researchers found that two proteins called senataxin and RNase H2 are important for removing a type of genetic structure called R loops that can form during CSR. When these proteins are not working properly, more R loops form and this can lead to genetic mutations. The researchers used mice to study this process and found that mice that lack both senataxin and RNase H2 have more R loops and genetic mutations than mice that lack only one of these proteins. The researchers also found that the process of CSR itself is not affected by the lack of these proteins. This study provides important information about how the body can make effective antibodies while also preventing genetic mutations.'
 'The COVID-19 pandemic has been caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has mutated into several variants, including Omicron. These variants are more transmissible and resistant to neutralizing antibodies, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines. A new vaccine candidate, mos-tri-RBD, has been developed that carries key mutations from Omicron and other variants. The vaccine was tested in rats and found to elicit potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against Omicron and other variants. The mos-tri-RBD vaccine was also tested as a booster shot and found to be more effective than homo-tri-RBD or BBIBP-CorV. These results suggest that mos-tri-RBD could be a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate for combating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron. '
 'Malaria is a deadly disease caused by parasites that infect red blood cells and digest hemoglobin for energy. The enzyme PfA-M17 is involved in the final step of hemoglobin digestion, breaking down peptides into amino acids. A new study has shown that PfA-M17 is essential for the survival of the parasite, and that its inhibition leads to multiple digestive vacuoles and the accumulation of peptides. This suggests that PfA-M17 plays a role in the final stages of hemoglobin digestion and could be a potential target for new malaria treatments. The study used a combination of reverse genetics and a compound specifically designed to inhibit PfA-M17 to show its importance in the survival of the parasite. The findings of this study could lead to the development of new drugs to treat malaria.'
 'Early hematopoiesis is a continuous process in which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) gradually differentiate toward specific lineages . Aging and myeloid malignant transformation are characterized by changes in the composition and regulation of HSPCs . In this study , the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to characterize an enriched population of human HSPCs obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals . Based on their transcriptional profile , the authors identified changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging , and differences in their functionality , as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis . Trajectory inference revealed that altered gene expression dynamics accompanied cell differentiation , which could explain aging-associated changes in hematopoiesis . Next , the authors focused on key regulators of transcription by constructing gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) and detected regulons that were specifically active in elderly individuals . Using previous findings in healthy cells as a reference , the authors analyzed scRNA-seq data obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) and detected specific alterations of the expression dynamics of genes involved in erythroid differentiation in all patients with MDS such as TRIB2 . In addition , the comparison between transcriptional programs and GRNs regulating normal HSPCs and MDS HSPCs allowed the identification of regulons that were specifically active in MDS cases such as SMAD1 , HOXA6 , POU2F2 , and RUNX1 suggesting a role of these transcription factors ( TFs ) in the pathogenesis of the disease . In summary , the authors demonstrate that the combination of single-cell technologies with computational analysis tools enable the study of a variety of cellular mechanisms involved in complex biological systems such as early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with perturbations such as aging and malignant transformation . Furthermore , the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients .'
 'Latent inhibition' is a type of learning in which an animal does not respond to a stimulus even when it is associated with a reward. This type of learning is important for animals to ignore irrelevant stimuli and focus on more important ones. Honey bees show latent inhibition towards an odor they have experienced without association with food reinforcement. Individual honey bees from the same colony differ in the degree to which they show latent inhibition, and these individual differences have a genetic basis. To investigate the mechanisms that underlie individual differences in latent inhibition, two honey bee lines for high and low latent inhibition were selected. These lines were crossed, and a Quantitative Trait Locus for latent inhibition was mapped to a region of the genome that contains the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Disruption of Amtyr1 signaling either pharmacologically or through RNAi qualitatively changed the expression of latent inhibition but had little or slight effects on appetitive conditioning. These results suggest that Amtyr1 modulates inhibitory processing in the central nervous system. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain during pharmacological blockade are consistent with a model that Amtyr1 indirectly regulates at inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system. The authors propose a neural model that suggests a mechanism for the broad pleiotropy this gene has on several different behaviors. The findings are important for understanding how honey bees learn to ignore irrelevant stimuli and focus on more important ones, as well as how individual differences in this type of learning can be inherited and affect colony behavior.'
 'The airway epithelium is composed of many different cell types that play important roles in maintaining the health of the airways. However, studying these cells can be difficult because they are often hidden from view. To overcome this problem, researchers have developed a new technique that uses the natural fluorescence of molecules called NADH, NADPH, and FAD to identify and track different cell types in real time. This technique allows researchers to see how the cells behave and interact with each other in their natural environment, which can help them better understand how the airways work and how diseases affect them. The researchers used this technique to study the airways of mice and found that they could distinguish between different cell types based on their unique fluorescence signatures. They also found that some cell types formed structures called secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs) that allowed them to sample and process antigens from their environment. This finding could help researchers better understand how the airways protect against infections and how diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect this process. Overall, this new technique could be a powerful tool for studying the airways and could help researchers better understand how to treat diseases that affect them.'
 'Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of adult heart to regenerate after injury . N6-methyladenosine ( m6A ) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 ( Mettl3 ) plays an important role in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses . However , the role of m6A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear . To study m6A function in heart regeneration , the authors modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo . Knockdown of Mettl3 significantly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice . However , Mettl3 overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice . Conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing ( MeRIP-seq ) and RNA-seq identified Fgf16 as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification during postnatal heart regeneration . RIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Mettl3 negatively regulates Fgf16 mRNA expression in an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent manner . The silencing of Fgf16 suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes . However , the overexpression of ΔFgf16 , in which the m6A consensus sequence was mutated , significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16 . The authors' data demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces Fgf16 mRNA levels through an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent pathway , thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration .

 'The risk of developing a second primary cancer (SPC) after the first primary cancer (FPC) is increasing. The underlying causal relationship remains unclear. We conducted a pan-cancer association study in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the UK Biobank cohort. We found 11 significant cross-correlations among different cancers after harmonizing the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) results. Whereas only 4 of them were confirmed by MR to have a robust causal relationship. In particular, patients initially diagnosed with oral pharyngeal cancer would have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Meanwhile, ovary cancer was identified to be a risk factor for soft tissue cancer. And kidney cancer was likely to cause the development of lung cancer and myeloma. A certain type of primary cancer may cause another second primary cancer, and the profound mechanisms need to be studied in the future.

 'In economic decision-making, individuals choose between items based on their perceived value. For both humans and nonhuman primates, these decisions are often carried out while shifting gaze between the available options. Recent studies in humans suggest that these shifts in gaze actively influence choice, manifesting as a bias in favor of the items that are viewed first, viewed last, or viewed for the overall longest duration in a given trial. To identify the mechanism that links gaze behavior to the neural computations underlying value-based choices, a suitable animal model of this behavior is needed. In this study, the authors developed a novel value-based choice task for macaque monkeys that captures the essential features of the human paradigms in which gaze biases have been observed. Using this task, the authors identified gaze biases in the monkeys that were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in humans. In addition, the monkeys’ gaze biases were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework previously used to describe gaze biases in humans—the first time this framework has been used to assess value-based decision mechanisms in nonhuman primates. Together, these findings suggest a common mechanism that can explain gaze-related choice biases across species, and open the way for mechanistic studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.'
 'Most phytophagous insect species exhibit a limited diet breadth and specialize on a few or a single host plant. In contrast, some species display a remarkably large diet breadth, with host plants spanning several families and many species. It is unclear, however, whether this phylogenetic generalism is supported by a generic metabolic use of common host chemical compounds (‘metabolic generalism’) or alternatively by distinct uses of diet-specific compounds (‘multi-host metabolic specialism’). Here, we simultaneously investigated the metabolomes of fruit diets and of individuals of a generalist phytophagous species, Drosophila suzukii, that developed on them. The direct comparison of metabolomes of diets and consumers enabled us to disentangle the metabolic fate of common and rarer dietary compounds. We showed that the consumption of biochemically dissimilar diets resulted in a canalized, generic response from generalist individuals, consistent with the metabolic generalism hypothesis. We also showed that many diet-specific metabolites, such as those related to the particular color, odor, or taste of diets, were not metabolized, and rather accumulated in consumer individuals, even when probably detrimental to fitness. As a result, while individuals were mostly similar across diets, the detection of their particular diet was straightforward. Our study thus supports the view that dietary generalism may emerge from a passive, opportunistic use of various resources, contrary to more widespread views of an active role of adaptation in this process. Such a passive stance towards dietary chemicals, probably costly in the short term, might favor the later evolution of new diet specializations.'
 'Yersinia pestis is a bacterium that causes the bubonic plague. It evolved from a less virulent ancestor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, through a series of genetic changes. One of these changes was the acquisition of the ymt gene, which allowed Y. pestis to survive and colonize the flea midgut. Another change was the loss of three genes, rcsA, pde2, and pde3, which altered the c-di-GMP signalling pathway and increased biofilm-forming capability. The Rcs phosphorelay system, a non-orthodox two-component signal transduction system, is involved in this process. In Y. pestis, the rcsD gene is a putative pseudogene due to a 1 bp deletion, but it retains a limited ability to modulate biofilm formation. The authors found that the frameshift mutation in rcsDpe produces a 103-amino acid protein containing the C-terminal HPt domain of RcsD, designated as RcsD-Hpt. This protein plays a dominant role in Rcs signalling in Y. pestis. Frameshifted rcsD alters Rcs signal transduction, subsequently modulating the expression of dozens of genes and the capacity for biofilm formation in Y. pestis. These evolutionary events may represent an important step in the emergence of ubiquitous branches of Y. pestis that can capably maintain plague outbreaks.'
 'The peer review process is a crucial step in the publication of scientific research, where manuscripts are evaluated by independent experts in the field before being accepted for publication. However, concerns have been raised regarding subjectivity in this process that may affect the fairness and accuracy of evaluations. This study used OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT to analyze language use in over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022–2023. The results demonstrated high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The study also revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. Additionally, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author. The study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts and underscores the importance of transparent peer review in studying equitability in scientific publishing. The findings suggest that ChatGPT can identify areas of concern in scientific peer review, such as gender bias, and provide insights into how to improve the fairness and accuracy of evaluations.'
 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer that can spread to the liver, causing a poor prognosis. Researchers have found that continuous infusion of interferon-alpha (IFNα) can reduce the risk of liver CRC colonization by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). IFNα promotes the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) defenestration, extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition, thus strengthening the liver vascular barrier and impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration. IFNα also endowed LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential, supporting the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and ultimately leading to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.'
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major public health concern in humans and animals. In the United States, IAV infections cause significant economic losses to the swine industry. To prevent IAV infections, pigs are vaccinated with a variety of vaccines. However, the effectiveness of these vaccines is limited due to the continuous evolution of IAV. In this study, the authors directly sequenced bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains. They identified 54 reassortant viruses that were grouped in 17 single and 16 mixed genotypes. Notably, they found that prime-boost vaccinated pigs had less reassortant viruses than nonvaccinated pigs, likely due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses. However, direct sequencing from BALF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. Overall, the authors highlight the value of IAV vaccination not only at limiting virus replication in pigs but also at protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential.'
 'The hippocampus is a part of the brain that helps us remember things. It contains cells called place cells that fire when we are in a specific location. When we encounter something new in a location, the place cells in that location change the way they fire. This is called remapping. Scientists have found that place cells remap when we encounter something new in a location, but it is not clear whether this remapping is important for remembering things. To study this, scientists used a special camera to watch the activity of place cells in the hippocampus of rats as they learned to avoid a shock in a certain location. They found that place cells remapped more when the rats remembered the shock than when they forgot it. This suggests that remapping may be important for remembering things. This is important because it helps us understand how the brain stores memories.'
 'HIV-1 infection results in the activation of inflammasome that may facilitate viral spread and establishment of viral reservoirs . We evaluated the effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells . Expression of caspase-1 , NLRP3 , and IL-1β was increased in lymph nodes and bone marrow between day 1 and 3 after HIV-1 infection ( mean fold change ( FC ) of 2 . 08 , 3 . 23 , and 6 . 05 , p<0 . 001 , respectively ) . IFI16 and AIM2 expression peaked at day 24 and coincides with increased IL-18 levels ( 6 . 89 vs 83 . 19 pg/ml , p=0 . 004 ) , increased viral load and CD4+ T cells loss in blood ( p<0 . 005 and p<0 . 0001 , for the spleen respectively ) . Treatment with VX-765 significantly reduced TNF-α at day 11 ( 0 . 47 vs 2 . 2 pg/ml , p=0 . 045 ) , IL-18 at day 22 ( 7 . 8 vs 23 . 2 pg/ml , p=0 . 04 ) , CD4+ T cells ( 44 . 3% vs 36 , 7% , p=0 . 01 ) , viral load ( 4 . 26 vs 4 . 89 log 10 copies/ml , p=0 . 027 ) , and total HIV-1 DNA in the spleen ( 1 054 vs 2 889 copies /106 cells , p=0 . 029 ) . We demonstrated that targeting inflammasome activation early after infection may represent a therapeutic strategy towards HIV cure to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion and reduce immune activation , viral load , and the HIV-1 reservoir formation .'
 'The loss of a spouse is often cited as the most traumatic event in a person’s life . However, for most people, the severity of grief and its maladaptive effects subside over time via an understudied adaptive process. Like humans, socially monogamous prairie voles ( Microtus ochrogaster ) form opposite-sex pair bonds, and upon partner separation, show stress phenotypes that diminish over time. We test the hypothesis that extended partner separation diminishes pair bond-associated behaviors and causes pair bond transcriptional signatures to erode. We found that these behaviors persist despite prolonged separation in both same-sex and opposite-sex paired voles. Opposite-sex pair bonding led to changes in accumbal transcription that were stably maintained while animals remained paired but eroded following prolonged partner separation. Eroded genes are associated with gliogenesis and myelination, suggesting a previously undescribed role for glia in pair bonding and loss. Further, we pioneered neuron-specific translating ribosomal affinity purification in voles. Neuronally enriched transcriptional changes revealed dopaminergic-, mitochondrial-, and steroid hormone signaling-associated gene clusters sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation. Our results suggest that partner separation erodes transcriptomic signatures of pair bonding despite core behavioral features of the bond remaining intact, revealing potential molecular processes priming a vole to be able to form a new bond.'
 'Motor variability is a fundamental feature of developing systems that allows motor exploration and learning. In human infants, leg movements involve a small number of basic coordination patterns called locomotor primitives. However, whether and when motor variability could emerge from these primitives remains unknown. Here, we longitudinally followed 18 infants on 2–3 time points between birth and walking onset and recorded the activity of their leg muscles during locomotor or rhythmic movements. Using unsupervised machine learning, we show that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development. In the neonatal period, infants own a minimal number of motor primitives but generate a maximal motor variability across trials thanks to variable activations of these primitives. A few months later, toddlers generate significantly less variability despite the existence of more primitives due to more regularity within their activation. These results suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration as soon as birth by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives that later fraction and become more consistently activated by the motor system.'
The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium (GTGC) is a new initiative that aims to bring together researchers and public health professionals to share and analyze data on the genetic diversity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the bacterium that causes typhoid fever. The GTGC has collected data from over 13,000 genomes of Typhi isolates from around the world, and has developed a new tool called GenoTyphi to help researchers analyze this data. The GTGC has also developed a new tool called Pathogenwatch to help public health professionals track the spread of Typhi and monitor the emergence of new strains with resistance to antibiotics. The GTGC is currently working to develop new tools to help researchers and public health professionals better understand the genetic diversity of Typhi and its resistance to antibiotics, and to develop new strategies for controlling the spread of typhoid fever.
 'Flowering is a crucial process for plant reproduction, and it is regulated by a complex network of genes and environmental cues. One of the most important environmental cues is temperature, which can trigger the floral-promotion process known as vernalization. In Arabidopsis thaliana, vernalization is achieved through the epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). In this study, the authors show that C-repeat/dehydration-responsive elements (CRT/DREs) at the 3′-end of FLC are required for cold-mediated expression of COOLAIR, an antisense RNA transcribed from the FLC locus. They also show that CBFs, which are cold-induced antisense RNA transcribed from the FLC locus, bind to CRT/DREs at the 3′-end of FLC both in vitro and in vivo. The authors demonstrate that COOLAIR is induced by CBFs during early stages of vernalization but COOLAIR levels decrease in later phases as FLC chromatin transitions to an inactive state to which CBFs can no longer bind. The authors also show that cbfs and FLCΔCOOLAIR mutants exhibit a normal vernalization response despite their inability to activate COOLAIR expression during cold, revealing that COOLAIR is not required for the vernalization process. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the cold-mediated regulation of FLC and COOLAIR during vernalization.'
 'HIV-1 reservoir cells that circulate in peripheral blood during suppressive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) have been well characterized, but little is known about the dissemination of HIV-1-infected cells across multiple anatomical tissues, especially the CNS . In this study, the authors performed single-genome, near full-length HIV-1 next-generation sequencing to evaluate the proviral landscape in distinct anatomical compartments, including multiple CNS tissues, from 3 ART-treated participants at autopsy. They found that lymph nodes and, to a lesser extent, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tissues represented tissue hotspots for the persistence of intact proviruses. However, they also observed intact proviruses in CNS tissue sections, particularly in the basal ganglia. Multi-compartment dissemination of clonal intact and defective proviral sequences occurred across multiple anatomical tissues, including the CNS, and evidence for the clonal proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells was found in the basal ganglia, in the frontal lobe, in the thalamus, and in periventricular white matter. These findings will be informative for advancing HIV-1 cure strategies.'
 'Circadian rhythms' are daily patterns of behavior and physiology that are controlled by a 'circadian clock' in the brain. These rhythms are important for many aspects of health, including sleep, metabolism, and hormone production. In humans, disruptions to circadian rhythms have been linked to a variety of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and depression. To study how circadian rhythms work and how they are disrupted, scientists need to be able to monitor the activity of the circadian clock in different parts of the body. However, this is difficult because the clock is active in many different cells and tissues at the same time. To solve this problem, researchers have developed a new tool called 'Locally Activatable BioLuminescence' (LABL). This tool allows scientists to monitor the activity of the circadian clock in specific cells and tissues in real time. Using LABL, researchers have discovered that different parts of the body have different patterns of circadian activity. This could help scientists understand how circadian rhythms are disrupted in different diseases and how to treat them.
 'Membrane trafficking is a crucial process for cells to transport proteins and lipids to different parts of the cell. This process involves several steps, including cargo sorting, Rab-family GTPase activation, membrane tethering, and SNARE protein binding. VPS9-domain GEFs are important regulators of endosomal function that activate endosomal Rab5-like GTPases. In yeast, the VPS9-domain GEFs Muk1 and Vps9 stimulate the endosomal Rabs Vps21, Ypt52, and Ypt53 to perform downstream functions. Sorting nexins (SNXs) are a conserved family of proteins that perform direct roles in endosomal trafficking by binding to transmembrane cargo proteins and enriching them into sorting domains. SNX-BARs are a sub-family of SNXs that contain a Bin/Amphiphysin/RVS (BAR) domain that mediates dimerization with other BAR domain-containing proteins and imparts membrane binding/deforming properties. The VINE complex is a new coat complex that was discovered in this study. It consists of the SNX-BAR protein Ykr078w/Vin1 and the VPS9-domain GEF Vrl1. The VINE complex is important for endosomal trafficking and may operate alongside other coat complexes such as retromer, Mvp1, and Snx4. The discovery of the VINE complex provides new insights into the mechanisms of endosomal trafficking and may have implications for human health.
 'Interspecific interactions are key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of ecological communities. However, tracking and quantifying interactions of marine fish species are practically difficult, especially under field conditions. In this study, we performed quantitative fish environmental DNA ( eDNA ) metabarcoding on 550 seawater samples collected twice a month from 11 coastal sites for 2 years in the Boso Peninsula, Japan, and analyzed eDNA monitoring data using nonlinear time series analytical tools. We detected fish–fish interactions as information flow between eDNA time series, reconstructed interaction networks for the top 50 frequently detected species, and quantified pairwise, fluctuating interaction strengths. Although there was a large variation, water temperature influenced fish–fish interaction strengths. The impact of water temperature on interspecific interaction strengths varied among fish species, suggesting that fish species identity influences the temperature effects on interactions. For example, interaction strengths that Halichoeres tenuispinis and Microcanthus strigatus received strongly increased with water temperature, while those of Engraulis japonicus and Girella punctata decreased with water temperature. An increase in water temperature induced by global climate change may change fish interactions in a complex way, which consequently influences marine community dynamics and stability. Our research demonstrates a practical research framework to study the effects of environmental variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature, which would contribute to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.'
 'The avian palaeognath phylogeny has been recently revised significantly due to the advancement of genome-wide comparative analyses and provides the opportunity to trace the evolution of the microstructure and crystallography of modern dinosaur eggshells . Here , eggshells of all major clades of Palaeognathae ( including extinct taxa ) and selected eggshells of Neognathae and non-avian dinosaurs are analyzed with electron backscatter diffraction. Our results show the detailed microstructures and crystallographies of ( previously ) loosely categorized ostrich- , rhea- , and tinamou-style morphotypes of palaeognath eggshells. All rhea-style eggshell appears homologous, while respective ostrich-style and tinamou-style morphotypes are best interpreted as homoplastic morphologies ( independently acquired ) . Ancestral state reconstruction and parsimony analysis additionally show that rhea-style eggshell represents the ancestral state of palaeognath eggshells both in microstructure and crystallography. The ornithological and palaeontological implications of the current study are not only helpful for the understanding of evolution of modern and extinct dinosaur eggshells, but also aid other disciplines where palaeognath eggshells provide useful archive for comparative contrasts ( e.g. palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, geochronology, and zooarchaeology ).'
 'Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)' are sounds that many animals, including rodents, use for communication and navigation. Researchers have been studying USVs in mice to understand their social and affective significance, and to use them as a behavioral measure in neurodevelopmental and neurolinguistic research. However, accurately attributing USVs to their emitter during close interactions has been a difficult and key challenge. The authors present a hybrid ultrasonic tracking system, Hybrid Vocalization Localizer (HyVL), that synergistically integrates a high-resolution acoustic camera with high-quality ultrasound microphones. HyVL is the first to achieve millimeter precision (~3.4–4.8 mm, 91% assigned) in localizing USVs, ~3× better than other systems, approaching the physical limits (mouse snout ~10 mm). The authors analyze mouse courtship interactions and demonstrate that males and females vocalize in starkly different relative spatial positions, and that the fraction of female vocalizations has likely been overestimated previously due to imprecise localization. Further, when two male mice interact with one female, one of the males takes a dominant role in the interaction both in terms of the vocalization rate and the location relative to the female. HyVL substantially improves the precision with which social communication between rodents can be studied. It is also affordable, open-source, easy to set up, can be integrated with existing setups, and reduces the required number of experiments and animals.
 'Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction that produce force in all striated muscles. The nanoarchitecture of sarcomeres is determined by the large titin protein, which spans from the Z-disc to the M-band in vertebrates. However, the role of titin in determining sarcomere architecture outside of vertebrates is not well understood. In this study, the authors used nanobodies to determine the precise location of two titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, in the sarcomeres of Drosophila flight muscles. They found that Sallimus bridges across the flight muscle I-band, while Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band. The ends of both proteins overlap at the I-band/A-band border, revealing a staggered organization of the two titin homologs. This architecture may help to stably anchor Sallimus at the myosin filament and ensure efficient force transduction during flight. The findings of this study provide important insights into the nanoarchitecture of sarcomeres in non-vertebrate animals and may help to explain how high mechanical tension can be stably transmitted across the sarcomere.'
 'We present a simple and low-cost method for measuring the viscoelastic properties of individual cells. The method uses a microfluidic device to apply shear stress to cells suspended in a high-viscosity fluid. The resulting deformations of the cells are captured using a camera and analyzed to extract the storage and loss moduli of the cells. The method is accurate and can be used to study the viscoelastic properties of cells in a variety of contexts, including drug testing and disease diagnosis.'
 'Mitochondria are essential for cardiac function, but the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in isolated cardiomyopathy is not well understood. In this study, the authors found that a rare mitofusin (MFN) 2 mutation, R400Q, is over-represented in clinical cardiomyopathy but not in peripheral neuropathy. They then investigated the enzymatic, biophysical, and functional characteristics of MFN2 Q400 versus wild-type and CMT2A-causing MFN2 mutants. All MFN2 mutants had impaired mitochondrial fusion, but MFN2 R400Q was uniquely defective in recruiting Parkin to mitochondria. CRISPR editing of the R400Q mutation into the mouse Mfn2 gene induced perinatal cardiomyopathy with no other organ involvement. RNA sequencing and metabolomics of cardiomyopathic Mfn2 Q/Q400 hearts revealed signature abnormalities recapitulating experimental mitophagic cardiomyopathy. Indeed, cultured cardiomyoblasts and in vivo cardiomyocytes expressing MFN2 Q400 had mitophagy defects with increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. The authors propose that MFN2 R400Q is the first known natural mitophagy-defective MFN2 mutant and that its unique profile of dysfunction evokes mitophagic cardiomyopathy, suggesting a mechanism for enrichment in clinical cardiomyopathy. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyopathy and for developing new therapies for this disease.'
 'Researchers have found that the lifespan of female mice can be increased by exposure to odors from adult females, but not from males. The study suggests that olfactory cues may have a sex-specific effect on lifespan in mice, and that early-life experiences may have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later life. The findings provide support for the idea that very young mice are susceptible to influences that can have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later life, and provide a potential example of lifespan extension by olfactory cues in mice.'
 'Chemogenetics is a powerful tool for studying the role of specific neuronal populations in sleep regulation. However, the effects of commonly used chemogenetic actuators, such as clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), on sleep have never been systematically tested. In this study, the authors found that intraperitoneal injections of commonly used CNO doses (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) altered sleep in wild-type male laboratory mice. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to analyze sleep, the authors found a dose-dependent suppression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, changes in EEG spectral power during NREM sleep, and altered sleep architecture in a pattern previously reported for clozapine. The authors suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators. This study highlights the importance of including a DREADD-free control group in chemogenetic experiments to ensure that any observed effects are not due to the actuator itself.'
 'Microorganisms sense and respond to chemical gradients in their environment, which is essential for processes such as nutrient uptake, chemorepulsion from toxins, and microbial pathogenesis. Microfluidic devices have been used to study microbial chemotaxis, but they have limitations in terms of throughput and versatility. In this study, the authors developed a novel microfluidic multiplexed chemotaxis device (MCD) that uses serial dilution to simultaneously perform six parallel bacterial chemotaxis assays that span five orders of magnitude in chemostimulant concentration on a single chip. The MCD was validated and compared to a standard microfluidic assay. The device's versatility was assessed by quantifying the chemotactic responses of different bacteria to different chemoattractants and chemorepellents. The MCD vastly accelerates the chemotactic screening process, which is critical to deciphering the complex sea of chemical stimuli underlying microbial responses.'
 'Neural crest cells are a group of cells that play a crucial role in the development of the nervous system and other tissues in vertebrates. These cells undergo a series of events, including induction, specification, and migration, to form the tissues they will become. Recent research has shown that post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the development of neural crest cells. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from avian embryos, researchers identified Elavl1 as a potential post-transcriptional regulator that is enriched in newly formed neural crest cells. Elavl1 is a member of the ELAV family of RNA-binding proteins that have been shown to play important roles in neural development. The researchers used unilateral knockdown of Elavl1 in chick embryos to investigate its role in neural crest specification. They found that Elavl1 knockdown led to premature neural crest delamination and a significant reduction in the expression of genes within the neural crest specification GRN. The researchers also found that Draxin, a direct mRNA target for stabilization by Elavl1, was the primary target for stabilization by Elavl1 during cranial neural crest specification. These findings suggest that Elavl1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of cranial neural crest specification via Draxin mRNA stabilization. The researchers’ work highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in the development of neural crest cells and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying neural crest specification.'
 'Respiration is a vital process for life, and the neural circuits that control it are essential. The preBötzinger complex (preBötC) in the brainstem generates the rhythm and pattern of breathing, and the phrenic motor column (PMC) in the spinal cord provides the final motor output that drives diaphragm muscle contractions during inspiration. Despite their critical function, the principles that dictate how these circuits assemble are unknown. In this study, the authors show that coordinated activity of a type I cadherin (N-cadherin) and type II cadherins (Cadherin-6, -9, and -10) is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output. Both MN- and Dbx1-specific cadherin inactivation in mice during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. The authors find that cadherins establish phrenic MN cell body positioning and dendritic orientation, but surprisingly find that cell body positioning is likely dispensable for proper phrenic MN firing. The study demonstrates that cadherins are vital to respiratory circuit assembly and function and suggests a model where cadherin-mediated adhesive recognition dictates wiring specificity through multifaceted functions in dendritic organization and molecular recognition.'
 'Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media platforms, contributing to polarization, racism, and vaccine hesitancy. A new study suggests that the incentive structure of these platforms, where social rewards are dissociated from the veracity of the information shared, facilitates the spread of misinformation. The study tested 951 participants over six experiments and found that a slight change to the incentive structure, such that social rewards and punishments are contingent on information veracity, produces a considerable increase in the discernment of shared information. The results offer evidence for an intervention that could be adopted to reduce misinformation spread, without reducing engagement, which in turn could reduce violence, vaccine hesitancy, and political polarization.'
 'Microtubules are dynamic polymers that play a crucial role in intracellular transport and cell division. During mitosis, chromosomes are pulled apart by disassembling microtubules that are attached to the kinetochores on the chromosomes. The conformational wave hypothesis suggests that the force generated by these disassembling microtubules is due to the curling of protofilaments, which are the building blocks of microtubules. In this study, the authors directly measured the mechanical work output generated by curling protofilaments in vitro. They found that the work output can be increased by adding magnesium and that yeast microtubules generate larger and more energetic working strokes than bovine microtubules. Both the magnesium and species-dependent increases in work output can be explained by lengthening the protofilament curls without changing their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. These observations demonstrate how work output from curling protofilaments can be tuned and suggest evolutionary conservation of the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubule lattice.'
 'Hagfishes are a group of jawless vertebrates that produce a unique form of defense against predators by rapidly ejecting threads and mucus into seawater. These threads and mucus form a fibrous hydrogel that entraps large volumes of water and effectively clogs the mouth and gills of fish predators. The threads are produced by specialized cells called gland thread cells (GTCs) that are found in slime glands along the body of the hagfish. However, a recent study found that similar thread-producing cells called epidermal thread cells (ETCs) are also found in the epidermis of hagfishes. The study found that ETCs produce shorter threads than those produced by GTCs, but these threads are still present within the epidermis over the entire body of the hagfish. When the skin of a hagfish is damaged, the damaged epidermis releases an adhesive and fibrous slime that contains threads and granules released from ruptured ETCs. Comparative transcriptome analysis from skin and slime glands, together with phylogenetic analysis of α and γ protein sequences, revealed that the thread proteins expressed in hagfish skin are evolutionary sisters to those found in slime glands, with gene duplication and divergence generating a diversity of thread genes uniquely expressed in slime glands. Based on these data, the study hypothesized that slime glands might have arisen from epidermis, and that the selective pressures that drove this transition may have been related to the need for stronger and more voluminous slime.'
 'Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common form of drug-resistant epilepsy that affects adults and can lead to severe cognitive and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Current treatments are only symptomatic and do not mitigate the severity, progression, or outcome of the epilepsy. Sodium selenate is a potential disease-modifying treatment that has shown anti-epileptogenic effects in animal models of TLE. In this study, sodium selenate was administered to rats with KA-induced SE for 4 weeks. The results showed that sodium selenate treatment was associated with reduced seizures, cognitive and sensorimotor deficits, and increased PP2A expression and reduced hyperphosphorylated tau. The study also used network medicine and bioinformatics approaches to identify relevant molecular pathways associated with the disease-modifying effects of sodium selenate. Overall, the results suggest that sodium selenate may be a promising disease-modifying treatment for TLE.'
 'Fragility fractures are a direct consequence of osteoporosis and are associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, mortality is not part of doctor-patient communication about treatment or risk assessment. In this study, the authors introduce a new concept called "Skeletal Age" to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual. They used the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register to determine the hazard of mortality associated with a specific fracture for a given risk profile and then transformed it into years of life lost (YLL) using the Gompertz law of mortality. During the median follow-up period of 16 years, there had been 307,870 fractures and 122,744 post-fracture deaths. A fracture was associated with between 1 and 7 years of life lost, with the loss being greater in men than women. Hip fractures incurred the greatest loss of life years. The authors estimated "Skeletal Age" for each age and fracture site stratified by gender. They propose "Skeletal Age" as a new metric to assess the impact of a fragility fracture on an individual's life expectancy. This approach will enhance doctor-patient risk communication about the risks associated with osteoporosis.'
 'Brain tissue extraction is a crucial step in analyzing brain structure and function using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data. However, there are no generalizable methods to extract brain tissues across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. Therefore, developing a flexible and generalizable method for extracting whole brain tissue across species would allow researchers to analyze and compare experiment results more efficiently. Here, we propose a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network, named the Brain Extraction Net ( BEN ), to extract brain tissues across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. We have evaluated BEN on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six MR scanners with various magnetic field strengths. Compared to conventional toolboxes, the superiority of BEN is illustrated by its robustness, accuracy, and generalizability. Our proposed method not only provides a generalized solution for extracting brain tissue across species but also significantly improves the accuracy of atlas registration, thereby benefiting the downstream processing tasks. As a novel fully automated deep-learning method, BEN is designed as an open-source software to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications.'
 'Candida albicans is a fungal pathogen that can cause infections in humans. To survive in the host environment, C. albicans needs to acquire iron from various sources. One of the sources of iron for C. albicans is heme, which is found in hemoglobin. C. albicans expresses a family of extracellular hemophores that capture heme from host proteins and transfer it across the cell wall to the cell membrane, where it is endocytosed and utilized as heme or iron source. In this study, the authors identified two proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, that are required for heme utilization and sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. These proteins are related to ferric reductases and are involved in heme trafficking. The authors conclude that Frp1 and Frp2 form a functional complex that evolved from ferric reductases to enable extracellular heme uptake.'
 'The seventh pandemic of cholera disease is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Its environmental persistence allows for recurring sudden outbreaks. The sensory proteins ToxR and ToxS are located at the inner membrane and react to environmental stimuli like bile acid. ToxR and ToxS form a complex that is important for survival strategies, including bile resistance and virulence regulation. The crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS, combined with multiple bile acid interaction studies, reveals that a bile binding pocket of ToxS is only properly folded upon binding to ToxR. This suggests an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. The presented data supports the previously suggested link between ToxRS and VtrAC-like co-component systems. The ToxRS complex exhibits remarkable conservation across various Vibrio species, emphasizing its significance. Unravelling the intricate mechanisms governing ToxRS’s environmental sensing capabilities provides a promising tool for disruption of this vital interaction, ultimately inhibiting Vibrio’s survival and virulence.'
The hippocampus is a key brain structure involved in memory formation and consolidation. Recent studies have highlighted functional differences along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. In this study, the authors used track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior–posterior axis of the in vivo human hippocampus. They first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, they characterized where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Their results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, their results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in vivo and inform our understanding of the neural architecture that underpins hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.
 'Inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major driver for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) responds to cytoplasmic dsDNA as part of the innate immunity defense against viral pathogens. STING binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and activates the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-κB). Inflammasomes are major signaling hubs that activate caspase-1 and control the bioactivity of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the interleukin (IL)-1 family. The cGAS-STING pathway has been implicated in PD pathogenesis. Mice deficient for the PD-associated proteins PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK) and parkin show a STING-mediated inflammatory phenotype after exhaustive exercise. Cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43, which constitutes the most common pathological finding in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA and the consecutive, STING-dependent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Mutations in TBK1 are associated with familial ALS. To determine whether specific activation of STING is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration, the authors used a mouse model with heterozygous expression of the STING genetic variant N153S. Constitutively active STING mutants cause an autoinflammatory disease in humans termed STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy. Major features of systemic inflammation in SAVI are recapitulated in STING N153S knock-in mice. The authors focused on dopaminergic neurons because they have been the center of their investigations and because STING has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. They determined the extent of neuroinflammation and quantified the integrity of dopaminergic neurons that project from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum. They found that the number of dopaminergic neurons was smaller than in controls, as was the density of dopaminergic axon terminals and the concentration of dopamine in the striatum. They also observed alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation was quantified by staining astroglia and microglia, by measuring mRNAs, proteins, and nuclear translocation of transcription factors. These neuroinflammatory markers were already elevated in juvenile mice although at this age the number of dopaminergic neurons was still unaffected, thus preceding the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. More neuroinflammatory markers were blunted in mice deficient for inflammasomes than in mice deficient for signaling by type I interferons. Neurodegeneration, however, was blunted in both mice. The authors conclude that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Targeting the STING pathway could therefore be beneficial in Parkinson’s disease and further neurodegenerative diseases.'
 'Immunotherapy is a promising treatment for cancer, but it often fails to eradicate tumors. Researchers have found that tumor cells can evade immunotherapy by forming unique cell-in-cell structures that are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. These structures are formed by IFNγ-activated T cells, which induce phosphorylation of transcription factors in tumor cells. Inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. This work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism that enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity.'
 'Theory of Mind (ToM)' refers to the ability to understand and attribute mental states to others. This ability has been extensively studied in humans, but less is known about how nonhuman primates process mental states. In this study, researchers used eye-tracking and fMRI to investigate how marmosets process Frith-Happé animations, which feature simple geometric shapes moving either randomly or in a way that suggests one shape is reacting to the other's mental state. The researchers found that both humans and marmosets fixated longer on the triangle that appeared to be reacting to the other's mental state, but marmosets did not show the same overall fixation pattern as humans. However, both species activated similar brain regions when viewing the ToM animations compared to random animations, suggesting that they differentiate between these scenarios similarly. This study provides new insights into the cognitive abilities of marmosets and expands our understanding of ToM processing in nonhuman primates.'
 'Expression of genes that promote stemness or differentiation must be properly controlled in stem cells to allow their progeny to transition through various intermediate stages of cell fate specification in a timely fashion. However, mechanistic understanding of the fine-tuning of gene transcription is lacking due to the compensatory effect of translational control. The authors used intermediate neural progenitor ( INP ) identity commitment to define the mechanisms that fine-tune stemness gene transcription in fly neural stem cells ( neuroblasts ). They found that the transcription factor FruitlessC ( FruC ) binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in neuroblasts. Loss of fruC function alone has no effect on INP commitment but drives INP dedifferentiation when translational control is reduced. FruC negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. Identical to fruC loss-of-function, reducing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 activity increases stemness gene activity. The authors propose that low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.'
 'Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs naturally in the body to remove damaged or old cells. This process is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing inflammation. However, the clearance of apoptotic cells is not well understood. In this study, the authors found that neutrophils, not macrophages as previously thought, are the predominant phagocytes responsible for the clearance of apoptotic hepatic cells in the steady state. They found that neutrophils burrowed directly into apoptotic hepatocytes and ingested them from the inside, a process they termed perforocytosis. The authors also found that the depletion of neutrophils caused defective removal of apoptotic bodies, which led to tissue injury in the mouse liver and the generation of autoantibodies. They also found that human autoimmune liver disease showed similar defects in the neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic hepatic cells. The authors concluded that neutrophils possess a specialized immunologically silent mechanism for the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes through perforocytosis, and defects in this key housekeeping function of neutrophils contribute to the genesis of autoimmune liver disease.'
 'Motor neurons are responsible for controlling the movement of muscles in the body. They receive input from other neurons, called interneurons, which process information and send it to motor neurons. The way that interneurons are organized in the spinal cord is thought to help them process information efficiently. However, a recent study found that interneurons controlling different muscles are not organized in separate regions of the spinal cord, as previously thought. Instead, they are mixed together. This means that interneurons may need to find the right motor neuron to send information to, even though they are not in the same part of the spinal cord. This could make it more difficult for the spinal cord to process information efficiently. Further research is needed to understand how the spinal cord processes information with these mixed interneurons.'
 'Respiration can induce motion and CO2 fluctuation during resting-state fMRI ( rsfMRI ) scans , which will lead to non-neural artifacts in the rsfMRI signal . In the meantime , as a crucial physiologic process , respiration can directly drive neural activity change in the brain , and may thereby modulate the rsfMRI signal . Nonetheless , this potential neural component in the respiration–fMRI relationship is largely unexplored . To elucidate this issue , here we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology , rsfMRI , and respiration signals in rats . Our data show that respiration is indeed associated with neural activity changes , evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrophysiological signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex . Intriguingly , slow respiration variations are also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network , which is mediated by gamma-band neural activity . In addition , this respiration-related brain network disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced at an isoelectrical state , while the respiration is maintained , further confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network . Taken together , this study identifies a respiration-related brain network underpinned by neural activity , which represents a novel component in the respiration–rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts . It opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between respiration , neural activity , and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions .'
 'Predators that hunt multiple prey types often switch between hunting strategies depending on the availability and profitability of different prey types. In this study, researchers used biologging tags and DNA metabarcoding of feces to investigate the foraging strategies of greater mouse-eared bats, which hunt both ground-dwelling and aerial insects. The researchers found that the bats use two foraging strategies, with similar average nightly captures of 25 small, aerial insects and 29 large, ground-dwelling insects per bat. However, owing to the 3–20 times larger ground prey, 85% of the nightly food acquisition comes from ground prey despite the 2.5 times higher failure rates. The researchers also found that most bats use the same foraging strategy on a given night, suggesting that bats adapt their hunting behavior to weather and ground conditions. The researchers conclude that these bats use high risk-high gain gleaning of ground prey as a primary foraging tactic but switch to aerial hunting when environmental changes reduce the profitability of ground prey, showing that prey switching matched to environmental dynamics plays a key role in covering the energy intake even in specialized predators.'
 'The evolution of human right-handedness has been a topic of intense debate for decades. Researchers have studied the hand preferences of various primate species to better understand the origins of human right-handedness. However, previous studies have been limited by small sample sizes and inconsistent methodologies. In this study, the authors combined original data with published literature reports to create a dataset of hand preferences for standardized object manipulation in 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans. They then used quantitative phylogenetic methods to test various hypotheses on the evolution of primate handedness. The authors found that human right-handedness is an extreme among anthropoids and that species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates. They also found that the strength of hand preference varied widely among species and that this variation was correlated with brain size and ecology. These findings challenge popular ideas about the evolution of human handedness and suggest that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species.'
 'Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and heart. It is characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and hypersocial behavior. There are currently no treatments for WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a signaling system that plays a role in both cognitive and cardiovascular function. In this study, researchers analyzed the ECS in a mouse model of WBS and found that the ECS was dysregulated. They then treated the mice with a drug that inhibits the breakdown of endocannabinoids and found that it improved the cognitive and cardiovascular deficits in the mice. These findings suggest that the ECS could be a potential target for treating WBS.
 'During development, an organism goes through different stages that are characterized by distinct morphological and molecular changes. In humans, for example, development progresses from childhood through puberty to adulthood. Similarly, in holometabolous insects such as Drosophila melanogaster, the developmental stages are sharply defined: embryogenesis gives rise to the larva, a juvenile stage, which, upon different rounds of growth and moulting, brings about the pupa, when most of the larval cells die and the adult progenitor cells (imaginal cells) develop to generate the adult organism. The regulation of stage-specific differences is mediated by the action of two major developmental hormones, the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone and the terpenoid juvenile hormone. Both hormones exert this precise developmental control by regulating the expression of three critical genes that encode for the stage-identity factors that compose the metamorphic gene network: Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), Ecdysone inducible protein 93F (E93), and Broad-complex (Br-C; also known as broad), a member of the bric-a-brac-tramtrack-broad family. The deployment of the pupal-specific genetic program is controlled by the expression of Br-C at the larval-pupal transition. Upon the formation of the pupa, hormone signalling triggers the expression of the helix-turn-helix factor E93, whose product represses Br-C expression and directs the formation of the final differentiated adult structures. While it is firmly established that Br-C and E93 are the stage-specifying genes for the pupal and adult states, the nature of the larval specifying gene has been elusive. To date, larval identity has been attributed to Kr-h1, which is present during the larval period and represses Br-C and E93 expression during this period. However, although Kr-h1 is undoubtedly critical for maintaining the larval state, evidence has shown that this factor cannot be considered the larval specifier per se. For example, depletion of Kr-h1 in Drosophila does not prevent normal larval development nor a timely transition to the pupa. In this regard, the product of chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis (chinmo) gene, another member of the BTB family of transcription factors, has been recently proposed to be responsible for larval identity in Drosophila. First isolated based on its requirement for the temporal identity of mushroom body neurons (Zhu et al., 2006), the identification of Chinmo as a more general larval specifier has provided invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of juvenile identity. Yet, little is known about how this factor exerts its function along with Br-C and E93. Moreover, in the sequential activation of chinmo, Br-C, and E93, the extent of the activity directly attributable to each transcription factor or to their mutual repression is still unclear. Here, we confirm the role of chinmo as larval specifier in larval and imaginal cells and establish its regulatory interactions with the other temporal specifiers. We also examine how the temporal sequence of Chinmo and Br-C differently affects with the genetic program that establishes larval vs. imaginal identity. Thus, we found that Chinmo controls larval development of larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. According to these data, and in the context of the metamorphic gene network, we also show that chinmo absence is critical for the transition from larva to pupa and then to adult, as it acts as a repressor of both Br-C and E93. In addition, we report that the chinmo homologue has a similar role in the cockroach Blattella germanica, thereby indicating that its function as a juvenile specifier precedes the hemimetabolous/holometabolous split. Finally, we show that in contrast to the well-characterised role of chinmo as a pro-oncogene, the Br-C pupal and E93 adult specifiers act mainly as tumour suppressor genes. These characteristics are maintained beyond insects and may account for the different role of some human BTB-zinc finger transcription factors in tumourigenesis.'
 'Metabolism is a complex system of reactions that occur within cells to produce energy and other molecules necessary for life. The dynamics of these reactions are influenced by a variety of factors, including the availability of substrates, the activity of enzymes, and the overall structure of the metabolic network. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical framework to analyze the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux. Co-substrate cycling refers to the process of converting one form of a co-substrate (a molecule that is used in multiple reactions) into another form and back again. The authors found that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct from the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalyzing that reaction. Using analytical methods, the authors showed that this additional limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. The authors then used simulations to show that regulation of these two parameters can allow regulation of flux dynamics in branched and coupled pathways. The authors analyzed existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from the central carbon metabolism and identified several reactions that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. The authors conclude that measuring and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells.'
 'The origin and differentiation mechanism of articular chondrocytes, the cells that make up cartilage in joints, are not well understood. In this study, the authors found that a protein called NFATc1 is important for the differentiation of articular chondrocytes during development. NFATc1 is expressed in cells that give rise to articular chondrocytes, but not in cells that give rise to growth-plate chondrocytes. The authors also found that NFATc1 suppresses the differentiation of articular chondrocytes by regulating the expression of a gene called Col2a1. These findings provide new insights into the identity and origin of articular chondrocytes and the mechanisms that regulate their differentiation.'
 'Photosystem II (PSII) is a key enzyme in oxygenic photosynthesis that uses light energy to convert water into oxygen and reduce plastoquinone. Two types of PSII, Chl-d-PSII and Chl-f-PSII, can use far-red light to perform the same reactions with lower energy. Far-red PSII were predicted to lose photochemical efficiency and resilience to photodamage. Here, we compared enzyme turnover efficiency, forward electron transfer, back-reactions, and photodamage in Chl-f-PSII, Chl-d-PSII, and Chl-a-PSII. We found that Chl-d-PSII has a higher singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-f-PSII and Chl-a-PSII. Chl-f-PSII has a lower energy gap on the acceptor side, which favors resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage. The results suggest that far-red PSII have adapted to lower energy in two distinct ways, each appropriate for their specific environment but with different functional penalties.'
 'The skeletal system is a complex organ that plays a crucial role in movement, support, and immune responses. The skeletal system is made up of many different types of cells that work together to maintain its function. One of these cells is the osteocyte, which is a long-lived cell that is responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of bone and bone marrow. In this study, researchers used a mouse model to investigate the role of osteocytes in regulating the differentiation of bone and bone marrow cells. They found that osteocytes play a critical role in regulating the differentiation of bone and bone marrow cells by mediating senescence. This study provides important insights into the role of osteocytes in maintaining the function of the skeletal system and highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying cell differentiation and senescence.'
 'In the long-term evolution experiment ( LTEE ), 12 replicate populations of Escherichia coli have been evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations, we characterized the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across these 12 replicate populations. We found that all evolved lines had more mRNAs and that this increase in mRNA abundance scaled with cell size. Furthermore, despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations in the LTEE were remarkably similar in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The majority of the expression changes were due to changes at the transcriptional level, with very few translational changes. Finally, we showed how mutations in transcriptional regulators led to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.'
 'Liver regeneration is a process that occurs after liver damage or removal of part of the liver. It is a complex process that involves many different types of cells and signaling pathways. One of the key signaling pathways involved in liver regeneration is the Ras-Erk pathway. In this study, the authors found that when they removed a key molecule in this pathway called Shp2, liver regeneration was impaired. They also found that cells in the liver that were still able to divide after Shp2 removal had a protein called CD133 on their surface. CD133 is often thought of as a marker for stem cells, but the authors found that these cells were not stem cells. Instead, they were cells that had adapted to survive without the normal signals for cell division. The authors also found that these cells were able to communicate with each other and share information that helped them to survive. This study provides new insights into how cells are able to adapt and survive in the absence of normal signals for cell division.'
 'Ciliopathies are a group of diseases that affect the primary cilium, a microtubule-based organelle found in most cells. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision loss, kidney problems, and brain malformations. Retinal ciliopathies are a subtype of ciliopathies that specifically affect the retina, leading to vision loss. To identify drug candidates for treating retinal ciliopathies, researchers used high-throughput screening of over 6000 bioactive small molecules on retinal organoids differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells of rd16 mice, a model of Leber congenital amaurosis type 10. They identified five non-toxic positive hits, including the lead molecule reserpine, which maintained photoreceptor development and survival in rd16 organoids. Reserpine also improved photoreceptors in retinal organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of LCA10 patients and in rd16 mouse retina in vivo. Further investigation revealed that reserpine modulated signaling pathways related to cell survival/death, metabolism, and proteostasis. The study identified effective drug candidates in preclinical studies of CEP290 retinal ciliopathies through cross-species drug discovery using iPSC-derived organoids, highlighted the impact of proteostasis in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies, and provided new insights for treatments of retinal neurodegeneration.'
 'Bees are exposed to a variety of plant metabolites while foraging, including amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in almonds. While amygdalin is not toxic to bees at low concentrations, it can be converted into hydrogen cyanide, which is toxic. Bees may rely on their gut microbiota to help degrade amygdalin. In this study, the authors found that amygdalin can be degraded by both bees and their gut microbiota. The authors also identified specific strains of gut bacteria that can degrade amygdalin and found that one of these strains produces a glycoside hydrolase enzyme that can degrade amygdalin. These findings suggest that bees and their gut microbiota work together to degrade amygdalin and reduce its toxic effects.'
 'Candida albicans is a fungus that can cause severe invasive candidiasis in humans. The virulence factor candidalysin (CL) is secreted by C. albicans and causes damage to target cell membranes. However, the mechanism by which CL permeabilizes membranes is unclear. In this study, the authors reveal that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism. They propose that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer, which is sequentially added into a string configuration that can close into a loop. CL loops appear to spontaneously insert into the membrane to become pores. The authors also identify CL polymerization as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis. They use biophysical techniques such as mass photometry, native mass spectrometry, and atomic force microscopy to study CL pores and reveal that CL uses a previously unknown mechanism to damage membranes. Their findings not only unravel a new paradigm for the formation of membrane pores but also identify CL polymerization as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis.'
 'Precision medicine' is a new approach to treating diseases that involves tailoring treatments to individual patients based on their genetic and physiological characteristics. However, it is unclear how much of the improvement in treatment outcomes seen in precision medicine studies is due to the personalised treatment itself versus the contextual factors involved in the personalisation process. In this study, the authors tested whether presenting a placebo analgesia machine as personalised would improve its effectiveness. They recruited 102 adults to receive painful heat stimulations on their forearm. During half of the stimulations, a machine purportedly delivered an electric current to reduce their pain. The participants were either told that the machine was personalised to their genetics and physiology or that it was effective in reducing pain generally. The authors found that participants told that the machine was personalised reported more relief in pain intensity than the control group in both the feasibility study and the pre-registered double-blind confirmatory study. The authors suggest that their findings could potentially improve the methodology of precision medicine research and inform practice. This study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council and Genome Québec.
 'Shared lineage has diverse effects on patterns of neuronal connectivity. In mammalian cortex, excitatory sister neurons assemble into shared microcircuits. In Drosophila, in contrast, sister neurons with different levels of Notch expression (NotchON/NotchOFF) develop distinct identities and diverge into separate circuits. Notch-differentiated sister neurons have been observed in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but whether they integrate into shared or distinct circuits remains unknown. Here, we evaluate how sister V2a (NotchOFF) /V2b (NotchON) neurons in the zebrafish integrate into spinal circuits. Using an in vivo labeling approach, we identified pairs of sister V2a/b neurons born from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and observed that they have somata in close proximity to each other and similar axonal trajectories. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics revealed that sister V2a/b neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. These results resemble the divergent connectivity in Drosophila and represent the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.'
 'Neuronal networks are designed to maintain stable firing rates despite changes in synaptic drive. This is achieved through homeostatic plasticity, a set of mechanisms that adjust the intrinsic excitability of neurons and the strength and number of synapses. However, if these mechanisms are activated inappropriately or excessively, they can lead to seizures. In this study, the authors discovered that the PARbZIP family of transcription factors, HLF and TEF, negatively regulate homeostatic plasticity. In mice lacking all three PARbZIP family members, the response to prolonged activity withdrawal is much stronger, while baseline activity remains unchanged. Whole-cell recordings revealed an exaggerated increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents, reflecting enhanced upregulation of recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission. Genetic analyses revealed that HLF and TEF are critical for constraining plasticity and preventing seizures. These findings suggest that transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but is also involved in restraint of the response to activity deprivation.'
 'The lung is a complex organ that plays a crucial role in gas exchange in the body. The development of the lung is a highly regulated process that involves the coordination of various signaling pathways and transcription factors. In this study, the authors used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility sequencing to analyze the development of SOX9+ progenitor cells in the lung. They found that SOX9+ cells are multipotent at early stages of development, but later become selective progenitors of alveolar epithelial cells. The authors also identified a common regulatory network that controls the development of SOX9+ progenitor cells, which includes the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium resulted in an expansion of the SOX9+ progenitor cell population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation. These findings highlight the importance of PI3K signaling in the development of the lung and emphasize the power of combining RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility sequencing to understand the complex regulatory networks that control development.'
 'Working memory ( WM ) is a cognitive domain that is often affected in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The slot model of WM, which assumes a limited number of items can be stored in a binary format, has been widely used to study WM in MS. However, recent studies using analog recall paradigms have shown that the resource-based model, which assumes dynamic allocation of WM resources, provides more accurate predictions of WM performance. In this study, two continuous reproduction paradigms, memory-guided localization ( MGL ) and analog recall task with sequential presentation, were used to investigate WM dysfunction in MS. The results showed an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS. While sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy control from relapsing-remitting MS, MGL were more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes ( relapsing-remitting from secondary progressive ). Furthermore, computational modeling of the results from the sequential paradigm determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error ( mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items ) were responsible for WM dysfunction in MS. Overall, this study provided new insights into the organization of the WM system in MS population and offered a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit.'
 'Nociception is a process that animals have developed to avoid potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. While nociception is triggered in the peripheral nervous system, its modulation by the central nervous system is a critical process in mammals, whose dysfunction has been extensively implicated in chronic pain pathogenesis. The peripheral mechanisms of nociception are largely conserved across the animal kingdom. However, it is unclear whether the brain-mediated modulation is also conserved in non-mammalian species. Here, we show that Drosophila has a descending inhibitory mechanism of nociception from the brain, mediated by the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) that plays an important role in the descending control of nociception in mammals. We found that mutants lacking dsk or its receptors are hypersensitive to noxious heat. Through a combination of genetic, behavioral, histological, and Ca2+ imaging analyses, we subsequently revealed neurons involved in DSK-mediated nociceptive regulation at a single-cell resolution and identified a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system, raising the possibility that the descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception.'
 'Plants often produce secondary metabolites as defense mechanisms against parasites . Some fungi may be able to overcome these barriers by detoxifying the compounds, but only a limited number of examples and molecular mechanisms have been reported . In this study, the authors found an Aglaia plant-parasitizing fungus that overcomes the toxicity of rocaglates, which are translation inhibitors synthesized by the plant, through an amino acid substitution in a eukaryotic translation initiation factor ( eIF ) . The fungus belongs to the Ophiocordyceps genus and its eIF4A, a molecular target of rocaglates, harbors an amino acid substitution critical for rocaglate binding. Ribosome profiling harnessing a cucumber-infecting fungus, Colletotrichum orbiculare, demonstrated that the translational inhibitory effects of rocaglates were largely attenuated by the mutation found in the Aglaia parasite. The engineered C . orbiculare showed a survival advantage on cucumber plants with rocaglates. The study exemplifies a plant–fungus tug-of-war centered on secondary metabolites produced by host plants.'
 'Psychophysical methods are used to measure mental phenomena such as perception and cognition. They involve controlled experiments and rigorous analysis through signal detection theory. However, they require many tedious trials and preferably highly trained participants. A recently developed approach, continuous psychophysics, promises to transform the field by abandoning the rigid trial structure involving binary responses and replacing it with continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli. However, what has precluded wide adoption of this approach is that current analysis methods do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task and therefore recover perceptual thresholds that are larger compared to equivalent traditional psychophysical experiments. Here, we introduce a computational analysis framework for continuous psychophysics based on Bayesian inverse optimal control. We show via simulations and previously published data that this not only recovers the perceptual thresholds but also estimates subjects’ action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. Taken together, we provide further evidence for the importance of including acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and, crucially, the intrinsic costs of behavior, even in experiments seemingly only investigating perception. Our approach should be the preferred analysis technique for continuous psychophysics paradigms.'
 'Models of how the brain makes decisions have been based on the idea that decisions are made by accumulating evidence over time and then committing to a decision when the evidence reaches a certain threshold. However, these models have not taken into account the fact that the environment in which we make decisions can change over time. In this study, the authors developed a new model that takes into account how decisions are made in environments that change over time. They found that the optimal decision threshold changes over time in response to changes in the environment. The authors also found that these changes in decision threshold are adaptive and can improve decision-making performance. These findings provide new insights into how the brain makes decisions in dynamic environments.'
 'Biodiversity is essential for the functioning of ecosystems and human well-being. However, human activities are causing a rapid decline in biodiversity. To understand the impact of human activities on biodiversity, we developed a conceptual framework that links biodiversity dynamics to abiotic changes over time and space using artificial intelligence. We applied this framework to a freshwater ecosystem with a known history of human impact and studied 100 years of community-level biodiversity, climate change, and chemical pollution trends. We used explainable network models with multimodal learning to community-level functional biodiversity measured with multilocus metabarcoding, to establish correlations with biocides and climate change records. We found that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed over time without returning to its original state, even if the lake partially recovered in recent times. Insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. Our study advocates the use of high-throughput systemic approaches on long-term trends over species-focused ecological surveys to identify the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions.'
 'The brain receives outdated sensory information due to the time required for neural transmission and processing. In motion perception, the brain may overcome these delays by predictively encoding the position of moving objects using information from their past trajectories. In the present study, researchers used multivariate analysis of high temporal resolution electroencephalographic data to track neural position representations of moving objects at different stages of visual processing, relative to the real-time position of the object. During early stimulus-evoked activity, position representations of moving objects were activated substantially earlier than the equivalent activity evoked by unpredictable flashes, aligning the earliest representations of moving stimuli with their real-time positions. These findings indicate that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for the neural delays accumulated early in stimulus processing, but that delays still accumulate across later stages of cortical processing. The study provides the first direct evidence in humans that extrapolation processes allow the early visual system to localize moving objects in real time. The findings demonstrate the existence of significant predictive processing during motion perception, but constrain any predictive mechanisms to acting relatively early in processing.'
 'Humans are able to derive knowledge from language inputs, in addition to nonlinguistic sensory channels such as vision and touch. How does language experience modulate the mechanism by which semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain? We investigated this question using a unique human model with varying amounts and qualities of early language exposure: early deaf adults who were born to hearing parents and had reduced early exposure and delayed acquisition of any natural human language (speech or sign) , with early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth as the control group that matches on nonlinguistic sensory experiences. Neural responses in a semantic judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups were measured using fMRI. The deaf group with reduced early language exposure , compared with the deaf control group , showed reduced semantic sensitivity, in both multivariate pattern (semantic structure encoding) and univariate (abstractness effect) analyses, in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL). These results provide positive, causal evidence that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the dATL, highlighting the roles of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences. The findings also suggest that language experience may contribute to semantic development beyond sensory experiences by facilitating or modulating categorizations by the nature of labeling (i.e., words) to sensory experiences and/or by constructing semantic relations based on various types of word relations. The study provides positive evidence for the role of language experience in the formation of the identified neural semantic structures.'
 'Replay , the sequential reactivation of neuronal ensembles, is a central hippocampal mechanism postulated to drive memory processing. While both rate and place representations are used by hippocampal place cells to encode behavioral episodes, replay has been largely defined by only the latter—based on the fidelity of sequential activity across neighboring place fields. Here, we show that dorsal CA1 place cells in rats can modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts. This experience-dependent phenomenon mirrors the same pattern of rate modulation observed during behavior and can be used independently from place information within replay sequences to discriminate between contexts. Our results reveal the existence of two complementary neural representations available for memory processes.
 'Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders that affect the mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including infertility. In this study, researchers found that mice lacking a protein called PARL, which is involved in mitochondrial function, developed infertility due to a complete arrest of spermatogenesis during meiotic prophase I. This process was independent of neurodegeneration. The researchers also found that PARL-deficient spermatocytes had severe mitochondrial defects, including disrupted electron transfer chain defects, decreased coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, and metabolic rewiring. These mitochondrial defects were associated with a germ cell-specific decrease in GPX4 expression, leading to arrested spermatocytes undergoing ferroptosis, a regulated cell death modality characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. The researchers suggest that mitochondrial defects induced by PARL depletion act as an initiating trigger for ferroptosis in primary spermatocytes through simultaneous effects on GPX4 and CoQ, two major inhibitors of ferroptosis. These findings shed new light on the potential role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and male infertility, warranting further investigation.'
 'The liver is a vital organ that plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism. However, when the liver becomes damaged, it can lead to a condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by liver inflammation and scarring. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of FGF21 on NASH using a mouse model. They found that FGF21 prevented hepatic lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. FGF21 also blocked the activation of Kupffer cells, which are liver macrophages that contribute to liver inflammation, and reduced the presence of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic macrophages in the liver. The authors suggest that FGF21 may be a promising therapeutic for the treatment of NASH.'
The brain is incredibly complex and diverse, and scientists study it using a wide range of techniques and species. However, the extreme heterogeneity of neurophysiology experiments makes it difficult to integrate, reproduce, interchange, and reuse data. To address this challenge, a standard language for neurophysiology data and metadata is needed. The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data language is a standardized language for describing neurophysiology data that can co-evolve with neuroscience experiments. NWB is an open-source software that defines and modularizes the interdependent, yet separable, components of a data language. It enables unified description of neurophysiology data across diverse modalities and species. NWB exists in an ecosystem of data management, analysis, visualization, and archive tools. It is generally applicable to enhance discovery across biology through data FAIRness.
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) infections can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, loss of appetite, and excessive sleepiness. These responses are mediated by the brain and will normally disappear once the virus is cleared from the system. However, severe respiratory virus infections may cause long-lasting neurological disturbances, such as encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. The mechanisms behind these long-lasting changes are unknown. The hypothalamus is a central regulator of the homeostatic response during a viral challenge. To gain insight into the neuronal and non-neuronal molecular changes during an IAV infection, the authors intranasally infected mice with an H1N1 virus and extracted the brain at different time points. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the hypothalamus, they identified transcriptional effects in all identified cell populations. The snRNA-seq data showed the most pronounced transcriptional response at 3 days past infection, with a strong downregulation of genes across all cell types. General immune processes were mainly impacted in microglia, the brain resident immune cells, where the authors found increased numbers of cells expressing pro-inflammatory gene networks. In addition, they found that most neuronal cell populations downregulated genes contributing to the energy homeostasis in mitochondria and protein translation in the cytosol, indicating potential reduced cellular and neuronal activity. This might be a preventive mechanism in neuronal cells to avoid intracellular viral replication and attack by phagocytosing cells. The change of microglia gene activity suggests that this is complemented by a shift in microglia activity to provide increased surveillance of their surroundings. Overall, the authors suggest that the transcriptional changes in the hypothalamus during an IAV infection may contribute to the neurological disturbances seen after infection.'
 'Apical–basal cell polarity is a key regulator of epithelial tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression of cells within the follicular epithelium of Drosophila ovaries that had undergone apical–basal polarity loss. They identified distinct cell types and characterized their gene expression profiles. They also found that the oxidative stress-responsive Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway was enriched in the multilayered cells and that manipulating the expression of both Keap1 and Nrf2 regulated the invasiveness of collective Lgl-KD cells with significant F-actin remodeling. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of cells within the follicular epithelium of Drosophila ovaries that have undergone apical–basal polarity loss and identifies novel regulatory pathways that determine plasticity in the invading tumor.'
 'Humans learn about the environment either directly by interacting with it or indirectly by seeking information about it from social sources such as other people. The degree of confidence in the information obtained through either route should determine the impact that it has on adapting and changing behavior. In this study, the authors examined whether and how behavioral and neural computations differ during non-social learning as opposed to learning from social sources. They found that confidence judgments were more accurate and less changeable when they were made about social as opposed to non-social information sources. In addition, the authors found that univariate activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction more closely tracked confidence about social as opposed to non-social information sources. Furthermore, the multivariate patterns of activity in the same areas encoded identities of social information sources compared to non-social information sources. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms that support learning from social advice are at least partially specialized and distinct from those concerned with learning that is guided by non-social sources.'
'Synaptic communication is a complex process that involves the fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. This process is triggered by brief and local elevations of intracellular Ca2+, which are highly sensitive to neurotransmitter release. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sensitivity are unknown. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical model based on the molecular properties of synaptotagmin, a protein that confers the Ca2+ sensitivity of neurotransmitter exocytosis. The model relies on the assumptions that (1) synaptotagmin Ca2+/PI (4,5)P2 dual binding lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion, and (2) the effect of multiple synaptotagmins on the energy barrier is additive. The model reproduced the steep Ca2+ dependency of neurotransmitter release, indicating that allosterically stabilized Ca2+/PI (4,5)P2 dual binding enables synaptotagmins to exert their coordinated function in neurotransmission. The authors also explored the consequences of putative mutations affecting Ca2+/PI (4,5)P2 binding and allosteric coupling between the binding sites of both species. They suggest that changes in allostericity contribute to dominant negative effects. Moreover, dynamic changes of PI (4,5)P2 accessibility for the syts (e.g., induced by SV movement to the plasma membrane) are predicted to dramatically impact synaptic responses. The authors conclude that allosterically stabilized Ca2+/PI (4,5)P2 dual binding to the C2B domain forms the molecular basis for synaptotagmins to exert their cooperative control of neurotransmitter release.'
'Sauropterygia was a diverse group of marine reptiles that lived from the Early Triassic to the Late Cretaceous. They are traditionally divided into two groups: short-necked, durophagous Placodontia and long-necked Eosauropterygia. However, recent research has shown that Saurosphargidae, a small clade of armored marine reptiles, is the sauropterygian sister-group. In this study, the authors report a new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic of South China, representing the earliest known occurrence of the clade. An updated phylogenetic analysis focussing on the interrelationships among diapsid reptiles recovers saurosphargids as nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. The phylogenetic position of several Early and Middle Triassic sauropterygians of previously uncertain phylogenetic affinity, such as Atopodentatus, Hanosaurus, Majiashanosaurus, and Corosaurus, is also clarified. The study provides evidence for the rapid diversification of sauropterygians in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event and emphasises the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa.'
 'Smoking is a major cause of disease and death worldwide . DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA that can affect gene expression and has been linked to smoking. However, it is not clear whether DNA methylation is reactive to smoking or if it is a result of genetic predisposition. To address this question, researchers used data from a large study of monozygotic twins, who are genetically identical except for rare de novo mutations. They found that DNA methylation in blood cells is reactive to smoking, and that differences in smoking levels are reflected in DNA methylation patterns. They also found that DNA methylation patterns are reversible upon quitting smoking. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between smoking and DNA methylation, and may help identify new targets for smoking cessation interventions.'
 'The retina is a complex organ that processes visual information before it is sent to the brain. Researchers have studied the retina extensively using isolated, ex vivo preparations. However, these studies do not fully capture the behavior of the retina in awake animals. To address this, researchers recorded the activity of retinal ganglion cells in the optic tract of head-fixed mice. They found that awake retinal output had faster kinetics, a larger dynamic range, and higher firing activity than anesthetized or ex vivo retinal output. These results suggest that the retina may employ dense coding principles in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as has been often assumed from ex vivo studies.'
 'Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) is a common technique used in biology to preserve biomolecular interactions in vivo. However, a recent study has shown that PFA fixation can alter the appearance of liquid-liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) in living cells. The study found that fixation can either enhance or diminish the appearance of LLPS, depending on the protein being studied. In some cases, fixation can even cause droplet-like puncta to artificially appear in cells. The study used a combination of experiments, live-cell single-molecule imaging, and simulations to show that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and the difference between protein fixation rates in and out of droplet-like puncta. The study highlights the importance of considering the effects of fixation when interpreting results from fixed-cell imaging techniques and serves to guide future judicious application of PFA fixation.'
 'Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). These bacteria can form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) within bladder cells. IBCs are thought to play a role in the persistence of UTIs, but it is difficult to study them in situ. A new bladder-on-chip model has been developed that allows for the study of IBCs in a more realistic environment. Using this model, researchers found that IBCs can form within hours of infection and that they can survive antibiotic treatment. They also found that IBCs can reseed new infections when antibiotics are stopped or when the course of treatment is not completed. These findings suggest that IBCs play an important role in the persistence of UTIs and that strategies aimed at eradicating IBCs are important for effective treatment.'
 'Ammonium is a vital building block of life and is assimilated into cells through a network of enzymes. To study the flexibility of this network, researchers constructed an Escherichia coli glutamate auxotrophic strain and found that several amino acids could complement the auxotrophy by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. In this network, researchers identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, researchers extended the transamination network by the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources and identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Finally, researchers introduced ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine to further investigate the flexibility of the network. Their study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.'
 'Coral reefs are home to a diverse array of organisms, including symbiotic algae called dinoflagellates. These algae live inside the coral cells and provide them with energy through photosynthesis. However, it is not clear how the coral cells get the energy from the algae. In this study, researchers found that when the pH of the environment around the coral cells became more acidic, the algae released more glucose and galactose into the environment. This was likely due to the algae breaking down their cell walls in response to the acidic environment. The researchers also found that the algae released more glucose when their cellulase enzymes were activated. This suggests that the algae are using the acidic environment to break down their cell walls and release energy for the coral cells to use. Overall, this study provides important insights into how coral reefs can adapt to changing environmental conditions.'
 'Nephronophthisis ( NPHP ) is a rare genetic disorder that causes cysts and fibrosis in the kidneys. The protein INVS is one of the genes associated with NPHP. In mice, deleting INVS causes kidney cysts and fibrosis. To understand the role of INVS in kidney cells, researchers created two mouse models where INVS was deleted in either epithelial or stromal cells. They found that deleting INVS in epithelial cells caused kidney cysts and fibrosis, while deleting INVS in stromal cells did not cause any kidney problems. The researchers also found that removing cilia from kidney cells reduced the severity of the kidney problems caused by deleting INVS. Finally, the researchers found that treating mice with a drug called valproic acid ( VPA ) reduced kidney problems caused by deleting INVS. These findings suggest that INVS plays a role in kidney cells and that removing cilia or treating with VPA may help treat NPHP.'
 'The Steller's sea cow ( Hydrodamalis gigas; †1768 ) was a large marine mammal that lived in the North Pacific Ocean. It had special adaptations to survive in cold water, but its physiological adjustments are not well understood. Researchers have now studied the adult-expressed hemoglobin ( Hb ) of this extinct species and found that it has a fixed amino acid replacement at an otherwise invariant position. This change alters multiple aspects of Hb function, including its Hb-O2 affinity, temperature sensitivity, and response to allosteric effectors. The researchers also created a recombinant Hb protein with the β/δ82Lys→Asn exchange and found that it had reduced Hb-O2 affinity and increased solubility. These findings provide insights into the physiological adjustments that allowed the Steller's sea cow to survive in cold water.'
 'In this study, the authors developed a new method for generating continuous cell lines from primary Drosophila embryonic cultures using the Gal4-UAS system and the expression of activated Ras (RasV12). The authors found that this method was more efficient and reproducible than previous methods, and was able to generate cell lines from a variety of different tissue types. The authors also used this method to generate cell lines with specific cell types, such as glial, epithelial, and muscle cells, by using tissue-specific Gal4 drivers. The authors found that these cell lines were able to differentiate into their respective cell types when exposed to the hormone ecdysone. The authors suggest that this method could be used to generate a variety of different cell lines for high-throughput and biochemical studies. The authors also suggest that this method could be used to generate cell lines from other organisms, such as mice and humans.'
 'Multiciliated cells ( MCCs ) are specialized epithelial cells that line the surface of the respiratory tract, brain ventricles, and reproductive systems. These cells contain tens to hundreds of motile cilia that collectively beat to drive fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. To template these cilia, MCCs dramatically expand their centriole content during a process known as centriole amplification. In cycling cells, the master regulator of centriole assembly Polo-like kinase 4 ( PLK4 ) is essential for centriole duplication; however, recent work has questioned the role of PLK4 in centriole assembly in MCCs. To address this discrepancy, the authors created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Tracheal epithelial cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results show that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs and suggest that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events. The authors propose that PLK4 is a key regulator of centriole amplification and surface area expansion in MCCs, and that these processes are essential for proper MCC function.'
 'Endometrial repair is a remarkable process that occurs in response to menstruation, a monthly event in which the uterine lining is shed. The endometrium is a complex tissue that is composed of both epithelial and stromal cells. The stromal cells are responsible for providing support to the epithelial cells, while the epithelial cells form the lining of the uterus. During menstruation, the epithelial cells are shed, leaving the stromal cells exposed. The stromal cells then undergo a process called mesenchyme to epithelial transition (MET) to regenerate the epithelial layer. In this study, the authors used a mouse model of endometrial repair to investigate the role of stromal cells in this process. They used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify a population of stromal cells that were in a transitional state between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. They then used lineage tracing to track the fate of these cells during endometrial repair. The authors found that these stromal cells were able to undergo MET and become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of endometrial repair and highlights the potential for targeting stromal cells in the treatment of endometrial disorders.'
 'Bacteria often exist in complex communities where they must adapt to changing environmental conditions to survive. One way that bacteria can adapt is through a process called phase variation, which involves reversible genetic alterations that change the expression of specific phenotypes. In this study, the authors identified a phase variation system in the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis that generates a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous population. The system involves the duplication of a 208.6 kb region of DNA that contains 157 coding sequences. The authors showed that having two or more copies of the region is advantageous for growth in a biofilm, while having a single copy is advantageous during planktonic growth. They believe that this system represents a rare example of IS element-mediated evolution in which the IS elements provide homologous sequences for amplification of a chromosomal region that provides a selective advantage under specific growth conditions. This study highlights the importance of phase variation in allowing bacteria to adapt to changing environmental conditions and expand their lifestyle repertoire.'
 'In the early 1960s, the degeneracy of the genetic code was revealed in the context of multiple synonymous codons encoding a given amino acid. A large body of work since then has uncovered an astonishing degree of redundancy in the translation apparatus. The redundancy is often qualitative, whereby some components can functionally compensate for others. This includes the pool of tRNA molecules that read mRNA codons and deliver the appropriate amino acid during translation. tRNAs with different anticodons may read distinct synonymous codons but carry the same amino acid (tRNA isoacceptors) and are thus functionally degenerate. In addition, tRNA modifying enzymes (MEs) post-transcriptionally alter specific tRNAs (‘target’ tRNAs, i.e., targets of modification) allowing them to read codons that are otherwise decoded by ‘non-target’ tRNAs that are not modified by MEs (Grosjean, 2009). Hence, some non-target tRNAs could be redundant because their function can be carried out by target tRNAs after they get modified. For instance, in Escherichia coli the codon CCG can be decoded by the non-target tRNACGG (encoded by the gene proK) , but also by the target tRNAUGG (encoded by proM) after the U at position 34 is modified to cmo5U by the cmo modification pathway (in principle rendering the gene proK redundant). MEs are thus critical for maximizing cellular decoding capacity (Diwan and Agashe, 2018; Grosjean et al., 2010) and maintaining translational capability. However, in many cases, the predicted functional redundancy is not experimentally verified, and it remains unclear whether it influences fitness. We asked: what are the fitness costs and benefits of translational redundancy, and under what conditions do they manifest? Could these costs and benefits explain the evolution of a highly redundant translation apparatus? In bacteria, selection for rapid growth (often facilitated by nutrient availability) is thought to be an important force that shapes the evolution of many translation components. The maximum possible growth rate is determined by translation efficiency, which in turn depends on the concentrations of ribosomes and tRNAs (Ehrenberg and Kurland, 1984; Kurland and Ehrenberg, 1987; Kurland and Hughes, 1996). Across species, there are striking positive correlations between maximal growth rate and the number of tRNA and rRNA genes (Dethlefsen and Schmidt, 2007; Ikemura, 1985; Rocha, 2004; Roller et al., 2016). Thus, we expect that GCN redundancy in key translation components should be especially beneficial during rapid growth in a nutrient-rich niche. In contrast, under nutrient limitation, expressing redundant genes should be costly because translational output remains constrained by nutrients. However, this overarching growth rate-dependent selection may shape the redundancy of translation components differentially. For instance, selection should have the maximum impact on rRNA, whose GCN shows the strongest correlation with growth rate (Rocha, 2004; Roller et al., 2016). Ribosomal RNAs constitute up to 85% of all RNA in rapidly growing E. coli (Bremer and Dennis, 1996) and their concentration is most limiting for translation (Bremer and Dennis, 1996). In contrast, the growth rate-dependent impacts of redundancy in tRNA GCN remain largely unexplored, with the exception of initiator tRNA genes in E. coli. As predicted, in this case, the loss of some gene copies is deleterious in rich media and advantageous in poor media (Samhita et al., 2014). However, the growth rate-dependent impacts of elongator tRNA GCN are not known. The paucity of data for tRNA redundancy is glaring because bacteria show enormous variation in tRNA pools, driven by evolutionary changes in tRNA GCN as well as MEs (Ayan et al., 2020; Bedhomme et al., 2019; Diwan and Agashe, 2018; Wald and Margalit,
 'The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a massive amount of genomic data being collected on the virus, SARS-CoV-2. This data is typically represented as a phylogenetic tree, which captures the evolutionary history of the virus and allows researchers to identify transmission events and new variants. However, existing web-based tools for exploring these trees are not able to handle the scale of data now available. Taxonium is a new tool that uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser for the first time. Taxonium can be used to analyze a tree of five million sequences and provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The tool is available at cov2tree.org and taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium. The tool can be applied to any tree and is a valuable resource for researchers and the public to explore and understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.'
 'RNA molecules are localized to specific subcellular regions through interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) . In this study, the authors used a recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique, Halo-seq, to determine transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells. They found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins ( RP mRNAs ) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. Using reporter transcripts and single-molecule RNA FISH, they found that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5′ UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. In both cell types, the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the 5′ UTR of the transcript, was abolished upon perturbation of the RNA-binding protein LARP1, and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-1. To extend these findings, they compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells. They found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator, and demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms cut across cell morphologies.'
 'Aging is a complex process that affects many different cell types and tissues in the body. One of the hallmarks of aging is an increase in transcriptional noise, which refers to the variation in gene expression among cells that are supposed to be identical. However, the methods used to measure transcriptional noise have varied widely across studies, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. In this study, we used a Python toolkit called Decibel to implement four commonly used methods for measuring transcriptional noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. We also developed a new method called Scallop to measure the membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. We applied these methods to seven aging datasets from different tissues and species, and found that there was large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging. Instead, we found that age-associated changes in cell type composition were more consistent across datasets. Our results suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated, and that future studies should focus on understanding the underlying causes of age-associated changes in cell type composition.'
 'Intra-tumoural heterogeneity (ITH) is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment due to the presence of drug-resistant clonal lineages. However, identifying the characteristics of such lineages that underpin resistance to therapy has remained challenging. Here, we utilized clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq; Wholistic Interrogation of Lineage Dynamics by sequencing, in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to understand response and resistance to therapy, including BET bromodomain inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy. These analyses revealed oxidative stress protection by NRF2 as a major mechanism of taxane resistance and led to the discovery that our tumour models are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation therapy using the clinical stage drug L-asparaginase after frontline treatment with docetaxel. In summary, clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq identifies mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy that are also operative in patients and pinpoints asparagine bioavailability as a druggable vulnerability of taxane-resistant lineages.
 'DMRT1 is a gene that plays a crucial role in determining the sex of vertebrates. In mammals, where the sex-determining system is XX/XY, DMRT1 has been shown to have different functions in testis and ovarian development. In this study, the authors used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a DMRT1 mutant line in rabbits. They found that DMRT1 is required for testis differentiation and that it is also crucial for female fertility. The authors' findings suggest that DMRT1 is a testis-determining factor in mammals and that it plays an important role in both germ cells and supporting cells in the testis. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in mammals.'
 'Obesity is a complex disease that results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Drosophila has emerged as a useful model for studying obesity and its related diseases. CTPS is an important enzyme for the de novo synthesis of CTP, which governs the cellular level of CTP and the rate of phospholipid synthesis. CTPS forms filamentous structures called cytoophidia, which are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Our study found that CTPS is crucial in regulating body weight and starvation resistance in Drosophila by functioning in the fat body. HFD-induced obesity leads to increased transcription of CTPS and elongates cytoophidia in larval adipocytes. Depleting CTPS in the fat body prevented HFD-induced obesity, including body weight gain, adipocyte expansion, and lipid accumulation, by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis. These findings not only establish a functional link between CTPS and lipid homeostasis but also highlight the potential role of CTPS manipulation in the treatment of HFD-induced obesity.'
 'During embryogenesis, the germ layers are patterned by secreted Nodal signals. In the classical model, Nodals elicit signaling by binding to a complex comprising Type I/II Activin receptors (Acvr) and the co-receptor Tdgf1. However, it is currently unclear whether receptor binding can also affect the distribution of Nodals themselves through the embryo, and it is unknown which of the putative Acvr paralogs mediate Nodal signaling in zebrafish. Here, we characterize three Type I (Acvr1) and four Type II (Acvr2) homologs and show that – except for Acvr1c – all receptor-encoding transcripts are maternally deposited and present during zebrafish embryogenesis. We generated mutants and used them together with combinatorial morpholino knockdown and CRISPR F0 knockout (KO) approaches to assess compound loss-of-function phenotypes. We discovered that the Acvr2 homologs function partly redundantly and partly independently of Nodal to pattern the early zebrafish embryo, whereas the Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b redundantly act as major mediators of Nodal signaling. By combining quantitative analyses with expression manipulations, we found that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.'
 'Type I interferon ( IFN-I ) is a crucial component of the host defense against viral infections. The initiation of IFN-I production is limited to a small fraction of cells, both in vivo and in vitro, and is thought to be stochastically regulated. However, a new study challenges this dogma by showing that transient heritability and deterministic factors play a role in dictating early IFN-I responses. The study used a murine fibroblast reporter model and found that epigenetic drugs influenced the percentage of responding cells. The Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test provided evidence for transient heritability driving responder fates, which was verified with mathematical modeling. The study also found that cell density plays a role in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing. The findings of this study open up new avenues to progress the fundamental understanding of cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses, which can be translated to other ( immune ) signaling systems.'
α-tubulin is a protein that makes up microtubules, which are important for cell movement and division. In Drosophila, there are four different types of α-tubulin, and they can be modified in different ways. One of these modifications is glutamylation, which involves adding glutamic acid to the end of the protein. In this study, the authors found that one of the α-tubulin types, αTub84B/D, is glutamylated at the end of the protein, but another type, αTub67C, is not. They also found that a protein called TTLL5 is responsible for adding the glutamic acid to αTub84B/D. The authors then looked at what happens when TTLL5 is not working properly. They found that the microtubules in the ovaries of flies that do not have TTLL5 are not glutamylated, and this causes problems with the movement of proteins and organelles inside the cells. The authors also looked at what happens when TTLL5 is not working properly in the nervous system of flies. They found that the microtubules in the wing nerves of these flies are not glutamylated, and this causes problems with the movement of mitochondria inside the cells. Overall, the authors found that TTLL5 is important for the proper glutamylation of microtubules in both the ovaries and the nervous system of flies.
 'GENESPACE' is a new tool that helps researchers understand how genes have evolved over time. It does this by looking at the physical location of genes on different chromosomes and comparing them across multiple genomes. This helps researchers identify which genes are related to each other and which ones are not. The tool is particularly useful for studying the evolution of genes in complex genomes, such as those found in plants and animals. It can help researchers understand how genes have changed over time and how they are related to each other. This information can be used to better understand how different species have evolved and how they are related to each other. The tool is available for anyone to use and can be used to study the evolution of genes in many different species.
 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two common bacteria that often coexist in polymicrobial communities. These bacteria have a complex relationship, with P. aeruginosa reducing the growth and metabolism of S. aureus, and S. aureus increasing the virulence of P. aeruginosa. However, in vivo, both bacteria can coexist. The authors of this study used a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation to investigate how changes in the growth environment can influence the coexistence of these two bacteria. They found that changes in the carbon source in the growth medium affect the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric they call absolute growth. As a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture. This is due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. The authors also found that the relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. Their results demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature, provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations. This study has important implications for understanding the dynamics of polymicrobial communities and for developing new treatment strategies for bacterial infections.'
 'The amount of scientific data being published is growing rapidly, but there are few methods for capturing knowledge about phenotypes that result from interactions between diverse groups of species. To address this, a team of researchers has developed a framework for curating scientific literature on pathogen-host interactions. The framework includes a curation tool, a phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to capture changes in the disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility observed by gene alterations. The team has also created a community curation tool called PHI-Canto, which is available for use by publication authors. The framework and PHI-Canto are designed to improve access to knowledge about pathogen-host interactions and facilitate data-driven biology and research.'
 'In humans, genetic variants in enhancers are associated with many diseases, including cancer. However, it is difficult to predict the effect of these variants on enhancer function. In this study, researchers used F1-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice to identify thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. They found that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. They also observed that the AP-1 family of TFs (Fos/Jun) are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function, including sequences flanking core TF motifs and AP-1 half sites. These data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.'
 'Viruses interact with the intracellular transport machinery to promote viral replication. Such host–virus interactions can either benefit the host (e.g., immune recognition) or the virus (e.g., viral co-option of host machinery or viral antagonism of host immunity) and are critical determinants of the outcome of a viral infection. Competing genetic innovations on both sides of these host–virus conflicts result in signatures of recurrent adaptation that have been described as molecular ‘arms races’ (Daugherty and Malik, 2012; Duggal and Emerman, 2012; Tenthorey et al., 2022). Indeed, many host antiviral factors that directly interact with viral proteins display signatures of recurrent positive (diversifying) selection over evolutionary time, and genetic variation in these host–virus interactions shapes species-specific susceptibility to circulating and emerging pathogens (Daugherty and Malik, 2012; Duggal and Emerman, 2012; Tenthorey et al., 2022; Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011; Rothenburg and Brennan, 2020). These data suggest that there is great potential to use evolutionary signatures of rapid evolution not only as an approach to more deeply understand known host–virus conflicts but also as a means to discover new proteins engaged in viral interactions (Daugherty and Malik, 2012). Compellingly, it is estimated that around 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in humans result from viral selective pressure (Enard et al., 2016; Enard and Petrov, 2018), suggesting that many host–virus conflicts remain undescribed. One potential source of host–virus conflicts is over the active transport of macromolecules within the cell. The relatively large size of eukaryotic cells, coupled with the density of macromolecules in the cytoplasm, limits the effectiveness of diffusion to localize and transport large intracellular cargos, such as organelles, membrane vesicles, RNAs, and protein complexes (Luby-Phelps, 2000; Seksek et al., 1997). Eukaryotic cells overcome this problem by actively transporting large intracellular cargos using dynein and kinesin motors, which move on microtubules in opposite directions. Aspects of viral infection, viral replication, and the host immune response all require microtubule-based transport (Brandenburg and Zhuang, 2007; Dodding and Way, 2011; Döhner et al., 2005; Radtke et al., 2006). For example, viruses co-opt the microtubule cytoskeleton for cell entry, transport of viral components to sites of replication, remodeling of cellular compartments, and viral egress (Brandenburg and Zhuang, 2007; Dodding and Way, 2011; Döhner et al., 2005; Radtke et al., 2006). Similarly, in response to infection, the host adaptive and innate immune response require movement of signaling components, transport of endocytic and exocytic vesicles, organelle recycling, and cellular remodeling, all of which require the microtubule-based trafficking machinery (Ilan-Ber and Ilan, 2019; Kast and Dominguez, 2017; Man and Kanneganti, 2016; Mostowy and Shenoy, 2015). Despite the clear role of microtubule-based transport in both aiding and inhibiting viral replication, the degree to which host–virus genetic conflicts shape the basic biology of this machinery is poorly understood. To uncover the role of this machinery in viral replication and the immune response, we set out to determine whether there were undescribed genetic conflicts between viruses and the intracellular transport machinery. Specifically, we focused on the dynein transport machinery, which traffics dozens of cellular cargos towards microtubule minus-ends (generally anchored to centrosomes near the nucleus). In human cells, only one dynein motor-containing gene, cytoplasmic dynein-1 (DYNC
 'Actin is a highly conserved protein that is found in all eukaryotic cells and plays a crucial role in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Actin isoforms are expressed in different tissues and have distinct functions. In this study, the authors used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle α-actin, cardiac muscle α-actin, β-actin, and γ-actin in the Mg2+·ADP state with their native post-translational modifications. The structures revealed isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus that shift closer to the filament surface upon myosin binding, thereby establishing isoform-specific interfaces. The authors' findings provide a comprehensive understanding of in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms and complement the repertoire of known actin structures.'
 'Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences' (TARDIS) is a new approach to large-scale transgenesis in multicellular organisms. It overcomes the limitations of traditional transgenesis methods by separating the process into two steps: creation of individuals carrying experimentally introduced sequence libraries and inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components into engineered genomic sites. This allows for the creation of thousands of genetically unique transgenic individuals from a single individual. The TARDIS approach has been successfully demonstrated in Caenorhabditis elegans, where it has been used to generate unique animal barcodes and transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries. The system has the potential to be adapted for any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated.
 'The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in an asymmetric bilayer with embedded lipoproteins and transmembrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs). These proteins play vital functional roles, such as exchanging small molecules with the environment through their transmembrane β-barrel porins. The translocation and folding of OMPs involve many proteins, including essential and auxiliary ones that form multiple complexes in cooperation. Using AF2Complex, a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline, we identify protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and apply it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, we find not only expected interactions but also unexpected ones with profound implications. Subsequently, we predict atomic structures for these protein complexes. These structures, typically of high confidence, explain experimental observations and lead to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent, precursor OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to a β-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways by using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.'
 'Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are important for basal ganglia functions and play a role in motivation and cognition. These neurons have a complex axonal domain with a large subset of non-synaptic release sites and a smaller subset of synaptic terminals. The molecular mechanisms regulating the connectivity and neurotransmission of DA neurons are unknown. A growing body of work suggests that neuroligins (NLs), trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, regulate both DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission. Here, the authors tested the hypothesis that neurexins (Nrxns), another family of trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, regulate DA neuron neurotransmission. Mice with conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::NrxnsKO) exhibited normal basic motor functions but impaired locomotor response to amphetamine. Decreased levels of the membrane DA transporter (DAT) and increased levels of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) were detected in the striatum of DAT::NrxnsKO mice, along with reduced activity-dependent DA release. Electrophysiological recordings revealed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of these mice. Together, these findings suggest that Nrxns act as regulators of the functional connectivity of DA neurons.'
 'Mobile health ( mHealth ) interventions are being investigated throughout Africa to increase access to healthcare resources. However, individuals need to own a mobile phone to use mHealth interventions, and many proposed interventions require ownership of smartphones ( SPs ). In this study, the authors estimate the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 African countries, identify a relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic, and quantify inequities in ownership. They find that 82% of individuals in 33 countries own mobile phones, with 42% owning basic mobile phones and 40% owning smartphones. Individuals who live close to a health clinic have higher odds of ownership than those who do not. Men, urban residents, and younger individuals have higher odds of ownership. The authors also find that individuals under 30 are more likely to own an SP than a BP, while older individuals are more likely to own a BP than an SP. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for designing and implementing mHealth interventions in Africa. The study highlights the importance of considering the availability of mobile devices and the potential inequities in access to mHealth interventions when designing and implementing such interventions in Africa.'
 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) antibody levels can be used to assess humoral immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination , and may predict risk of future infection . Higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike antibodies are known to be associated with increased protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection . However , variation in antibody levels and risk factors for lower antibody levels following each round of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have not been explored across a wide range of socio-demographic , SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination , and health factors within population-based cohorts . Samples were collected from 9361 individuals from TwinsUK and ALSPAC UK population-based longitudinal studies and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies . Cross-sectional sampling was undertaken jointly in April-May 2021 ( TwinsUK , N=4256; ALSPAC , N=4622 ) , and in TwinsUK only in November 2021-January 2022 ( N=3575 ) . Variation in antibody levels after first , second , and third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with health , socio-demographic , SARS-CoV-2 infection , and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination variables were analysed . Using multivariable logistic regression models , we tested associations between antibody levels following vaccination and: ( 1 ) SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination ( s ) ; ( 2 ) health , socio-demographic , SARS-CoV-2 infection , and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination variables . Within TwinsUK , single-vaccinated individuals with the lowest 20% of anti-Spike antibody levels at initial testing had threefold greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next 6–9 months ( OR = 2 . 9 , 95% CI: 1 . 4 , 6 . 0 ) , compared to the top 20% . In TwinsUK and ALSPAC , individuals identified as at increased risk of COVID-19 complication through the UK ‘Shielded Patient List’ had consistently greater odds ( two- to fourfold ) of having antibody levels in the lowest 10% . Third vaccination increased absolute antibody levels for almost all individuals , and reduced relative disparities compared with earlier vaccinations . These findings quantify the association between antibody level and risk of subsequent infection , and support a policy of triple vaccination for the generation of protective antibodies . Antibody testing was funded by UK Health Security Agency .
