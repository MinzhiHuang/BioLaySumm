 'Neural networks are responsible for complex computations that support cognition. The development of these networks is not well understood, but it is known that immature neural networks exhibit spindle-like oscillations that are triggered by peripheral stimuli. These oscillations are thought to be important for the development of sensory ensembles and critical period plasticity. As the brain matures, these oscillations disappear and are replaced by more complex patterns of neural activity. In this study, researchers used high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology to investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development in immature mice. They found that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. The researchers also found a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. They hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.'
 'Many decisions are thought to arise via the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. In perception, the mechanism explains the effect of stimulus strength, characterized by signal-to-noise ratio, on decision speed, accuracy, and confidence. An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and, paradoxically, higher confidence. To test these predictions, the authors introduce a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex, which they verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. For both humans and monkeys, increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model. The findings suggest that the addition of noise to sensory information can lead to faster decisions and greater confidence, even when accuracy is not impaired.'
 'OCRL is a protein that helps cells communicate with each other and with their environment. It is involved in a process called endocytosis, which is how cells take in materials from their environment. Mutations in OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease, which are genetic disorders that affect the brain, eyes, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Researchers have found that OCRL is important for endocytosis and that it helps cells take in materials from their environment. They also found that OCRL helps cells communicate with each other and with their environment. This research could help doctors better understand and treat Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.'
 'Gradients of signaling proteins are essential for tissue morphogenesis, but the mechanisms of gradient formation are not well understood. In this study, researchers used live imaging to track the movement of a signaling protein called FGF from its source to its target cells in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. They found that FGF moved through specialized filopodia called cytonemes, which extended from the target cells to the source. The number of cytonemes decreased with increasing distance from the source, creating a recipient-specific gradient. The researchers also found that the gradient was self-regulated by feedback between the source and target cells. These findings provide new insights into how signaling proteins form gradients and regulate tissue morphogenesis.
 'The genetic makeup of a person is a result of the combination of genetic material from their parents. By studying the genetic makeup of many people, researchers can learn about the history of human populations and how they have changed over time. In this study, researchers used a detailed analysis of genetic variation to understand the history of sub-Saharan African populations. They found that many sub-Saharan African populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. They also found evidence of recent Eurasian admixture in many sub-Saharan African populations. This study provides an important description of the movement of alleles and haplotypes into and within the continent, and helps to understand the genetic basis of important diseases in Africa.'
 'Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a common human virus that can cause various types of cancer. EBV expresses viral oncoproteins that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis, the programmed cell death that occurs when cells are damaged beyond repair. The viral oncoprotein LMP1 is critical for the survival of EBV-immortalized B cells, which are cells that can proliferate indefinitely in culture. However, during early infection, B cells rapidly proliferate with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. In this study, the authors used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells ( BCL-2 ) to early-infected ( MCL-1/BCL-2 ) and immortalized cells ( BFL-1 ). This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.'
 'Transcription is a complex process that involves many different steps and proteins. One of the key proteins involved in transcription is RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which reads the DNA code and makes a copy of it into RNA. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII is a long, disordered region that is important for many different steps in the transcription process. In this study, the authors found that the CTD of RNAPII can be modified in several different ways, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation. They also found that these modifications occur at different stages of the transcription process and that they are important for regulating gene expression. The authors used a combination of biochemical and genetic techniques to study these modifications and their effects on gene expression. They found that the balance between different modifications is important for regulating gene expression and that this balance can be disrupted in diseases such as cancer. Overall, this study provides important insights into the complex process of transcription and how it is regulated by different modifications to RNAPII. '
 'Swi2/Snf2 ATPases are a large and diverse class of proteins that remodel DNA-associated processes. However, detailed structural information on the ATP-dependent remodeling reactions is largely absent. The single subunit remodeler Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.'
 'Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. During meiosis, chromosomes are segregated in a precise and coordinated manner to ensure that each gamete receives the correct number of chromosomes. This process involves multiple regulatory mechanisms that ensure that chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules and that cohesion between sister chromatids is maintained until the correct number of chromosomes are attached to microtubules. A recent study has identified a protein called Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) that plays a key role in coordinating these processes. Sgol2 interacts with multiple proteins involved in meiosis, including PP2A, Mad2, Aurora B/C kinases, and MCAK. These interactions allow Sgol2 to regulate the spindle assembly checkpoint, error correction, and K-fiber formation. The study also found that Sgol2 is required for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis I. Overall, the findings of this study provide important insights into the mechanisms that regulate meiosis and the role of Sgol2 in coordinating these processes.'
 'Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here, we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other significant locus effects (7%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance. The average nasopharyngeal duration period is affected by a large number of factors, which may themselves interact. One factor that is known to strongly associate with carriage duration is serotype: as capsular polysaccharides are important in bacterial physiology and determining host immune response, different serotypes have different clearance and acquisition rates. Additionally, a range of other proteins have been identified as critical to the colonisation process, some of which exhibit similar levels of diversity to the capsule polysaccharide synthesis locus. However, the overall and relative contributions of these sequence variations to carriage duration have not yet been characterised. In addition, variation of pathogen protein sequence, accessory genes, and interaction effects between genetic elements may also have as yet unknown effects on carriage duration. Changes in average carriage duration have been shown to be linked with recombination rate, which has been found to correlate with antibiotic resistance and invasive potential. The carriage duration by different serotypes is widely used in models of pneumococcal epidemiology, and consequently is important in evaluating the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Additionally, modelling work has proposed that if alleles exist which alter carriage duration, these explain the long-standing puzzle of how antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains stably coexist in the population. Measurement of carriage duration and the analysis of its variance beyond the resolution of serotype will have important consequences for these models.'
 'C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has evolved independently in at least 60 plant lineages . The evolutionary paths leading to C4 photosynthesis are diverse and flexible, with four major trajectories that group together based on shared phenotypic alterations . These evolutionary paths are not driven by photosynthetic factors alone, but rather by non-photosynthetic factors . This flexibility in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis may have facilitated its convergent evolution in multiple lineages . The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the evolution of complex traits and for engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species.'
 Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To ensure efficient translation of its own RNA, IAV employs a variety of strategies to shut down host gene expression. In this study, the authors used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms of host shutoff during IAV infection. They found that IAV reduces host mRNA levels, but does not preferentially translate its own RNA. The authors also noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins are less affected by IAV infection, and their continuous expression supports the energetic demands of the virus. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of host shutoff during IAV infection and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
 'The circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus controls the timing of gene expression and metabolism to maximize fitness in response to changes in the environment. The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription in cyanobacteria, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpaA renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. The rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions. These observations highlight how a circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations.'
α-Helical coiled coils are a common protein fold found in a wide range of structural and functional contexts. They are made up of two or more α-helices wound into a superhelical bundle and held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. The backbone structure of coiled coils can be described by parametric equations, making them the best-understood protein fold. However, a new type of fiber has been discovered by inserting two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands that move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil that retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. The authors found that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.
 'Hemoglobin ( Hb ) is a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The way Hb carries oxygen is controlled by its oxygen affinity and cooperativity. These properties have been thought to be determined by the affinity of Hb for oxygen. However, a new study suggests that Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptions that optimized tissue oxygen delivery. The study used a mathematical model to map the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model. The study found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. The study reveals the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. The generality and implications of the findings are discussed.'
 'Insects have evolved many unique and complex structures to solve problems in their environment. One such structure is the switching valve found in the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. This valve allows females to compete for seminal gifts from males by coercively anchoring them during copulation and consuming the semen as a source of nutrition. The valve is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. The valve has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla to continue mating while the first slot is occupied. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. This study provides insight into the functional morphology of the spermathecal plate, which plays an important role in the evolution of the female penis in Neotrogla.'
 'Scientists have been studying how AMPA receptors ( AMPARs ) move in and out of synapses for a long time. They have found that AMPARs are located both inside and outside of synapses, and that they move quickly. However, it is not clear how AMPARs move into and out of synapses. To study this, scientists used a technique called super-resolution microscopy to look at how different-sized fluorescent probes labeled to AMPARs moved in and out of synapses. They found that most AMPARs labeled with small fluorescent probes were located inside synapses, and that they moved slowly. However, when AMPARs were labeled with larger fluorescent probes, most of them were located outside of synapses, and they moved quickly. This suggests that AMPARs move quickly into synapses, but then become trapped inside. This study provides new information about how AMPARs move in and out of synapses, which could help scientists understand how synapses work and how they change during learning and memory.'
 'Histone acetylation and H2A . Z variant are important for active transcription. In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A . V (the fly ortholog of H2A . Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene.'
 'Membrane nanodomains have been implicated in Ras signaling, but what these domains are and how they interact with Ras remain obscure. Using single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) and detailed trajectory analysis, researchers have now shown that distinct membrane domains dictate KRasG12D (an active KRas mutant) diffusion and trafficking in U2OS cells. KRasG12D exhibits an immobile state in ~70 nm domains, each embedded in a larger domain (~200 nm) that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. Moreover, KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, both the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels. The results reveal how membrane organization dictates membrane diffusion and trafficking of Ras and offer new insight into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling.'
 'This is a scientific analysis of the effects of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells. The author was prompted by a series of recent reports that claimed to have identified a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals, as well as magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field. The author argues that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, with discrepancies ranging from 5 to 10 log units. If the reported phenomena do in fact occur, they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The author's goal is to offer some calculations as a supplement to those articles, which should help in evaluating future hypotheses and in engineering new molecular tools.'
 'Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing. To investigate the neural basis for this strategy, we used functional MRI to examine the connectivity between language-related regions and pitch-related regions in individuals with amusia and controls. We found that the amusia group had prominent reductions in functional connectivity between these regions, which reflected their between-group differences in cue weights. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism.'
 'NCOA4 is a protein that helps the body control the amount of iron in cells. Iron is important for many processes in the body, including oxygen storage and energy production. NCOA4 helps to break down ferritin, a protein that stores iron, when there is too much iron in cells. This process is called ferritinophagy. Researchers have found that NCOA4 interacts with a protein called FTH1, which is part of ferritin, to help break down ferritin. They also found that NCOA4 is controlled by the protein HERC2, which helps to break down NCOA4 when there is too much iron in cells. The researchers used zebrafish and cells in a lab to study how NCOA4 works. They found that NCOA4 is important for making red blood cells, which need iron to work properly. This study helps us understand how the body controls the amount of iron in cells and how this is important for making red blood cells.'
 'Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause enteric infections and meningitis. To be fully virulent, Listeria must evade macrophage killing, enter and replicate in epithelial cells, and spread from cell to cell. Listeria also activates the innate immune response, including the interferon-stimulated ubl ISG15. In this study, the authors show that ISG15 expression is dramatically induced upon Listeria infection in nonphagocytic cells, and that this induction can be type I interferon independent. They also show that ISG15 restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. The authors used stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC) to identify ISGylated proteins, which were enriched in integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This enrichment correlated with an increase in canonical secretion of cytokines known to control infection. The authors conclude that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response to Listeria infection, and that ISGylation of ER and Golgi proteins may be a mechanism by which ISG15 restricts Listeria infection.'
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in an odor gradient field. In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, flies were subjected to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs) were examined. The study found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs, PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.
