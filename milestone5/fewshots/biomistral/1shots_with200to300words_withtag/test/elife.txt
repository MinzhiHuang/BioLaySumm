In this study, the authors used computational methods to model the structure of a protein called OafB, which is involved in the O-acetylation of the LPS in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. OafB is an AT3-SGNH protein, which means it has an AT3 domain and an SGNH domain. The authors used RaptorX to predict the structure of the AT3 domain, and then used molecular dynamics simulations to refine the structure. They also used quantum mechanical calculations to model the interactions between the acetyl donor and acceptor substrates. The authors found that the acetyl group is transferred from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane to the periplasmic side, where it is transferred to the LPS. They also found that the SGNH domain is likely to be flexible and may interact with the AT3 domain. The authors conclude that their model provides a better understanding of the mechanism of O-acetylation in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium.
'Honey bees are known for their ability to make quick and accurate decisions about which flowers to visit for nectar and pollen. To understand how they make these decisions, researchers used a controlled flight arena to study their speed and accuracy of both flower acceptance and rejection decisions. They found that honey bees are capable of making sophisticated decisions that are sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence. Their decisions were also influenced by the context, such as the presence of predators or the state of the colony. To model the decision-making process of honey bees, researchers developed a simple model that can be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain. Their model proposes a system for robust autonomous decision-making that could be applied in robotics.'
 'Metformin is a widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes that has been shown to extend lifespan in various organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are not fully understood. In this study, the authors used unbiased screening in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genes necessary for metformin-mediated lifespan extension. They found that genes involved in ether lipid biosynthesis are required for metformin-mediated lifespan extension. The authors also found that overexpression of a single enzyme involved in ether lipid biosynthesis is sufficient to extend lifespan. These findings suggest that ether lipids play a key role in metformin-mediated lifespan extension and may be a potential therapeutic target for healthy aging.'
 'The gut microbiome is a complex community of microorganisms that plays a crucial role in human health. However, the relationships between different microbes in the gut are not well understood. In this study, the authors used a robust modeling framework to analyze the correlations between different microbes in the gut of baboons over a 13-year period. They found that most microbial correlations were weak and negative, and that these correlations were generally consistent across hosts. The authors also found that taxa that were closely related phylogenetically tended to have positive correlations. These findings suggest that the gut microbiome is structured in a way that promotes stability and resilience, and that personalized microbiomes may not be as common as previously thought. The authors' modeling approach could be used to better understand the relationships between microbes in other environments, such as soil or the ocean.'
'Gamma oscillations are thought to be important for cognitive processes such as sensory processing, memory, navigation, and conscious awareness. These oscillations are generated by the synchronization of neurons in the brain and are believed to shape the formation of transient neuronal partnerships, or cell assemblies. However, gamma oscillations are not a monolithic entity and can be nested within slower rhythms. In particular, gamma oscillations have been found to be coupled to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas. In this study, researchers investigated the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform (olfactory) cortex of awake mice. They found that respiration drives gamma oscillations in this region, which derive from feedback inhibition and depend on recurrent connections between local excitatory and feedback inhibitory populations. This loop is triggered by the projection of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb onto the principal cells of the piriform cortex. As functional consequences, the researchers show that respiration-driven gamma oscillations determine odor-assembly representations through a winner-take-all computation taking place within breathing cycles. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of gamma oscillations and their role in cognitive processes.'
 'Replication of DNA in eukaryotic cells occurs in a highly coordinated manner, with different regions of the genome replicating at different times during the cell cycle. This spatiotemporal replication program is important for maintaining genome stability and proper gene expression. However, the mechanisms that establish this program are not well understood. In a recent study, the authors used a novel method called MERCI to isolate a stable complex of two proteins, SUUR and Mod, that are involved in establishing late replication of certain regions of the genome. They found that SUUR and Mod work together to establish insulator boundaries, which are regions of the genome that prevent certain enhancer-promoter interactions and establish boundaries between euchromatin (active regions of the genome) and heterochromatin (silent regions of the genome). The authors also found that mutations in SUUR or Mod reverse underreplication of certain regions of the genome, suggesting that these proteins are important for establishing late replication. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms that establish spatiotemporal replication programs in eukaryotic cells.'
 'Biological age' is a concept that has been widely studied in adults, but its interpretation in children remains unclear. In this study, the authors aimed to clarify the relationship between biological age and child developmental outcomes, including growth and adiposity, cognition, behavior, lung function, and the onset of puberty, among European school-age children participating in the HELIX exposome cohort. The study population included up to 1173 children, aged between 5 and 12 years, from study centres in the UK, France, Spain, Norway, Lithuania, and Greece. Telomere length, DNA methylation age, and gene expression were measured using various assays. DNA methylation age was assessed using Horvath’s skin and blood clock, while novel blood transcriptome and ‘immunometabolic’ (based on plasma proteins and urinary and serum metabolites) clocks were derived and tested in a subset of children assessed six months after the main follow-up visit. Associations between biological age indicators with child developmental measures as well as health risk factors were estimated using linear regression, adjusted for chronological age, sex, ethnicity, and study centre. The clock derived markers were expressed as Δ age (i.e., predicted minus chronological age). Transcriptome and immunometabolic clocks predicted chronological age well in the test set (r=0.93 and r=0.84 respectively). Generally, weak correlations were observed between the biological age markers and child developmental measures, after adjustment for chronological age. Immunometabolic Δ age was associated with better working memory (p=4e–3) and reduced inattentiveness (p=4e–4), while DNA methylation Δ age was associated with greater inattentiveness (p=0.03) and poorer externalizing behaviors (p=0.01). Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors (p=0.03). In children, as in adults, biological aging appears to be a multi-faceted process and adiposity is an important correlate of accelerated biological aging. Patterns of associations suggested that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging, apparent even in children.

 'Asthma is a complex disorder with multiple clinical phenotypes . In this study, the authors conducted a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of wheezing phenotypes jointly derived using unbiased analysis of data collected from birth to 18 years in 9568 individuals from five UK birth cohorts . They identified 44 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with early-onset persistent, 25 with pre-school remitting, 33 with mid-childhood remitting, and 32 with late-onset wheeze. They also identified a novel locus on chr9q21.13 associated exclusively with early-onset persistent wheeze. The authors then used Promoter Capture Hi-C loops to identify the most likely causative SNP, rs75260654, which confers a reduction in annexin 1 (ANXA1) expression. Finally, in a murine model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway disease, they demonstrated that anxa1 protein expression increased and anxa1 mRNA was significantly induced in lung tissue following HDM exposure. Using anxa1-/- deficient mice, they showed that loss of anxa1 results in heightened airway hyperreactivity and Th2 inflammation upon allergen challenge. The authors conclude that targeting this pathway in persistent disease may represent an exciting therapeutic prospect.'
 'Intercropping is a method of growing multiple crops in the same field, which can increase agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, the effectiveness of intercropping depends on the interactions between the different crops. These interactions can be positive or negative, and they can change over time. In this study, the authors investigated how the interactions between six different crop species changed over three generations of intercropping. They found that the interactions between the crops became more positive, or facilitative, over time. This was particularly true in conditions of reduced soil fertility. The authors suggest that this change in interactions may be due to the evolution of the crops over time. They also found that the evolution of the crops led to changes in their traits, such as their height and leaf dry matter content. These changes in traits may be related to the change in interactions between the crops. The authors conclude that their findings have important implications for diversified agriculture, as they suggest that targeted breeding of crops for intercropping could increase the effectiveness of this method. However, they also note that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these changes in interactions and traits.'
 'The majority of primate species live in complex social groups, in which interactions range from intense competition to cooperation. To adjust behavior optimally, individuals need to assess their own actions and goals, and those of other group members, while taking into account the history of interactions with and between these individuals. Game theory offers a powerful framework to investigate dyadic social interactions and the evolution of coordination. In 2×2 games, each of the two agents chooses one of two actions, and the outcome depends on the combination of their choices. Non-zero-sum 2×2 games that have both cooperative and competitive elements with aligned and opposing interests are particularly interesting for understanding many realistic scenarios. In the Stag Hunt game, agents choose between maximizing the individual as well as joint reward and minimizing the individual risk. Humans often show a bias towards cooperative behavior. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, agents maximize their joint reward if they both choose to cooperate. Yet, an individual agent obtains the highest reward when defecting while the partner cooperates, creating a dilemma between the selfish temptation to defect and a riskier cooperation that requires trust. In the Conflict game, agents maximize their individual reward when they both choose to defect. However, an actual clash is highly detrimental to both. Humans often alternate between the two individually-optimal anti-coordinated choices, called cooperative turn-taking. In the BoS game, each agent has an individually preferred option, but coordinating on either one of these options adds the same bonus to both agents. This renders any coordinated choice better than no coordination for both agents, but one coordinated choice is better for the first agent and the other better for the second agent. Humans often take turns, switching between the two coordinated options to ensure fairness. In a transparent version of the BoS game, we compared human and macaque pairs in their ability to coordinate and their use of action visibility. We found that both humans and macaques used action visibility to adjust their choices and coordinate their actions. However, humans engaged in pro-social turn-taking, while macaques coordinated to increase individual (and joint) rewards without turn-taking. Our results illustrate how action visibility promotes the emergence and maintenance of coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions. Overall, our results suggest that the dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans but can occur on the background of different social attitudes and cognitive capacities in rhesus monkeys.'
 'Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells ( hPGCLCs ) from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) , a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors ( TFs ) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, our cells form ovary-like organoids ( ovaroids ) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.'
 'The genetic basis of skin color variation between populations has been a long-standing puzzle. In this study, the authors sought to find a Native American population with genetic African admixture but low frequency of European light skin alleles. They analyzed 458 genomes from individuals residing in the Kalinago Territory of the Commonwealth of Dominica and found that the population had approximately 55% Native American, 32% African, and 12% European genetic ancestry. Skin pigmentation ranged from 20 to 80 melanin units, averaging 46. Three albino individuals were determined to be homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV contained within a haplotype of African origin. The authors identified the new albinism allele in that population and measured the hypopigmenting effects of the responsible albinism allele, the European SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374 alleles. Native American genetic ancestry alone caused a measurable effect on pigmentation. In contrast, alleles identified in past studies of Native American skin color caused no significant effect on skin color. The authors suggest that the genetic basis for lighter skin pigmentation specific to Native American and East Asian populations remains to be found.'
 'Exercise and antioxidants are two common treatments for diabetes. However, the exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains unclear. In this study, the authors compared exercise and antioxidant intervention on type 2 diabetic rats and found that moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver. In contrast, antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both of these two interventions could promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMPK signaling; therefore, ameliorating diabetes. During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation. However, excessive exercise increased oxidative damage and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK. Overall, the authors' results illustrate that both exercise and antioxidant intervention improve blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox state. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.'
 'The escape trajectory (ET) of prey is a crucial factor in avoiding predation. Previous geometric models have predicted a single optimal ET, but many species show highly variable ETs. In this study, a new geometric model was constructed that incorporates the time required for prey to turn and the predator's position at the end of its attack. The optimal ET was determined by maximizing the time difference of arrival at the edge of the safety zone between the prey and predator. By fitting the model to experimental data of fish Pagrus major, the authors show that the model can clearly explain the observed multiple preferred ETs. By changing the parameters of the same model within a realistic range, the authors were able to produce various patterns of ETs empirically observed in other species. The results open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.'
'Recent advances in gene editing technology have made it possible to precisely modify the DNA of human stem cells to create disease models. However, these methods can be inefficient and often result in unwanted mutations. A new approach called prime editing (PE) has shown promise in other cell types, but its efficiency in human stem cells has not been well-established. In this study, the authors compared the efficiency of PE to conventional gene editing methods in human stem cells and found that PE is overall more efficient and precise. They also optimized the delivery of the PE components to improve efficiency, achieving editing efficiencies exceeding 60%. These findings suggest that PE has the potential to become a preferred method for genome editing in human stem cells, allowing for the creation of more accurate disease models.'
 'Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell. The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is used to classify MM patients into three stages, with stage III having the worst prognosis. In this study, the authors used single-cell transcriptome sequencing to compare the gene expression patterns of different stages of MM. They found that a novel cytotoxic plasma cell population was enriched in stage II patients, and a malignant plasma cell population with elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA was associated with unfavorable prognosis and EBV infection. The authors also identified potential immunotargets such as SIRPA-CD47 and CD74-MIF. These findings provide a single-cell MM atlas and reveal the clinical significance of novel plasma cell clusters, as well as potential immunotargets in MM progression.'
'The CRISPR-Cas system is a powerful tool for genome editing and has been used to treat genetic diseases. However, the system is not without its limitations. One of the main challenges is the difficulty of targeting specific regions of the genome. Researchers have now developed a new type of CRISPR-Cas system called Cas7-11 that can overcome this challenge. Cas7-11 is a single-subunit enzyme that uses a single RNA molecule to target and cleave specific regions of DNA. The researchers have now determined the structure of Cas7-11 using cryo-electron microscopy. This structure reveals the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. The researchers have also demonstrated that Cas7-11 can be used to target specific regions of the genome in mammalian cells. This new system has the potential to revolutionize the field of genome editing and could be used to treat genetic diseases. '
'Addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity . While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity , our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited . Here , we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity on tree productivity , and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks . We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity , reduced soil fungal diversity , and marginally reduced herbivory . The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested . Given the complexity of interactions between species and genetic diversity , tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity , we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation .'
'Single-molecule imaging is a powerful tool for studying biochemical processes in live cells, but it remains challenging to track single molecules while simultaneously detecting their interactions. In this study, the authors describe a novel property of rhodamine dyes, proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), in which one fluorophore (the ‘sender’) can reactivate a second fluorophore (the ‘receiver’) from a dark state. PAPA requires proximity between the two fluorophores, yet it operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The authors show that PAPA can be used in live cells to detect protein–protein interactions and to highlight a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. In proof-of-concept experiments, PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. These results establish a new way in which a photophysical property of fluorophores can be harnessed to study molecular interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells.'
'Calcium is an important nutrient for bone health, and many people take calcium supplements to improve their bone density. However, it is not clear if calcium supplements are effective in young people. To find out, a group of researchers did a comprehensive review of all the studies that looked at the effects of calcium supplements on bone density in young people. They found that calcium supplements were associated with an increase in bone density in the femoral neck, total body, and lumbar spine. However, there was no effect on total hip bone density or bone mineral content. The researchers also found that the effect of calcium supplements on bone density was more pronounced in young people who were in the process of achieving their peak bone mass than in those who had already achieved it. This suggests that calcium supplements may be most effective when taken before or around the time when young people reach their peak bone mass. The researchers concluded that their findings provide evidence that calcium supplements can improve bone density in young people, and that preventive calcium supplementation before or around the time of achieving peak bone mass may be a shift in the window of intervention for osteoporosis.'
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly contagious virus that causes respiratory illness in humans and animals. IAV replicates by forming liquid cytosolic condensates called viral inclusions, which contain the viral genome and are thought to be important for viral replication. In this study, researchers used computational modeling to investigate how the material properties of IAV inclusions are regulated. They found that the hardening of IAV inclusions can be achieved by targeting the interactions between the viral genome and the host protein Rab11, which are important for the formation of IAV inclusions. The researchers also found that the hardening of IAV inclusions can be achieved without affecting the abundance or solubility of host proteins. This study provides important insights into how the material properties of IAV inclusions can be regulated and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.'
 'Kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors that drive the movement of various cargos along microtubules. Kinesin-4 is a unique member of the kinesin superfamily that inhibits microtubule dynamics. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with curved tubulin dimers revealed the molecular mechanism of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4. KLP-12 precisely controls the curvature of tubulin dimers at the plus-end, which is larger than that decorated by plus-end stabilizing kinesin-1 and smaller than that decorated by destabilizing kinesin-13. This precise control is achieved by specific interactions on the microtubule interfaces conserved among kinesin-4 motors. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4 and its role in regulating axonal length.'
 'The human brain is incredibly complex and powerful, allowing us to think, feel, and act. However, we still have a lot to learn about how it works. One way to study the brain is by looking at the cells that make it up. These cells are called neurons, and they come in many different types. Some neurons are responsible for sensing information from the outside world, like light or sound. Others are responsible for processing that information and sending it to other parts of the brain. Still others are responsible for sending that information back out into the world, like when we move our arms or legs. By understanding the different types of neurons and how they work together, we can better understand how the brain processes information and how it controls our bodies. In this study, researchers used a special type of mouse to study a specific type of neuron in the brain. They found that these neurons were important for controlling how the brain processes information, and that they worked together with other types of neurons to do this. By learning more about these neurons and how they work, the researchers hope to better understand how the brain processes information and how it controls our bodies. This could help us to better understand and treat brain disorders like Alzheimer’s disease or autism. It could also help us to develop new ways to improve our own brains, like by learning how to better control our thoughts and actions.'
 'The circadian clock is a biological clock that regulates daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In plants, the circadian clock controls the timing of anthesis, or the opening of flowers, in domesticated sunflowers. Sunflowers have hundreds or even thousands of florets on a single capitulum, which is a disk-shaped structure that develops over time. During early development, florets are arranged in a spiral pattern on the capitulum. However, as development progresses, florets undergo anthesis in discrete rings, or pseudowhorls, on successive days. The authors found that daily rhythms in development and the formation of pseudowhorls are lost in constant light, and that the effects of light on floret development are time-of-day-dependent. They also found that the timing of anthesis affects visits by pollinating insects, linking circadian control of floral maturation with plant reproductive success. The authors propose that pseudowhorls are produced in response to an external coincidence mechanism, in which developmentally competent florets undergo reproductive transitions only when they receive environmental cues at the appropriate time of day. Their findings suggest a role for the circadian clock in the spatial as well as temporal control of sunflower development.'
'Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive chemical that can cause damage to the macromolecules required for life. Organisms have defense mechanisms to protect themselves from this damage, but these defenses are not always effective. In this study, researchers found that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans uses temperature information perceived by sensory neurons to cope with the temperature-dependent threat of hydrogen peroxide produced by the pathogenic bacterium Enterococcus faecium. These nematodes preemptively induce the expression of specific hydrogen peroxide defenses in response to perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons. These neurons communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical. The researchers conclude that organisms can use temperature information to adjust their defenses to better cope with the threat of hydrogen peroxide.'
'Class switch recombination (CSR) is a process that allows antibodies to change their class, or type, in response to different pathogens. This process is essential for a robust immune system, but defects can lead to autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis. Transcription is required during CSR to recruit the cytidine deaminase AID, which is essential for the formation of DNA double-strand breaks. However, the impact of R loops on double-strand break formation and repair during CSR remains unclear. In this study, researchers used mouse knockout models to investigate the role of two enzymes involved in R loop removal, senataxin and RNase H2, in CSR. They found that loss of both enzymes led to increased R loops specifically at the Sμ switch region in resting or activated B cells, which correlated with enhanced genome instability at the heavy-chain locus. The researchers also observed increased mutations and insertion events in SETX- and RNase H2-deficient B cells by molecular analysis of switch junctions. These findings suggest that timely R loop removal at switch regions by a SETX/RNase H2 mechanism during CSR suppresses error-prone end-joining and translocation formation at IgH. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying CSR and may lead to the development of new therapies for autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis.'
 'The COVID-19 pandemic has been caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has mutated into several variants that are more contagious and resistant to vaccines. The Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, has become the dominant strain worldwide. The Omicron variant has 15 mutations in the spike protein, which is the target of neutralizing antibodies. These mutations make it difficult for the body to recognize and fight the virus. Researchers have developed a new vaccine candidate, called mos-tri-RBD, which contains the key mutations from the Omicron variant. The vaccine was tested in rats and found to be highly immunogenic, meaning it can stimulate a strong immune response. The vaccine was also found to be more effective than the current vaccines in neutralizing the Omicron variant. The vaccine was tested as a booster shot after the primary series of vaccination and was found to be more effective than the current vaccines in boosting the immune response. The results of this study suggest that the mos-tri-RBD vaccine could be a promising candidate for combating the Omicron variant and future variants of the virus. The vaccine could also be used as a booster shot to improve the effectiveness of current vaccines. Further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in humans.'
 'Malaria is a deadly disease caused by parasites that infect red blood cells and digest hemoglobin to get the amino acids they need to grow. One of the enzymes that helps the parasites do this is called PfA-M17. In this study, the authors used genetic and chemical methods to show that PfA-M17 is essential for the growth of the parasites. They also found that PfA-M17 helps the parasites digest hemoglobin in a way that is different from other enzymes that help with this process. The authors suggest that PfA-M17 could be a target for new drugs to treat malaria.'
 'This study used single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to characterize an enriched population of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals . Based on their transcriptional profile , the authors identified changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging , and differences in their functionality, as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis . Trajectory inference revealed that altered gene expression dynamics accompanied cell differentiation , which could explain aging-associated changes in hematopoiesis . Next, the authors focused on key regulators of transcription by constructing gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) and detected regulons that were specifically active in elderly individuals . Using previous findings in healthy cells as a reference , the authors analyzed scRNA-seq data obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) and detected specific alterations of the expression dynamics of genes involved in erythroid differentiation in all patients with MDS such as TRIB2 . In addition, the comparison between transcriptional programs and GRNs regulating normal HSPCs and MDS HSPCs allowed the identification of regulons that were specifically active in MDS cases such as SMAD1 , HOXA6 , POU2F2 , and RUNX1 suggesting a role of these transcription factors ( TFs ) in the pathogenesis of the disease . In summary, the authors demonstrate that the combination of single-cell technologies with computational analysis tools enable the study of a variety of cellular mechanisms involved in complex biological systems such as early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with perturbations such as aging and malignant transformation. Furthermore, the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients.'
'Latent inhibition' is a type of learning in which an animal does not learn to associate a stimulus with a reward, even after repeated exposure to the stimulus. This type of learning is important for animals to ignore irrelevant stimuli and focus on more important ones. Honey bees show latent inhibition towards an odor they have experienced without reward. Individual honey bees from the same colony differ in their degree of latent inhibition, and these differences have a genetic basis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these individual differences, two honey bee lines were selected for high and low latent inhibition, respectively. These lines were crossed, and a Quantitative Trait Locus for latent inhibition was mapped to a region of the genome that contains the tyramine receptor gene Amtyr1. Further experiments showed that disruption of Amtyr1 signaling either pharmacologically or through RNAi qualitatively changed the expression of latent inhibition but had little or slight effects on appetitive conditioning. These results suggest that Amtyr1 modulates inhibitory processing in the central nervous system. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain during pharmacological blockade were consistent with a model that Amtyr1 indirectly regulates at inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system. The authors propose a neural model that suggests a mechanism for the broad pleiotropy this gene has on several different behaviors. The findings suggest that Amtyr1 is not causing latent inhibition but is modulating excitatory inputs to circuitry that drives stronger inhibitory hebbian plasticity. The model also suggests how this gene can exert broad pleiotropic effects on several different behaviors by acting as a gain control in different types of neural circuits or physiological processes. The findings are important for understanding how colonies use different strategies to explore for and exploit pollen and nectar resources.'
'The airway epithelium is composed of many different cell types that work together to maintain normal lung function. However, identifying and studying these cells can be challenging because they are difficult to distinguish from each other. In this study, the authors developed a new method to identify and study different cell types in the airway epithelium using the natural fluorescence of molecules called NAD(P)H and FAD. These molecules are important for cellular metabolism and are naturally present in all cells. By analyzing the unique fluorescence signatures of these molecules, the authors were able to distinguish between different cell types in the airway epithelium. They also used this method to study the dynamic behavior of secretory cells in response to cholinergic stimulation. The authors' method provides a new tool for studying the airway epithelium and could be used to better understand the function of different cell types in this important organ.'
 'Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of adult heart to regenerate after injury . N6-methyladenosine ( m6A ) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 ( Mettl3 ) plays an important role in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses . However , the role of m6A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear . To study m6A function in heart regeneration , the authors modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo . Knockdown of Mettl3 significantly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice . However , Mettl3 overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice . Conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing ( MeRIP-seq ) and RNA-seq identified Fgf16 as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification during postnatal heart regeneration . RIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Mettl3 negatively regulates Fgf16 mRNA expression in an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent manner . The silencing of Fgf16 suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes . However , the overexpression of ΔFgf16 , in which the m6A consensus sequence was mutated , significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16 . The authors therefore demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces Fgf16 mRNA levels through an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent pathway , thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration .

 'The risk of developing a second primary cancer (SPC) after the first primary cancer (FPC) has been diagnosed and treated is increasing. The underlying causal relationship is unclear. In this study, the authors conducted a pan-cancer association study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. They found 11 significant cross-correlations among different cancers after harmonizing the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) results. Whereas only 4 of them were confirmed by MR to have a robust causal relationship. For example, patients initially diagnosed with oral pharyngeal cancer would have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Meanwhile, ovary cancer was identified to be a risk factor for soft tissue cancer. And kidney cancer was likely to cause the development of lung cancer and myeloma. The authors suggest that certain types of primary cancer may cause another second primary cancer, and the profound mechanisms need to be studied in the future.

'Economic decision-making is a common process in everyday life, and humans and nonhuman primates often make choices while shifting their gaze between the available options. Recent studies in humans have shown that gaze behavior can influence the decision-making process, manifesting as a bias in favor of the items that are viewed first, viewed last, or viewed for the longest duration in a given trial. In this study, the authors developed a novel value-based choice task for macaque monkeys that captures the essential features of the human paradigms in which gaze biases have been observed. Using this task, the authors identified gaze biases in the monkeys that were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in humans. In addition, the monkeys’ gaze biases were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework previously used to describe gaze biases in humans. Together, these findings suggest a common mechanism that can explain gaze-related choice biases across species, and open the way for mechanistic studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.'
'Most phytophagous insects have a limited diet breadth and specialize on a few or a single host plant. However, some species display a remarkably large diet breadth, with host plants spanning several families and many species. It is unclear whether this phylogenetic generalism is supported by a generic metabolic use of common host chemical compounds (‘metabolic generalism’) or alternatively by distinct uses of diet-specific compounds (‘multi-host metabolic specialism’). Here, we simultaneously investigated the metabolomes of fruit diets and of individuals of a generalist phytophagous species, Drosophila suzukii, that developed on them. The direct comparison of metabolomes of diets and consumers enabled us to disentangle the metabolic fate of common and rarer dietary compounds. We showed that the consumption of biochemically dissimilar diets resulted in a canalized, generic response from generalist individuals, consistent with the metabolic generalism hypothesis. We also showed that many diet-specific metabolites, such as those related to the particular color, odor, or taste of diets, were not metabolized, and rather accumulated in consumer individuals, even when probably detrimental to fitness. As a result, while individuals were mostly similar across diets, the detection of their particular diet was straightforward. Our study thus supports the view that dietary generalism may emerge from a passive, opportunistic use of various resources, contrary to more widespread views of an active role of adaptation in this process. Such a passive stance towards dietary chemicals might favor the later evolution of new diet specializations.'
 'Yersinia pestis is a bacterium that causes the bubonic plague. It evolved from a less virulent ancestor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, through a series of genetic changes. One of these changes was a frameshift mutation in the rcsD gene, which encodes a protein called RcsD. This mutation resulted in the production of a smaller protein called RcsD-Hpt, which is important for the Rcs signaling pathway. The Rcs signaling pathway helps Y. pestis to form biofilms, which are communities of bacteria that stick together and can cause infections. The Rcs signaling pathway also helps Y. pestis to survive in the flea gut, which is important for the flea-borne transmission of the plague. The rcsD frameshift mutation may have been important for the evolution of Y. pestis and its ability to cause plague outbreaks.'
'The peer review process is a crucial step in the publication of scientific research, but concerns have been raised about its subjectivity. To investigate this issue, the author analyzed over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022–2023. The author used OpenAI's generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, to analyze language use in these reports, which demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional lexicon- and rule-based language models. The author found that most reviews for these published papers were seen as favorable by ChatGPT (89.8% of reviews), and language use was mostly polite (99.8% of reviews). However, this analysis also demonstrated high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results further revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. In addition, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author. The author discusses potential causes for this finding. Together, this study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts. As a proof of concept, the author shows that ChatGPT can identify areas of concern in scientific peer review, underscoring the importance of transparent peer review in studying equitability in scientific publishing.'
 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer that can spread to the liver, which is a poor prognostic factor. New strategies to reduce the risk of liver CRC colonization are needed. In this study, the authors used mouse models of hepatic metastatization to demonstrate that continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of interferon-alpha (IFNα) controls CRC invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). IFNα promoted the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) defenestration, extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition, thus strengthening the liver vascular barrier and impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration. IFNα also endowed LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential, which supported the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and ultimately led to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.'
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major public health concern in humans and animals. IAV is a rapidly evolving virus that can reassort with other strains to create new viruses with pandemic potential. Vaccination is the primary tool for controlling IAV in pigs, but it can also increase the risk of reassortment. In this study, researchers analyzed the genetic diversity of IAV in pigs that were vaccinated and unvaccinated and co-infected with two different strains of IAV. They found that vaccination had little impact on the genetic diversity of IAV in pigs. However, they did find that vaccination reduced the number of days that pigs were co-infected with both strains of IAV, which could potentially reduce the risk of reassortment. The researchers suggest that further studies are needed to understand how vaccination affects the evolution of IAV in pigs and to develop more effective vaccines that can reduce the risk of reassortment.

'The hippocampus is a brain region that plays a crucial role in memory formation and storage. One of the ways that the hippocampus stores memories is through the formation of connections between neurons. These connections are formed based on the spatial location of the neurons and the type of information that they process. However, it is not clear whether these connections are stable over time or if they change as new memories are formed. In this study, researchers used a technique called calcium imaging to record the activity of neurons in the hippocampus of rats as they navigated through a maze. They found that the connections between neurons changed over time, and that these changes were related to the formation of new memories. This suggests that the connections between neurons in the hippocampus are dynamic and change as new memories are formed.'
 'HIV-1 infection results in the activation of inflammasome that may facilitate viral spread and establishment of viral reservoirs . We evaluated the effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells . Expression of caspase-1 , NLRP3 , and IL-1β was increased in lymph nodes and bone marrow between day 1 and 3 after HIV-1 infection ( mean fold change ( FC ) of 2 . 08 , 3 . 23 , and 6 . 05 , p<0 . 001 , respectively ) . IFI16 and AIM2 expression peaked at day 24 and coincides with increased IL-18 levels ( 6 . 89 vs 83 . 19 pg/ml , p=0 . 004 ) , increased viral load and CD4+ T cells loss in blood ( p<0 . 005 and p<0 . 0001 , for the spleen respectively ) . Treatment with VX-765 significantly reduced TNF-α at day 11 ( 0 . 47 vs 2 . 2 pg/ml , p=0 . 045 ) , IL-18 at day 22 ( 7 . 8 vs 23 . 2 pg/ml , p=0 . 04 ) , CD4+ T cells ( 44 . 3% vs 36 , 7% , p=0 . 01 ) , viral load ( 4 . 26 vs 4 . 89 log 10 copies/ml , p=0 . 027 ) , and total HIV-1 DNA in the spleen ( 1 054 vs 2 889 copies /106 cells , p=0 . 029 ) . We demonstrated that targeting inflammasome activation early after infection may represent a therapeutic strategy towards HIV cure to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion and reduce immune activation , viral load , and the HIV-1 reservoir formation .'
 'The loss of a loved one is a traumatic experience that can lead to long-lasting changes in behavior and physiology. However, for most people, these changes subside over time. In this study, the authors investigated the process of loss adaptation in prairie voles, a socially monogamous rodent species that forms pair bonds with opposite-sex partners. The authors found that pair bond-associated behaviors persist despite prolonged separation, while pair bond-associated transcriptional signatures erode over time. The authors also identified specific genes and pathways that are sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation, providing insight into the neuromolecular changes that may contribute to loss adaptation.'
 'Motor variability is a fundamental feature of developing systems that allows motor exploration and learning. In human infants, leg movements involve a small number of basic coordination patterns called locomotor primitives, but whether and when motor variability could emerge from these primitives remains unknown. Here, researchers followed 18 infants from birth to walking onset and recorded the activity of their leg muscles during locomotor or rhythmic movements. Using unsupervised machine learning, they show that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development. In the neonatal period, infants own a minimal number of motor primitives but generate a maximal motor variability across trials thanks to variable activations of these primitives. A few months later, toddlers generate significantly less variability despite the existence of more primitives due to more regularity within their activation. These results suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration as soon as birth by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives that later fraction and become more consistently activated by the motor system.'
The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium (GTGC) is a collaborative effort to aggregate and analyze genomic data of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever. The consortium includes data from 13,000 isolates collected from 100 countries, providing a comprehensive picture of the global genetic diversity of Typhi. The analysis revealed that the majority of Typhi genomes belong to a single clade, H58, which is predominantly found in Asia and Africa. The consortium also identified emerging lineages of Typhi, including those with high levels of antimicrobial resistance, and provided insights into the evolution of Typhi over the past 21 years. The GTGC aims to provide a platform for future research and surveillance of Typhi, and to inform public health policies and interventions.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of a specific region of the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) gene in the vernalization process. Vernalization is a process in which plants are exposed to cold temperatures to promote flowering. The authors found that a region of the FLC gene called the 3′-end contains CRT/DRE binding factors (CBFs) that are required for the cold-induced expression of COOLAIR, an antisense RNA that helps repress FLC. The authors also found that CBFs bind to CRT/DREs in the 3′-end of FLC both in vitro and in vivo, and that CBF levels increase gradually during vernalization. The authors show that COOLAIR is induced by CBFs during early stages of vernalization but COOLAIR levels decrease in later phases as FLC chromatin transitions to an inactive state to which CBFs can no longer bind. The authors also demonstrate that cbfs and FLCΔCOOLAIR mutants exhibit a normal vernalization response despite their inability to activate COOLAIR expression during cold, revealing that COOLAIR is not required for the vernalization process. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the vernalization process in plants.
 'HIV-1 reservoir cells that circulate in peripheral blood during suppressive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) have been well characterized , but little is known about the dissemination of HIV-1-infected cells across multiple anatomical tissues , especially the CNS . Here , we performed single-genome , near full-length HIV-1 next-generation sequencing to evaluate the proviral landscape in distinct anatomical compartments , including multiple CNS tissues , from 3 ART-treated participants at autopsy . While lymph nodes and , to a lesser extent , gastrointestinal and genitourinary tissues represented tissue hotspots for the persistence of intact proviruses , we also observed intact proviruses in CNS tissue sections , particularly in the basal ganglia . Multi-compartment dissemination of clonal intact and defective proviral sequences occurred across multiple anatomical tissues , including the CNS , and evidence for the clonal proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells was found in the basal ganglia , in the frontal lobe , in the thalamus and in periventricular white matter . Deep analysis of HIV-1 reservoirs in distinct tissues will be informative for advancing HIV-1 cure strategies .'
'Circadian rhythms are a type of biological clock that regulates many of our daily activities, such as sleep and hormone release. These rhythms are controlled by a group of proteins called the circadian clock, which is found in almost every tissue in the body. However, it is not clear how these clocks are regulated in different tissues. In this study, the authors developed a new method to measure the activity of circadian clocks in different tissues of live flies. They found that different tissues have different patterns of clock activity, and that the loss of a protein called PDF, which is important for the function of the brain clock, affects different tissues in different ways. This study provides new insights into how circadian clocks are regulated in different tissues, and could help us understand how circadian rhythms are disrupted in diseases such as sleep disorders and cancer.'
'Endosomes are organelles that receive, sort and recycle proteins and lipids from cellular compartments. The process of sorting and recycling requires the help of coat proteins that bind to cargo and form carriers that are transported to the endosome. In yeast, the retromer complex is a coat protein that sorts cargo from the endosome. The retromer complex is composed of a trimer of Vps26, Vps35 and Vps29, and a dimer of Vps5 and Vps17. The retromer complex is important for the recycling of proteins from the endosome to the plasma membrane. In metazoans, the retromer complex is also important for the recycling of proteins from the endosome to the plasma membrane. However, the function of the yeast homolog of the retromer complex, Vrl1, has been overlooked due to an inactivating mutation found in commonly studied strains. In this study, the authors demonstrate that Vrl1 has features of a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms an obligate complex with Vin1, the paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5. The VINE complex occupies endosomal tubules and redistributes a conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like protein from endosomes. The authors also find that membrane recruitment by Vin1 is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity, suggesting that VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome. The study provides new insights into the function of the yeast retromer complex and its homologs in metazoans.'
 'In the early 1950s, a patient named Henry Molaison underwent an experimental brain surgery to treat his severe epilepsy. The surgeon removed a region of the brain known as the temporal lobe from both sides of his brain. After the surgery, Molaison's epilepsy was greatly improved, but he was left with a profound amnesia, unable to form new memories of recent events. Subsequent experiments, including many with Molaison himself as a subject, have attempted to identify the roles of the various structures within the temporal lobes. The hippocampus, which is involved in memory and spatial navigation, has received the most attention. However, in recent years, the entorhinal cortex, which is the gateway to the hippocampus, has come to the fore. In rats and mice, the entorhinal cortex can be divided into two subregions that have distinct connections to other parts of the temporal lobe and to the rest of the brain. These are the medial entorhinal cortex, which is the subregion nearest the center of the brain, and the lateral entorhinal cortex, which is to the left or right of the center. For many years, researchers had assumed that human entorhinal subregions were located simply to the center or to the sides of the brain. However, it was difficult to check this as the entorhinal cortex measures less than 1 cm across, which placed it beyond the reach of most brain-imaging techniques. Now, two independent groups of researchers have used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the human entorhinal cortex is predominantly divided from front-to-back in humans. The fMRI data—which were collected in a magnetic field of 7 Tesla, rather than the 1.5 Tesla used in previous experiments—reveal that the entorhinal cortex is divided into anterior-lateral and posterior-medial subregions. In one of these experiments, functional MRI was used to measure activity across the whole brain as subjects performed a virtual reality task: this task included some components that involved spatial navigation and other components that did not. The other group used the imaging data to show that the pattern of connections between the anterior-lateral subregion and the hippocampus was different to that between the posterior-medial subregion and the hippocampus. The discovery of these networks in the temporal lobe in humans will help to bridge the gap between studies of memory in rodents and in humans. Given that the lateral entorhinal cortex is one of the first regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, identifying the specific properties and roles of these networks could also provide insights into disease mechanisms.'
 'The avian palaeognath phylogeny has been recently revised due to advancements in genome-wide comparative analyses. This provides an opportunity to trace the evolution of the microstructure and crystallography of modern dinosaur eggshells. Here, eggshells of all major clades of Palaeognathae (including extinct taxa) and selected eggshells of Neognathae and non-avian dinosaurs are analyzed with electron backscatter diffraction. The results show the detailed microstructures and crystallographies of previously loosely categorized ostrich-, rhea-, and tinamou-style morphotypes of palaeognath eggshells. All rhea-style eggshell appears homologous, while ostrich-style and tinamou-style morphotypes are best interpreted as homoplastic morphologies (independently acquired). Ancestral state reconstruction and parsimony analysis additionally show that rhea-style eggshell represents the ancestral state of palaeognath eggshells both in microstructure and crystallography. The ornithological and palaeontological implications of the current study are not only helpful for understanding the evolution of modern and extinct dinosaur eggshells but also aid other disciplines where palaeognath eggshells provide useful archive for comparative contrasts (e.g., palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, geochronology, and zooarchaeology).', Keyword: 'evolutionary biology'

We analyze mouse courtship interactions and demonstrate that males and females vocalize in starkly different relative spatial positions , and that the fraction of female vocalizations has likely been overestimated previously due to imprecise localization . Further , we find that when two male mice interact with one female , one of the males takes a dominant role in the interaction both in terms of the vocalization rate and the location relative to the female . HyVL substantially improves the precision with which social communication between rodents can be studied . It is also affordable , open-source , easy to set up , can be integrated with existing setups , and reduces the required number of experiments and animals .'
 'Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle cells that produce force. They are made up of long chains of actin and myosin filaments that are linked together by a protein called titin. Titin is a huge protein that spans the entire length of the sarcomere in vertebrates. In Drosophila, there are two titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, that are thought to be responsible for the nanoarchitecture of the sarcomere. In this study, the authors used nanobodies to determine the precise location of these two proteins in the sarcomere of Drosophila flight muscles. They found that Sallimus is located at the Z-disc and the M-band, while Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band. The authors also found that the two proteins are staggered, with the end of Sallimus overlapping with the beginning of Projectin. This staggered organization may help to ensure that force is transmitted efficiently across the sarcomere. The study provides important insights into the nanoarchitecture of the sarcomere in Drosophila and may help to explain how sarcomere length is determined in these muscles.'
 'This study presents a new method for measuring the viscoelastic properties of individual cells. The method uses a microfluidic device to apply shear stress to cells suspended in a high-viscosity fluid. The resulting deformations of the cells are captured using a camera and analyzed to extract the storage and loss moduli of the cells. The method is simple, low-cost, and high-throughput, making it suitable for use in high-throughput screening applications. The study demonstrates the accuracy of the method using calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells. The method is shown to be useful for studying the viscoelastic properties of cells in different conditions, such as after drug treatment or during the cell cycle. The study also demonstrates the usefulness of the method for studying the viscoelastic properties of cells in a tank-treading manner.'
 'Mitochondria are organelles found in all eukaryotic cells that produce energy for the cell to function. They are particularly important for the heart, which relies heavily on mitochondria to produce energy. However, mitochondria can become damaged or dysfunctional, which can lead to a variety of diseases. One such disease is cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that affects the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure. Researchers have found that mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called mitofusin 2 (MFN2) are associated with cardiomyopathy. However, it is not clear how these mutations cause the disease. In this study, the researchers used a computer model to investigate the effects of different MFN2 mutations on mitochondrial function. They found that some mutations impaired mitochondrial fusion, which is the process by which mitochondria combine to form larger structures. Other mutations did not affect mitochondrial fusion but did impair mitochondrial transport or mitophagy, which is the process by which damaged mitochondria are removed from the cell. The researchers also created mice with these mutations and found that they developed cardiomyopathy. They also found that the mice had abnormalities in their mitochondria that were similar to those seen in people with mitochondrial diseases. The researchers concluded that different MFN2 mutations can cause different types of mitochondrial dysfunction, which can lead to different types of diseases. They also suggested that further research into the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by MFN2 mutations could lead to new treatments for these diseases.'
 'Mice are a popular model organism for studying the effects of early life experiences on later health outcomes. Several studies have shown that interventions in the first few weeks of life can have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later life. For example, exposure to growth hormone injections in the first few weeks of life can reduce lifespan in mice. In this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that olfactory cues can also have long-lasting effects on lifespan in mice. They found that female mice exposed to odors from adult females from 3 days to 60 days of age had a significantly longer lifespan than control females. In contrast, male mice did not have their lifespan extended by exposure to female odors. The authors suggest that these findings could have implications for understanding the effects of early life experiences on later health outcomes in humans.'
'Chemogenetics is a powerful tool for studying the role of specific neuronal populations in sleep regulation. However, the effects of commonly used chemogenetic actuators, such as clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), on sleep have never been systematically tested. In this study, we found that intraperitoneal injections of commonly used CNO doses (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) altered sleep in wild-type male laboratory mice. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to analyze sleep, we found a dose-dependent suppression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, changes in EEG spectral power during NREM sleep, and altered sleep architecture in a pattern previously reported for clozapine. These effects could arise from back-metabolism to clozapine or binding to endogenous neurotransmitter receptors. Interestingly, we found that the novel DREADD actuator, compound 21 (C21, 3 mg/kg), similarly modulates sleep despite a lack of back-metabolism to clozapine. Our results demonstrate that both CNO and C21 can modulate sleep of mice not expressing DREADD receptors. This implies that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying side effects of chemogenetic actuators. Therefore, any chemogenetic experiment should include a DREADD-free control group injected with the same CNO, C21, or newly developed actuator. We suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators.'
 'Microorganisms navigate their environment through the detection and response to chemical signals via chemotaxis. This fundamental survival mechanism regulates many biological processes, such as microbial foraging and reproduction. Microfluidic devices have become an indispensable platform for studying microbial chemotaxis by providing precise control over the chemical environment at scales relevant to swimming cells. However, the vast landscape of potential chemical compounds, combinations of compounds, and concentration gradient conditions that regulate these important processes necessitates the development of new high-throughput devices. Here, we present a novel microfluidic multiplexed chemotaxis device (MCD) that uses serial dilution to simultaneously perform six parallel bacterial chemotaxis assays that span five orders of magnitude in chemostimulant concentration on a single chip. We first validated the dilution and gradient generation performance of the MCD, and then compared the measured chemotactic response of an established bacterial chemotaxis system (Vibrio alginolyticus) to a standard microfluidic assay. Next, the MCD’s versatility was assessed by quantifying the chemotactic responses of different bacteria (Pseudomonas haloplanktis, Escherichia coli) to different chemoattractants and chemorepellents. The MCD vastly accelerates the chemotactic screening process, which is critical to deciphering the complex sea of chemical stimuli underlying microbial responses.

 'Neural crest cells are a group of cells that play a crucial role in the development of the nervous system, facial structures, and other tissues in animals. These cells undergo a series of events, including induction, specification, and migration, to form these tissues. Recent studies have shown that post-transcriptional regulation, such as RNA stabilization by RNA-binding proteins, also plays an important role in neural crest development. In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA-sequencing data to identify potential post-transcriptional regulators that are enriched in neural crest cells. They found that Elavl1, which encodes for an RNA-binding protein, was enriched in premigratory cranial neural crest cells. The authors then used chick embryos to study the role of Elavl1 in neural crest development. They found that Elavl1 knockdown led to premature neural crest delamination and a significant reduction in the expression of genes associated with neural crest specification. The authors then showed that Draxin, a direct target of Elavl1, was the primary target for stabilization by Elavl1 during cranial neural crest specification. They also showed that exogenous Draxin could rescue the cranial neural crest specification defects observed with Elavl1 knockdown. The authors concluded that Elavl1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of cranial neural crest specification via Draxin mRNA stabilization. Their findings highlight the important intersection of post-transcriptional regulation with modulation of the neural crest specification GRN.'
 'Respiration is a vital process for life, and it is controlled by complex neural networks in the brainstem and spinal cord. The ability of phrenic motor neurons (MNs) to receive and integrate descending inputs from the brainstem is essential for breathing, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie this connectivity are not well understood. In this study, the authors show that coordinated activity of type I and II cadherins is required for robust respiratory output. Both MN- and Dbx1-specific cadherin inactivation in mice during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. The authors further show that cadherins establish phrenic MN cell body positioning and dendritic orientation, but surprisingly find that cell body positioning is likely dispensable for proper phrenic MN firing. Finally, the authors show that cadherin signaling is required in Dbx1-derived interneurons, which give rise to the premotor rVRG, for phrenic MN bursting activity. Collectively, the results demonstrate that cadherins are vital to respiratory circuit assembly and function, and suggest a model where cadherin-mediated adhesive recognition dictates wiring specificity through multifaceted functions in dendritic organization and molecular recognition.'
 'Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media platforms, contributing to polarization, racism, and vaccine hesitancy. In this study, the authors tested whether the incentive structure of social media platforms, where social rewards are dissociated from the veracity of the information shared, facilitates the spread of misinformation. They found that a slight change to the incentive structure, such that social rewards and punishments are contingent on information veracity, produces a considerable increase in the discernment of shared information. The authors suggest that this intervention could be adopted to reduce misinformation spread, without reducing engagement, and thus reduce violence, vaccine hesitancy, and political polarization.

'Microtubules are filamentous polymers that play a central role in intracellular transport. They can also generate force and drive motility directly. During mitosis, for example, chromosomes remain persistently attached to the tips of disassembling microtubules, which pull the sister chromatids apart. According to the conformational wave hypothesis, this force generation requires that protofilaments curl outward from the disassembling tips to exert pulling force directly on kinetochores. Rigorously testing this idea will require modifying the mechanical and energetic properties of curling protofilaments, but no way to do so has yet been described. Here, by direct measurement of working strokes generated in vitro by curling protofilaments, we show that their mechanical energy output can be increased by adding magnesium, and that yeast microtubules generate larger and more energetic working strokes than bovine microtubules. Both the magnesium and species-dependent increases in work output can be explained by lengthening the protofilament curls, without any change in their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. These observations demonstrate how work output from curling protofilaments can be tuned and suggest evolutionary conservation of the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubule lattice.'
'Hagfishes are a group of jawless vertebrates that produce a unique form of defense against predators by rapidly ejecting mucus and threads into seawater. These threads and mucus combine to form a slime that is strong, viscoelastic, and can expand rapidly to trap large volumes of water. The origin of this slime is unknown, but circumstantial evidence suggests that it may have evolved from the epidermis. In this study, the authors describe large intracellular threads within a putatively homologous cell type from hagfish epidermis. These threads are ~2 mm in length and ~0.5 μm in diameter, and are produced by a cell type called epidermal thread cells (ETCs). ETCs are found throughout the hagfish body, with each square millimeter of skin containing ~96 cm of threads. When a hagfish is attacked, its skin releases threads and mucus that form an adhesive slime. The authors also found that ETCs are evolutionarily related to the thread-producing cells in the slime glands, and that the thread proteins expressed in hagfish skin are sisters to those found in slime glands. These findings suggest that slime glands may have arisen from epidermis, and that selection may have driven this transition to produce stronger and more voluminous slime.'
 'Temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) is a common form of drug-resistant epilepsy that can cause severe cognitive and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Current treatments are ineffective at controlling seizures and do not mitigate the severity, progression, or outcome of the epilepsy. Sodium selenate is a potential disease-modifying treatment that has been shown to reduce hyperphosphorylated tau and improve behavioral outcomes in animal models of epilepsy. In this study, the authors evaluated the effects of sodium selenate treatment in a rat model of TLE. They found that sodium selenate treatment was associated with reduced seizures, cognitive deficits, and sensorimotor deficits. The authors also found that sodium selenate treatment increased protein phosphatase 2A expression, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau, and reversed telomere length shortening. Network medicine integration of multi-omics/pre-clinical outcomes identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with TLE. The authors conclude that sodium selenate treatment results in a sustained disease-modifying effect in chronically epileptic rats in the post-KA SE model of TLE, including improved comorbid learning and memory deficits.

'Fragility fractures are associated with an increased risk of mortality, but this risk is not part of doctor-patient communication. In this study, the authors introduce a new concept called 'Skeletal Age' to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual. The authors used data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register to determine the hazard of mortality associated with a specific fracture for a given risk profile, and then transformed this hazard into years of life lost (YLL) using the Gompertz law of mortality. During the median follow-up period of 16 years, there were 307,870 fractures and 122,744 post-fracture deaths. The authors estimated 'Skeletal Age' for each age and fracture site stratified by gender. They found that a fracture was associated with between 1 and 7 years of life lost, with the loss being greater in men than women. Hip fractures incurred the greatest loss of life years. For instance, a 60-year-old individual with a hip fracture is estimated to have a 'Skeletal Age' of 66 for men and 65 for women. The authors propose 'Skeletal Age' as a new metric to assess the impact of a fragility fracture on an individual's life expectancy. This approach will enhance doctor-patient risk communication about the risks associated with osteoporosis.'
10 . 7554/eLife . 22169 . 007In this study, we developed a novel deep learning-based method called Brain Extraction Net (BEN) to extract brain tissue across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. BEN is a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network that can accurately extract brain tissue from MRI data collected from mice, rats, marmosets, macaques, and humans. BEN is also faster than traditional toolboxes and incorporates an uncertainty-based assessment module that allows it to autonomously control the quality of brain segmentation mask outputs. We evaluated BEN on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six MR scanners with various magnetic field strengths. Compared to conventional toolboxes, BEN is more robust, accurate, and generalizable. Our proposed method not only provides a generalized solution for extracting brain tissue across species but also significantly improves the accuracy of atlas registration, thereby benefiting the downstream processing tasks. As a novel fully automated deep-learning method, BEN is designed as an open-source software to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications.
 'Candida albicans is a fungal pathogen that can cause infections in humans. It can survive in environments with low levels of iron, and it uses heme as an alternative iron source. Heme is a molecule that contains iron and is found in many natural environments. C . albicans has a family of proteins called CFEM hemophores that can capture heme from host proteins and transfer it across the cell wall to the cell membrane, where it is endocytosed and utilized as heme or iron source. In this study, the authors identified two new proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, that are required for heme utilization and sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. These proteins are related to a group of proteins called ferric reductases, which are involved in reducing ferric iron to its more soluble ferrous form. The authors found that Frp1 and Frp2 redistribute to the plasma membrane in the presence of hemin, suggesting a direct role in heme trafficking. They also found that Frp1 and Frp2 can promote heme utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae when expressed with the CFEM hemophore Pga7. The authors conclude that Frp1 and Frp2 form a functional complex that evolved from ferric reductases to enable extracellular heme uptake.'
'The seventh pandemic of the diarrheal cholera disease, which began in 1960, is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Its environmental persistence provoking recurring sudden outbreaks is enabled by V . cholerae’s rapid adaption to changing environments involving sensory proteins like ToxR and ToxS. Located at the inner membrane, ToxR and ToxS react to environmental stimuli like bile acid, thereby inducing survival strategies for example bile resistance and virulence regulation. The presented crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS in combination with multiple bile acid interaction studies reveals that a bile binding pocket of ToxS is only properly folded upon binding to ToxR. Our data proposes an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. These findings support the previously suggested link between ToxRS and VtrAC-like co-component systems. Besides VtrAC, ToxRS is now the only experimentally determined structure within this recently defined superfamily, further emphasizing its significance. In-depth analysis of the ToxRS complex reveals its remarkable conservation across various Vibrio species, underlining the significance of conserved residues in the ToxS barrel and the more diverse ToxR sensory domain. Unravelling the intricate mechanisms governing ToxRS’s environmental sensing capabilities provides a promising tool for disruption of this vital interaction, ultimately inhibiting Vibrio’s survival and virulence. Our findings hold far-reaching implications for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings.'
 'The hippocampus is a key brain structure involved in memory formation and consolidation. It is composed of several subfields that are thought to play different roles in memory processes. However, the exact functions of these subfields are not fully understood. One way to study the functions of these subfields is through the examination of their connectivity patterns. In this study, the authors used a novel approach to examine the connectivity patterns of the hippocampus in humans. They used a combination of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and tractography to map the connectivity patterns of the hippocampus. They found that the hippocampus is connected to several different brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex. They also found that different subfields of the hippocampus are connected to different brain regions. These findings provide important insights into the connectivity patterns of the hippocampus and its subfields, which can help us better understand the functions of these structures in memory processes.'
 'Inflammation is a major driver of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a key player in the innate immune response to viral pathogens and can also be activated by cytoplasmic self-DNA. In this study, the authors used a mouse model with heterozygous expression of the STING genetic variant N153S to determine whether specific activation of STING is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. They found that STING activation led to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which project from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum. The authors also observed alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation was quantified by staining astroglia and microglia, by measuring mRNAs, proteins, and nuclear translocation of transcription factors. These neuroinflammatory markers were already elevated in juvenile mice, although at this age the number of dopaminergic neurons was still unaffected. More neuroinflammatory markers were blunted in mice deficient for inflammasomes than in mice deficient for signalling by type I interferons. Neurodegeneration, however, was blunted in both mice. The authors conclude that chronic activation of the STING pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and that targeting the STING pathway could be beneficial in PD and further neurodegenerative diseases.'
 'Immunotherapy has been a major breakthrough in cancer treatment, but it is not always effective. In this study, the authors found that tumor cells can evade immunotherapy by forming unique cell-in-cell structures that are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. These structures are formed by IFNγ-activated T cells, which induce phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT3 and EGR-1 in tumor cells. Inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. This work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism that enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity. The findings suggest that targeting these transcription factors could improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.'
'Theory of Mind (ToM)' refers to the ability to attribute mental states to other individuals. This ability extends even to the attribution of mental states to simple geometric shapes, such as the Frith-Happé animations. In these animations, two triangles move either purposelessly (Random condition), exhibit purely physical movement (Goal-directed condition), or move as if one triangle is reacting to the other triangle’s mental states (ToM condition). While this capacity in humans has been thoroughly established, research on nonhuman primates has yielded inconsistent results. This study explored how marmosets process Frith-Happé animations by examining gaze patterns and brain activations of marmosets and humans as they observed these animations. We revealed that both marmosets and humans exhibited longer fixations on one of the triangles in ToM animations compared to other conditions. However, we did not observe the same pattern of longer overall fixation duration on the ToM animations in marmosets as identified in humans. Furthermore, our findings reveal that both species activated extensive and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM versus Random animations, suggesting that marmosets differentiate between these scenarios similarly to humans. While marmosets did not mimic human overall fixation patterns, their gaze behavior and neural activations indicate a distinction between ToM and non-ToM scenarios. This study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities, shedding light on potential similarities and differences in ToM processing between marmosets and humans.'
 'Expression of genes that promote stemness or differentiation must be properly controlled in stem cells to allow their progeny to transition through various intermediate stages of cell fate specification in a timely fashion . Transcriptional and translational control are both important for this regulation, but the fine-tuning of gene transcription is not well understood due to the compensatory effect of translational control. The authors used the intermediate neural progenitor ( INP ) identity commitment in fly neuroblasts to define the mechanisms that fine-tune stemness gene transcription. They found that the transcription factor FruitlessC ( FruC ) binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in neuroblasts. Loss of fruC function alone has no effect on INP commitment but drives INP dedifferentiation when translational control is reduced. FruC negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. The authors propose that low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.'
 'Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs naturally in the body to remove damaged or old cells. This process is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing inflammation. However, the clearance of apoptotic cells is not well understood. In this study, the authors found that neutrophils, not macrophages or other cells, are responsible for the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver. They found that neutrophils burrow directly into apoptotic hepatocytes and clear them from the inside, a process they termed perforocytosis. The authors also found that defects in neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes can lead to autoimmune liver disease. This study provides new insights into the role of neutrophils in maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing inflammation.'
 'Motor control is a complex process that involves the coordination of multiple muscles to perform movements. The spinal cord is responsible for controlling the activity of these muscles through a network of neurons. In particular, premotor neurons are responsible for sending signals to motor neurons, which then activate the muscles. However, the organization of these premotor neurons is not fully understood. In this study, the authors used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice to label premotor interneurons innervating specific motor pools. Contrary to expectations, they found that premotor interneurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components. The authors suggest that this organization may be advantageous for the flexibility and adaptability of motor control. Their findings provide new insights into the organization of spinal circuits and the mechanisms underlying motor control. '
'Respiration can affect the BOLD signal in resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) in two ways: slow respiration variations and fast cyclic changes. Slow respiration variations can induce motion and CO2 fluctuation during rsfMRI scans, leading to non-neural artifacts in the rsfMRI signal. Fast cyclic changes can induce changes in the static magnetic field, which in turn lead to BOLD signal changes. However, there is evidence hinting at a possible neural component in the respiration–rsfMRI interaction. Respiration can directly drive brain-wide neuronal oscillations, and respiration changes can be associated with arousal and/or emotion-related brain state changes. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between respiration, neuronal activity, and rsfMRI signal, the authors simultaneously acquired rsfMRI, electrophysiology, and respiration data in anesthetized rats. Based on these measures, an RVT-correlated rsfMRI network was identified. Importantly, regressing out gamma activity or silencing neural activity across the brain disrupted this respiration-related network, suggesting that this respiration–rsfMRI relationship is mediated by neural activity.'
 'This study investigates the foraging behavior of greater mouse-eared bats using biologging devices and DNA metabarcoding of feces. The bats were found to use two foraging strategies: gleaning and hawking. Gleaning is the primary foraging tactic, but the bats switch to hawking when environmental changes reduce the profitability of ground prey. The study concludes that prey switching matched to environmental dynamics plays a key role in covering the energy intake even in specialized predators. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the foraging behavior of echolocating bats and other specialized predators.'
 'The evolution of human right-handedness has been a topic of intense debate for decades. While some researchers have suggested that right-handedness is an evolutionary adaptation that emerged in response to the demands of complex tool use, others have argued that it is a byproduct of other evolutionary pressures. In this study, the authors used a comparative approach to examine the evolution of manual lateralization in primates. They compiled data from 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans, and used quantitative phylogenetic methods to test various hypotheses about the evolution of primate manual lateralization. The authors found that human right-handedness is an extreme among anthropoids and that species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates. They also found that taxa displaying population-level handedness were rare and that the strength of hand preference varied across species. The authors suggest that the evolution of human right-handedness is unlikely to be explained by ecological factors or tool use, and that it may instead be a byproduct of other evolutionary pressures. Their findings challenge popular ideas about the evolution of human right-handedness and suggest that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species.'
 'Williams–Beuren syndrome ( WBS ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and hypersocial phenotype . The endocannabinoid system ( ECS ) could be a potential target for treating WBS. We analyzed the components of the ECS in a mouse model of WBS and found alterations in CB1R expression and G-protein coupling. Subchronic administration of the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 normalized social behavior and memory alterations in the WBS mouse model. This treatment also partially restored cardiovascular deficits and cardiac transcriptional alterations. Our results suggest that modifying the endocannabinoid signaling could be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating WBS. '
 'During development, an organism goes through different stages that are characterized by distinct morphological and molecular changes. In humans, for example, development progresses from childhood through to puberty and then to adulthood, when sexual maturity is attained. Similarly, in holometabolous insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, the developmental stages are sharply defined: embryogenesis gives rise to the larva, a juvenile stage, which, upon different rounds of growth and moulting, brings about a new stage structure, the pupa, when most of the larval cells die and the adult progenitor cells (imaginal cells) develop to generate the adult organism. The regulation of stage-specific differences is mediated by the action of two major developmental hormones, the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone and the terpenoid juvenile hormone. Both hormones exert this precise developmental control by regulating the expression of three critical genes that encode for the stage-identity factors that compose the metamorphic gene network: the C2H2 zinc finger type factor Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), the helix-turn-helix Ecdysone inducible protein 93F (E93), and Broad-complex (Br-C; also known as broad), a member of the bric-a-brac-tramtrack-broad family. The deployment of the pupal-specific genetic program is controlled by the expression of Br-C at the larval-pupal transition. Upon the formation of the pupa, hormone signalling triggers the expression of the helix-turn-helix factor E93, whose product represses Br-C expression and directs the formation of the final differentiated adult structures. While it is firmly established that Br-C and E93 are the stage-specifying genes for the pupal and adult states, the nature of the larval specifying gene has been elusive. To date, larval identity has been attributed to Kr-h1, which is present during the larval period and represses Br-C and E93 expression during this period. However, although Kr-h1 is undoubtedly critical for maintaining the larval state, evidence has shown that this factor cannot be considered the larval specifier per se. For example, depletion of Kr-h1 in Drosophila does not prevent normal larval development nor a timely transition to the pupa. In this regard, the product of chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis (chinmo) gene, another member of the BTB family of transcription factors, has been recently proposed to be responsible for larval identity in Drosophila. First isolated based on its requirement for the temporal identity of mushroom body neurons (Zhu et al., 2006), the identification of Chinmo as a more general larval specifier has provided invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of juvenile identity. Yet, little is known about how this factor exerts its function along with Br-C and E93. Moreover, in the sequential activation of chinmo, Br-C, and E93, the extent of the activity directly attributable to each transcription factor or to their mutual repression is still unclear. Here, we confirm the role of chinmo as larval specifier in larval and imaginal cells and establish its regulatory interactions with the other temporal specifiers. We also examine how the temporal sequence of Chinmo and Br-C differently affects with the genetic program that establishes larval vs. imaginal identity. Thus, we found that Chinmo controls larval development of larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. According to these data, and in the context of the metamorphic gene network, we also show that chinmo absence is critical for the transition from larva to pupa and then to adult, as it acts as a repressor of both Br-C and E93. In addition, we report that the chinmo homologue has a similar role in the cockroach Blattella germanica, thereby indicating that its function as a juvenile specifier precedes the hemimetabolous/holometabolous split. Finally, we show that in contrast to the well-characterised role of chinmo as a pro-oncogene, the Br-C pupal and E93 adult specifiers act mainly as tumour suppressor genes. These characteristics are maintained beyond insects and may account for the different role of some human
 'Metabolism is a complex system of reactions that occur within cells to produce energy and other molecules necessary for life. The rate at which these reactions occur is known as flux, and it is influenced by a variety of factors, including the availability of substrates, the activity of enzymes, and the overall structure of the metabolic network. In this study, the authors developed a mathematical framework to analyze the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux. Co-substrate cycling refers to the process by which a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions. The authors found that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct to the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalyzing that reaction. Using analytical methods, the authors showed that this additional limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. The authors then expanded their analysis to include branched and coupled pathways and found that regulation of these two parameters can allow regulation of flux dynamics in these systems. The authors also analyzed existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from central carbon metabolism and identified several reactions that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. The authors conclude that measuring and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells.'
 'Articular cartilage is a specialized tissue that covers the ends of bones in joints and allows for smooth movement. The development of articular cartilage is not well understood, and it is difficult to identify the cells that give rise to it. In this study, the authors found that a protein called NFATc1 is expressed in cells that give rise to articular cartilage during development. They also found that NFATc1 is important for the differentiation of these cells into articular cartilage. The authors suggest that NFATc1 could be a potential target for therapies aimed at repairing damaged articular cartilage.'
 'Photosystem II (PSII) is a key enzyme in oxygenic photosynthesis that uses light energy to convert water into oxygen and reduce plastoquinone. Two types of PSII can use chlorophyll d (Chl-d) and chlorophyll f (Chl-f) to perform the same reactions using lower energy far-red light. Chl-d-PSII from Acaryochloris marina has Chl-d replacing all but one of its 35 Chl-a, while Chl-f-PSII from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis has just 4 Chl-f and 1 Chl-d and 30 Chl-a. From bioenergetic considerations, the far-red PSII were predicted to lose photochemical efficiency and/or resilience to photodamage. Here, we compare enzyme turnover efficiency, forward electron transfer, back-reactions, and photodamage in Chl-f-PSII, Chl-d-PSII, and Chl-a-PSII. We show that: (i) all types of PSII have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover; (ii) the modified energy gaps on the acceptor side of Chl-d-PSII favor recombination via PD1+Phe- repopulation, leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII; (iii) the acceptor-side energy gaps in Chl-f-PSII are tuned to avoid harmful back reactions, favoring resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage. The results are explained by the differences in the redox tuning of the electron transfer cofactors Phe and QA and in the number and layout of the chlorophylls that share the excitation energy with the primary electron donor. PSII has adapted to lower energy in two distinct ways, each appropriate for its specific environment but with different functional penalties.'
The skeletal system is a complex organ that plays a crucial role in movement, support, hematopoiesis, immune responses, and endocrine regulation. The skeletal system is composed of various cell lineages that arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These cell lineages are critical for maintaining the integrity of the skeletal system during development and aging. However, the precise role of osteocytes, the long-living terminally differentiated cells within the bone matrix, in regulating these cell lineages is not well understood. In this study, we used a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes to investigate their role in regulating lineage cell fates in bone and bone marrow. We found that osteocyte ablation caused severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan in these animals. Osteocyte reduction altered mesenchymal lineage commitment, resulting in impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed that hematopoietic lineage was mobilized toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes, while the lymphopoiesis was impaired with reduced B cells in the osteocyte ablation mice. The acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells was the underlying cause. Together, we showed that osteocytes play critical roles in regulation of lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow through mediation of senescence.
10 . 7554/eLife . 07864 . 003The long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) is a model for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations. In this study, the authors characterize the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across 12 replicate populations evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations. They find that all evolved lines have more mRNAs and that this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. Despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations in the LTEE are remarkably similar in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The majority of the expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level with very few translational changes. The authors also show how mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.
 'The liver is a vital organ that can regenerate itself after being damaged. When two-thirds of the liver is removed, the remaining part of the liver grows back to its original size. This process is called liver regeneration. Researchers have been trying to understand how this happens. They have found that a protein called CD133 is important for liver regeneration. CD133 is also found in cancer cells and is thought to be a marker of cancer stem cells. In this study, researchers found that when a protein called Shp2 was removed from hepatocytes, the cells that were able to divide formed clusters and expressed more CD133. They also found that CD133+ cells were able to exchange mRNAs with each other, which helped them to divide more efficiently. These findings suggest that CD133 plays a role in intercellular communication and helps cells to divide more efficiently when they are not able to divide as easily. This could be important for understanding how cancer cells grow and divide.'
 'Ciliopathies are a group of diseases that affect the primary cilium, a microtubule-based organelle found in most mammalian cells. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision loss, kidney and brain abnormalities, and bone defects. In this study, researchers used retinal organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of rd16 mice, a model of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) type 10, to screen over 6000 bioactive small molecules for their ability to maintain photoreceptor survival. They identified five non-toxic positive hits, including the lead molecule reserpine, which improved photoreceptor development and survival in rd16 organoids. Reserpine also improved photoreceptor survival in organoids derived from LCA10 patients and in rd16 mouse retina in vivo. Further investigation revealed that reserpine modulated signaling pathways related to cell survival/death, metabolism, and proteostasis. The researchers also discovered dysregulation of autophagy associated with compromised primary cilium biogenesis in patient organoids and rd16 mouse retina. Reserpine partially restored the balance between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system at least in part by increasing the cargo adaptor p62, resulting in improved primary cilium assembly. The study identifies effective drug candidates in preclinical studies of CEP290 retinal ciliopathies through cross-species drug discovery using iPSC-derived organoids, highlights the impact of proteostasis in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies, and provides new insights for treatments of retinal neurodegeneration.'
'Bees are exposed to a variety of plant metabolites while foraging, which can have both positive and negative effects on their health. While bees have enzymes that can help metabolize these compounds, they also rely on their gut microbiota to help break them down. In this study, the authors found that amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in honey bee-pollinated almond trees, can be metabolized by both bees and members of their gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In microbiota-colonized bees, on the other hand, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut, suggesting that the microbiota contribute to the full degradation of amygdalin into hydrogen cyanide. The authors found that strains of Bifidobacterium, Bombilactobacillus, and Gilliamella can degrade amygdalin. The degradation mechanism appears to vary since only some strains produce prunasin as an intermediate. Finally, the authors investigated the basis of degradation in Bifidobacterium wkB204, a strain that fully degrades amygdalin. They found overexpression and secretion of several carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, including one in glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3). They expressed this GH3 in Escherichia coli and detected prunasin as a byproduct when cell lysates were cultured with amygdalin, supporting its contribution to amygdalin degradation. These findings demonstrate that both host and microbiota can act together to metabolize dietary plant metabolites.'
'Candida albicans is a fungus that can cause severe invasive candidiasis in humans . The virulence factor candidalysin ( CL ) is secreted by C . albicans and causes damage to target cell membranes . However , the mechanism by which CL damages membranes is unclear . In this study, Wilhelm et al . used biophysical techniques to investigate the mechanism of CL action . They found that CL forms polymers in solution, which then insert into the membrane to become pores. The authors propose that CL polymerization is a necessary step for membrane damage. They also found that CL pores can be formed by different oligomer orientations. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of CL action and identifies CL polymerization as a potential therapeutic target for treating candidiasis .'
 'Precision medicine aims to tailor treatments to individual patients based on their genetic and physiological characteristics. However, it is unclear whether the personalization process itself contributes to the effectiveness of the treatment. In this study, the authors tested whether presenting a placebo analgesia machine as personalized would improve its effectiveness. They recruited 102 adults in two samples ( N1=17 , N2=85 ) to receive painful heat stimulations on their forearm. During half of the stimulations, a machine purportedly delivered an electric current to reduce their pain. The participants were either told that the machine was personalized to their genetics and physiology or that it was effective in reducing pain generally. The authors found that participants told that the machine was personalized reported more relief in pain intensity than the control group in both the feasibility study ( standardized β=−0 . 50 [–1 . 08 , 0 . 08] ) and the pre-registered double-blind confirmatory study ( β=−0 . 20 [–0 . 36 , –0 . 04] ). The authors suggest that the personalization process itself may contribute to the effectiveness of the treatment and that this should be considered in precision medicine research and practice. This study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council ( 93188 ) and Genome Québec ( 95747 ).'
 'In the nervous system, neurons that arise from the same progenitor cell often exhibit similar patterns of connectivity. In the mouse cortex, clonally related excitatory sister neurons tend to form connections within a shared microcircuit. In contrast, clonally related sister neurons in Drosophila form distinct NotchON and NotchOFF hemilineages which innervate distinct targets and often express different neurotransmitters. Notch-differentiated clonally related sister neurons have been observed in the vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but it remains unknown whether these clonally related neurons integrate into shared circuits. In this study, the authors used an in vivo labeling approach to identify pairs of sister V2a/b neurons arising from a single progenitor in the zebrafish spinal cord. They found that although sister V2a/b neurons share anatomical characteristics, these sister neurons diverge into separate circuits, with largely distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic partners. These results suggest that Notch-differentiated clonally related neurons in vertebrate systems may integrate into distinct circuits, similar to what is observed in Drosophila.'
'Homeostatic plasticity is a mechanism that allows neuronal networks to maintain stable firing rates despite changes in synaptic drive. However, if this mechanism is activated inappropriately or excessively, it can lead to rebound hyperactivity and seizures. In this study, the authors uncovered negative regulation of cortical network homeostasis by the PARbZIP family of transcription factors. In cortical slice cultures made from knockout mice lacking all three of these factors, the network response to prolonged activity withdrawal measured with calcium imaging is much stronger, while baseline activity is unchanged. Whole-cell recordings reveal an exaggerated increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents reflecting enhanced upregulation of recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission. Genetic analyses reveal that two of the factors, Hlf and Tef, are critical for constraining plasticity and preventing life-threatening seizures. These data indicate that transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but is also involved in restraint of the response to activity deprivation. Downregulation of the strength of homeostatic plasticity could potentially provide protection against inappropriate or excessive activation of these mechanisms.'
 'The lung is a complex organ that develops from a simple bud in the embryo. The cells that make up the lung are controlled by a group of genes that work together to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Scientists have studied how these genes work together to make different types of lung cells. They have also studied how changes in the way these genes work together can lead to lung diseases. In this study, scientists used a new way to study how the genes work together in the lung. They looked at how the genes work together in cells that make up the lung and how these cells change as the lung develops. They found that a group of genes called PI3K genes are important for making different types of lung cells. They also found that changes in the way these genes work together can lead to lung diseases. This study shows how scientists can use new ways to study how genes work together to understand how the lung develops and how it can go wrong.'
 'Working memory ( WM ) is a cognitive domain that is often affected in multiple sclerosis ( MS ). The slot model of WM assumes that WM is a limited storage system for a fixed number of items, while the resource model suggests that WM is a dynamic system with a continuous allocation of resources. In this study, two continuous reproduction paradigms, memory-guided localization ( MGL ) and analog recall task with sequential presentation, were used to investigate WM dysfunction in MS. The results showed an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS. While sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy control from relapsing-remitting MS, MGL were more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes ( relapsing-remitting from secondary progressive ). Furthermore, computational modeling of the results from the sequential paradigm determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error ( mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items ) were responsible for WM dysfunction in MS. Overall, this study provided new insights into the organization of the WM system in MS population and offered a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit.'
 'Nociception is a process that animals use to detect and avoid potentially damaging stimuli. While nociception is controlled by the peripheral nervous system, the brain also plays a role in regulating nociception. Researchers have found that a neuropeptide called Drosulfakinin (DSK) is involved in nociceptive regulation in fruit flies. DSK is a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK), which is involved in nociceptive regulation in mammals. The researchers used a combination of genetic, behavioral, histological, and Ca2+ imaging analyses to identify neurons involved in DSK-mediated nociceptive regulation and to reveal a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system, raising the possibility that the descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception.'
 'Plants often produce secondary metabolites as defense mechanisms against parasites. Some fungi may be able to overcome these barriers, but only a limited number of examples and molecular mechanisms of resistance have been reported. In this study, the authors found an Aglaia plant-parasitizing fungus that overcomes the toxicity of rocaglates, which are translation inhibitors synthesized by the plant, through an amino acid substitution in a eukaryotic translation initiation factor ( eIF ) . The authors used de novo transcriptome assembly and ribosome profiling to reveal that the fungus belongs to the Ophiocordyceps genus and that its eIF4A, a molecular target of rocaglates, harbors an amino acid substitution critical for rocaglate binding. The engineered C . orbiculare showed a survival advantage on cucumber plants with rocaglates. The study exemplifies a plant–fungus tug-of-war centered on secondary metabolites produced by host plants.'
 'Psychophysical methods are widely used in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience to measure behavior and its neural correlates. They rely on controlled experiments and rigorous analysis through signal detection theory. However, they require many tedious trials and preferably highly trained participants. A recently developed approach, continuous psychophysics, promises to transform the field by abandoning the rigid trial structure involving binary responses and replacing it with continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli. However, what has precluded wide adoption of this approach is that current analysis methods do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task and therefore recover perceptual thresholds that are larger compared to equivalent traditional psychophysical experiments. Here, we introduce a computational analysis framework for continuous psychophysics based on Bayesian inverse optimal control. We show via simulations and previously published data that this not only recovers the perceptual thresholds but also estimates subjects’ action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. Taken together, we provide further evidence for the importance of including acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and, crucially, the intrinsic costs of behavior, even in experiments seemingly only investigating perception.

 'Biodiversity is essential for the provision of ecosystem services, such as food, water, and clean air. However, human activities have led to a significant decline in biodiversity, which threatens the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide. In this study, the authors developed a conceptual framework that links biodiversity dynamics to abiotic environmental changes using artificial intelligence. They applied this framework to a freshwater ecosystem, Lake Ring, in Denmark, which has experienced human impact over the past century. The authors used multilocus metabarcoding and mass spectrometry analysis to study a sedimentary archive of Lake Ring, complemented by biocides sale records and climate records. They applied explainable network models with multimodal learning to identify drivers of functional biodiversity changes across major ecosystem shifts. The authors found that insecticides and fungicides, combined with extreme temperature events and precipitation, explained up to 90% of the functional biodiversity changes. They also observed that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed over time without returning to its original state, even if the lake partially recovered in recent times. The study highlights the importance of using high-throughput systemic approaches to understand the environmental factors that cause loss of biodiversity and disrupt ecosystem functions. It also advocates the use of community-level biodiversity approaches over species-focused ecological surveys to identify the drivers of ecosystem shifts.'
 'The brain receives sensory information with a delay due to the time required for neural transmission and processing. In motion perception, the brain can overcome these delays by predictively encoding the position of moving objects using information from their past trajectories. In this study, researchers used high temporal resolution electroencephalographic data to track neural position representations of moving objects at different stages of visual processing. They found that during early stimulus-evoked activity, position representations of moving objects were activated substantially earlier than the equivalent activity evoked by unpredictable flashes, aligning the earliest representations of moving stimuli with their real-time positions. These findings indicate that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for the neural delays accumulated early in stimulus processing. However, delays still accumulate across later stages of cortical processing. The study provides direct evidence in humans that extrapolation processes allow the early visual system to localize moving objects in real time. The findings demonstrate the existence of significant predictive processing during motion perception but constrain any predictive mechanisms to acting relatively early in processing.'
'How does language experience shape the neural representation of semantic knowledge? Researchers used fMRI to compare the neural responses of two groups of deaf adults: those who acquired sign language later in life and those who acquired it from birth. The researchers found that the group who acquired sign language later in life had reduced semantic sensitivity in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL), a brain region that is thought to represent language-derived semantic knowledge. This suggests that language experience plays a role in shaping the neural representation of semantic knowledge.'
The hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory processing, and one of its key functions is the encoding and consolidation of episodic memories. Hippocampal place cells are activated in a sequential pattern during behavioral episodes, with each neuron’s activity modulated by the animal’s position within an environment. During offline periods such as sleep, place cells spontaneously reactivate, replaying the same sequential pattern previously activated during the behavioral episode. This phenomenon of neural replay is postulated to drive systems-level memory consolidation. While replay has largely been defined by the sequential reactivation of place cell ensembles driven by both where and when each place field is activated during a behavioral episode (place representation), place cells also carry additional information in the magnitude of their place field’s activity (rate representation). Reactivation events may also be capable of representing information using firing rate, but because the detection of reactivation events is based on the firing rate of place cells, it is necessary to eliminate or at least control the effects of firing rate at the point of event detection to avoid any circular reasoning. Examining whether rate modulation is reinstated during replay will help discern whether replay only represents possible transitions between adjacent locations or alternatively whether replay could serve a larger role, with the capacity to reinstate a near replica of neural activity previously driven during behavior, providing a richer, more complete memory trace.
'Mitochondria are important for many cellular processes, including spermatogenesis, the process by which sperm cells develop. However, the specific role of mitochondria in spermatogenesis is not well understood. In this study, researchers found that mice lacking a protein called PARL, which is important for mitochondrial function, developed testicular atrophy and a complete arrest of spermatogenesis. This was caused by severe mitochondrial defects and a type of cell death called ferroptosis. The researchers found that the mitochondrial defects were caused by a decrease in the expression of a protein called GPX4, which helps to prevent ferroptosis. The researchers also found that the mitochondrial defects were associated with a decrease in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q, which is important for mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that mitochondrial defects may play a role in male infertility and that ferroptosis may be involved in this process. Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms involved and to develop new treatments for male infertility.'
 'The liver is a vital organ that plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism. However, when exposed to certain conditions such as high-fat diets, the liver can become damaged and develop a condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is a serious condition that can lead to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Researchers have been looking for ways to treat NASH, and they have found that a protein called fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) may be a promising candidate. FGF21 is a hormone that is produced by the liver and helps to regulate metabolism. In this study, researchers used a mouse model of NASH to investigate the effects of FGF21 on the liver. They found that FGF21 helped to reduce liver damage and inflammation, and it also helped to prevent the development of fibrosis. The researchers believe that FGF21 could be a useful treatment for NASH, and they are planning to continue studying its effects in humans.'
 'The brain is a complex organ that is responsible for many important functions, such as thinking, feeling, and moving. To understand how the brain works, scientists use a variety of techniques to measure its activity. These techniques can be very different, and they can be used to study different parts of the brain or different behaviors. Because of this diversity, it can be difficult to compare and combine the data from different studies. To address this problem, a team of scientists has developed a new language for describing neurophysiology data. This language, called Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), allows scientists to describe their data in a way that is standardized and easy to understand. NWB also makes it possible to combine data from different studies and to share data with other scientists. This new language is already being used by many scientists, and it is expected to continue to grow and improve in the future. '
 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common cause of respiratory illnesses, including the flu. In some cases, IAV infections can lead to long-lasting neurological disturbances, such as encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. To better understand the mechanisms behind these long-lasting changes, researchers used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze the hypothalamus of mice infected with H1N1 IAV. They found that all cell types in the hypothalamus were affected by the infection, with the most pronounced changes occurring at 3 days past infection. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, showed increased activity in response to the infection, while neurons showed reduced activity in mitochondria and protein translation. These changes might be a preventive mechanism to avoid intracellular viral replication and attack by phagocytosing cells. The change in microglia activity suggests that this is complemented by a shift in microglia activity to provide increased surveillance of their surroundings. These findings provide new insights into the neurological effects of IAV infections and may help to develop new treatments for these conditions.'
 'In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the gene expression changes that occur in Drosophila follicle cells when apical-basal cell polarity is disrupted. They found that cells with disrupted polarity had distinct gene expression patterns and that these patterns were associated with changes in cell behavior. The authors also identified a role for the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway in regulating the behavior of these cells. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying cell plasticity and tumorigenesis.'
 'Humans learn about the environment either directly by interacting with it or indirectly by seeking information about it from social sources such as conspecifics . The degree of confidence in the information obtained through either route should determine the impact that it has on adapting and changing behavior . We examined whether and how behavioral and neural computations differ during non-social learning as opposed to learning from social sources . Trial-wise confidence judgments about non-social and social information sources offered a window into this learning process . Despite matching exactly the statistical features of social and non-social conditions, confidence judgments were more accurate and less changeable when they were made about social as opposed to non-social information sources . In addition to subjective reports of confidence, differences were also apparent in the Bayesian estimates of participants’ subjective beliefs . Univariate activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction more closely tracked confidence about social as opposed to non-social information sources. In addition, the multivariate patterns of activity in the same areas encoded identities of social information sources compared to non-social information sources. ', Keyword: '['neuroscience']'
 'Synaptic communication involves the fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, which leads to neurotransmitter release. This process is triggered by brief and local elevations of intracellular Ca2+ with remarkably high sensitivity. How this sensitivity is achieved at the molecular level is unknown. Synaptotagmins are proteins that confer the Ca2+ sensitivity of neurotransmitter exocytosis. Biochemical measurements have shown that synaptotagmin's Ca2+ affinity is too low to account for synaptic function. However, synaptotagmin's Ca2+ affinity increases upon binding the plasma membrane phospholipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2, and vice versa, Ca2+ binding increases synaptotagmin's PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 affinity, indicating a stabilization of the Ca2+/PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dual-bound state. Here, the authors devise a molecular exocytosis model based on this positive allosteric stabilization and the assumptions that ( 1 . ) synaptotagmin Ca2+/PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dual binding lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion and that ( 2 . ) the effect of multiple synaptotagmins on the energy barrier is additive. The model, which relies on biochemically measured Ca2+/PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 affinities and protein copy numbers, reproduced the steep Ca2+ dependency of neurotransmitter release. The authors conclude that allosterically stabilized Ca2+/PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dual binding enables synaptotagmins to exert their cooperative control of neurotransmitter release.'
 'Sauropterygia was a diverse group of marine reptiles that lived from the Early Triassic to the Late Cretaceous. They are traditionally divided into two groups: short-necked, durophagous Placodontia and long-necked Eosauropterygia. Saurosphargids, a small clade of armored marine reptiles, are generally considered as the sauropterygian sister-group. However, the early evolutionary history of sauropterygians and their phylogenetic relationships with other diapsid reptiles are still incompletely understood. In this study, the authors report a new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic of South China, representing the earliest known occurrence of the clade. An updated phylogenetic analysis focusing on the interrelationships among diapsid reptiles recovers saurosphargids as nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. Furthermore, the phylogenetic position of several Early and Middle Triassic sauropterygians of previously uncertain phylogenetic affinity, such as Atopodentatus, Hanosaurus, Majiashanosaurus, and Corosaurus, is clarified, elucidating the early evolutionary assembly of the sauropterygian body plan. The authors' phylogenetic analysis supports the placement of Testudines and Archosauromorpha within Archelosauria, a result strongly corroborated by molecular data but only recently recovered in a phylogenetic analysis using a morphology-only dataset. Their study provides evidence for the rapid diversification of sauropterygians in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event and emphasizes the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa.'
 'Smoking is a major public health concern worldwide. It is associated with a wide range of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses. Smoking also has an impact on DNA methylation, which is a process that regulates gene expression. DNA methylation patterns can be influenced by environmental factors, such as smoking. In this study, the authors used data from a large cohort of monozygotic twins to investigate the relationship between smoking and DNA methylation. They found that DNA methylation patterns are reactive to smoking, and that these patterns can be reversed upon quitting smoking. The authors also found that smoking-reactive DNA methylation patterns are enriched in genes associated with smoking-related diseases. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of smoking on DNA methylation and health outcomes.'
'The retina is a complex organ that processes visual information before it is sent to the brain. Researchers have studied the retina extensively in isolated, ex vivo preparations. However, it is difficult to study the retina in its natural, awake state. To address this, researchers recorded the activity of retinal ganglion cells in the optic tract of head-fixed mice. They found that awake retinal output had faster kinetics, a larger dynamic range, and higher firing activity than anesthetized or ex vivo retinal output. These results suggest that the retina may employ dense coding principles in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as has been often assumed from ex vivo studies.'
'Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) is a common technique used in many biological studies to preserve biomolecular interactions in vivo . However, recent studies have shown that PFA fixation can alter the appearance of liquid–liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) in living cells . In this study, the authors compared images of cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins before and after fixation and found that fixation can either enhance or diminish the appearance of LLPS in vivo . The authors also found that fixation can cause droplet-like puncta to artificially appear in cells that have a homogeneous protein distribution and no detectable puncta in the live condition . The authors used live-cell single-molecule imaging and simulations based on a kinetic model to further investigate the effects of fixation on protein localization in fixed cells. They found that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein–protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and the difference between protein fixation rates in and out of droplet-like puncta. The authors conclude that their work urges caution in the interpretation of previous claims of in vivo phase separation based solely on immunofluorescence imaging of fixed cells and serves to guide future judicious application of PFA fixation.'
 'Uropathogenic Escherichia coli ( UPEC ) are bacteria that cause urinary tract infections ( UTIs ). These bacteria can form intracellular bacterial communities ( IBCs ) within the bladder cells of humans. IBCs are thought to be a key factor in the recurrence of UTIs. However, it is difficult to study the dynamic responses of IBCs to host stresses and antibiotic therapy in situ. To address this issue, a human bladder-chip model was developed. This model uses time-lapse microscopy to show that rapid recruitment of neutrophils from the vascular channel to sites of infection leads to swarm and neutrophil extracellular trap formation but does not prevent IBC formation. Subsequently, the researchers tracked bacterial growth dynamics in individual IBCs through two cycles of antibiotic administration interspersed with recovery periods. They found that the elimination of bacteria within IBCs by the antibiotic was delayed, and in some instances, did not occur at all. During the recovery period, rapid proliferation in a significant fraction of IBCs reseeded new foci of infection through bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation. These insights reinforce a dynamic role for IBCs as harbors of bacterial persistence, with significant consequences for non-compliance with antibiotic regimens.'
 'Ammonium is an essential element for life, as it is used to build proteins and nucleic acids. In order to study the flexibility of the metabolic network that assimilates ammonium, the authors constructed an Escherichia coli strain that is auxotrophic for glutamate. This allowed them to systematically investigate which amino acids could serve as amine sources to complement the auxotrophy. The authors found that several amino acids could complement the auxotrophy either by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. In this network, the authors identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, the authors extended the transamination network by the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources and identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Finally, the authors introduced ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine as alternative entry points for ammonium. Their study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.'
'Coral reefs are home to a diverse array of organisms, including symbiotic algae called Symbiodiniaceae. These algae live inside the coral cells and provide them with photosynthetically fixed carbon. However, it is not clear how this carbon is released from the algae for uptake by the coral. In this study, the authors investigated the release of carbon from the algae Breviolum sp. in response to changes in pH. They found that decreases in pH accelerated the release of monosaccharides, such as glucose and galactose, into the environment. This was due to the deformation of the cell surface structures and the upregulation of genes related to cellulase in the algae. The authors suggest that low pH signals the cellulase-mediated release of monosaccharides from the algal cell wall as an environmental response in coral reef ecosystems. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of carbon transfer from symbiotic algae to coral hosts.'
 'Nephronophthisis ( NPHP ) is a rare genetic disorder that causes cysts to form in the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure. The disease is caused by mutations in genes that are important for the development of the kidneys. One of these genes is INVS, which is important for the development of cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that line the surface of many cells. In mice, when INVS is removed, the kidneys develop cysts and become fibrotic. To understand the role of INVS in the development of NPHP, researchers created mice where INVS was removed from either the kidney epithelial cells or the stromal cells. They found that the kidneys of the mice where INVS was removed from the epithelial cells developed cysts and became fibrotic, while the kidneys of the mice where INVS was removed from the stromal cells did not develop cysts or become fibrotic. The researchers also found that removing cilia from the kidney epithelial cells partially suppressed the development of cysts and fibrosis in the INVS mutant mice. Finally, the researchers found that treating the INVS mutant mice with a drug called valproic acid ( VPA ) reduced cell proliferation, cyst expansion, and preserved kidney function. These findings suggest that VPA could be a potential treatment for NPHP.'
 'The extinct Steller’s sea cow ( Hydrodamalis gigas; †1768 ) was a whale-sized marine mammal that lived in the harsh coastal climate of the North Pacific. Researchers used next-generation DNA sequencing data to estimate the number of copies of mitochondrial DNA in tumor cells and the adjacent normal tissue of 22 different types of cancer. They found that in many types of cancer, tumor cells have fewer copies of mitochondrial DNA than the cells that make up normal tissue. This depletion of mitochondrial DNA was accompanied by a reduction of the expression of mitochondrial genes, suggesting that mitochondrial activity may be subverted and altered in these tumor types. The researchers also found that the number of copies of mitochondrial DNA in certain tumor types is related to the incidence of key 'driver' mutations that cause cells to become cancerous. This knowledge may help to develop new treatments for these tumors.'
 'Expression of activated RasV12 provides Drosophila cultured cells with a proliferation and survival advantage that simplifies the generation of continuous cell lines. Here, the authors used lineage-restricted RasV12 expression to generate continuous cell lines of muscle, glial, and epithelial cell type. Additionally, cell lines with neuronal and hemocyte characteristics were isolated by cloning from cell cultures established with broad RasV12 expression. Differentiation with the hormone ecdysone caused maturation of cells from mesoderm lines into active muscle tissue and enhanced dendritic features in neuronal-like lines. Transcriptome analysis showed expression of key cell-type-specific genes and the expected alignment with single-cell sequencing and in situ data. Overall, the technique has produced in vitro cell models with characteristics of glia, epithelium, muscle, nerve, and hemocyte. The cells and associated data are available from the Drosophila Genomic Resource Center.'
 'Multiciliated cells ( MCCs ) are specialized epithelial cells that line the surface of the respiratory tract, brain ventricles, and reproductive systems. These cells contain tens to hundreds of motile cilia that collectively beat to drive fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. To template these cilia, MCCs assemble multiple motile cilia using a process called centriole amplification. In this process, MCCs dramatically expand their centriole content during a process known as centriole amplification. In cycling cells, the master regulator of centriole assembly Polo-like kinase 4 ( PLK4 ) is essential for centriole duplication; however, recent work has questioned the role of PLK4 in centriole assembly in MCCs. To address this discrepancy, researchers created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Tracheal epithelial cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results show that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs and suggest that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of centriole amplification in MCCs and may have implications for the treatment of diseases caused by defects in motile cilia assembly or function.'
 'The human endometrium is a complex tissue that undergoes repetitive cycles of tissue wounding and repair. The process of endometrial repair is not well understood, but it is known to involve the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelial cell layer. In this study, the authors used a mouse model of endometrial repair to investigate the origins of the cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium. They used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. The authors then used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts (PDGFRa+) and stromal perivascular cells (NG2/CSPG4+). They demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transition and become incorporated into the re-epithelialized luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons both to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response and to other mucosal tissues which have a variable response to wounding.'
 'Microbes often exist in complex communities where productivity and resilience rely on population diversity. This diversity can be achieved through genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can increase the fitness of a population by contributing to the division of labor or it can serve as a bet-hedging strategy to increase the odds of population survival when alteration of environmental conditions occur quickly. A common facilitator of phenotypic heterogeneity is phase variation, in which reversible genetic alterations occur that function as ‘ON/OFF’ switches that control specific phenotypes. One common generator of phenotypic heterogeneity is recombinase-mediated, site-specific recombination, such as invertible switches and transposable elements, which can influence the expression of coding sequences by altering the orientation of promoters or introducing new regulatory sequences, respectively. Phenotypic heterogeneity within a population can also be achieved by recombination between homologous sequences at different genomic loci, a phenomenon referred to as unequal or non-allelic recombination. The DNA repair and maintenance recombinase, RecA, identifies homologous sequences and catalyzes strand exchange which, when unequal homologous sequences are recombined, leads to modifications in genomic architecture through sequence inversions, deletions, or duplications. These adjustments to genome architecture can similarly influence the orientation of promoters through sequence inversion, but also change copy number of genes by deleting and duplicating intervening sequences. Changes in gene copy number can impact protein production, and thus cell phenotypes – a phenomenon referred to as gene dosage effects. In this study, the authors identified a phase variation system in Burkholderia thailandensis that generates a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous population. Genetic analyses revealed that RecA-mediated homologous recombination between a pair of insertion sequence (IS) 2-like elements duplicates a 208.6 kb region of DNA that contains 157 coding sequences. RecA-mediated homologous recombination also resolves merodiploids, and hence copy number of the region is varied and dynamic within populations. The presence of two or more copies of the region is advantageous for growth in a biofilm, and a single copy is advantageous during planktonic growth. While IS elements are well known to contribute to evolution through gene inactivation, polar effects on downstream genes, and altering genomic architecture, the authors believe that this system represents a rare example of IS element-mediated evolution in which the IS elements provide homologous sequences for amplification of a chromosomal region that provides a selective advantage under specific growth conditions, thereby expanding the lifestyle repertoire of the species.'
 'In bacteria, the rate and accuracy of translation is determined by multiple components, including tRNA pools, tRNA modifying enzymes, and rRNA molecules. These components are often redundant in terms of gene copy number or function. The authors of this study manipulated the redundancy of these components in Escherichia coli by deleting 28 tRNA genes, 3 tRNA modifying systems, and 4 rRNA operons in various combinations. They found that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful and costly under nutrient limitation. This nutrient-dependent cost of redundant tRNA genes stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. Importantly, these effects are also contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing. Overall, the results of this study indicate both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species’ evolutionary history with feasts and famines.'
'The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a massive amount of genomic data being collected from around the world. This data is typically stored in databases and can be analyzed using various tools. However, these tools can be limited in their ability to handle the sheer volume of data. To address this issue, researchers have developed a new tool called Taxonium, which allows for the exploration of large phylogenetic trees in the browser. Taxonium can display trees with millions of nodes and allows for the exploration of mutations and associated metadata. The tool can be run locally in the browser, from a server-based backend, or as a desktop application. The authors describe how Taxonium can be used to analyze a tree of five million sequences and provide insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. They also provide a tool at cov2tree.org for exploring a public tree of more than five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Taxonium can be applied to any tree and is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium. The authors highlight the importance of having tools that can handle large datasets and the potential for Taxonium to be used in a variety of fields, including evolutionary biology and epidemiology.

'RNA molecules are localized to specific subcellular regions through interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) . Generally, our knowledge of the mechanistic details behind the localization of a given RNA is restricted to a particular cell type . Here, we show that RNA/RBP interactions that regulate RNA localization in one cell type predictably regulate localization in other cell types with vastly different morphologies . To determine transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells, we used our recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique, Halo-seq. We found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins ( RP mRNAs ) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. Using reporter transcripts and single-molecule RNA FISH, we found that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5′ UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. In both cell types, the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the 5′ UTR of the transcript, was abolished upon perturbation of the RNA-binding protein LARP1, and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-1. To extend these findings, we compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells. We found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator, and demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms cut across cell morphologies.
 'Aging is a complex process that affects many cellular processes. One of the hallmarks of aging is an increase in transcriptional noise, which refers to the variation in gene expression among cells that are supposed to be identical. However, the methods used to measure transcriptional noise have varied widely, making it difficult to compare results across studies. In this study, the authors developed a Python toolkit called Decibel that implements four commonly used methods for measuring transcriptional noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. They also developed a new method called Scallop that measures the membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. The authors applied these methods to seven aging datasets from different tissues and species and found that the increase in transcriptional noise associated with aging was not universal. Instead, they found that age-associated changes in cell type composition were more consistent across datasets. The authors suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated and that further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of age-associated changes in cellular identity.'
 'Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment due to the presence of drug-resistant clonal lineages. However, identifying the characteristics of such lineages that underpin resistance to therapy has remained challenging. Here, the authors used clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq, a platform for lineage tracing at the single-cell transcriptomic level, to understand response and resistance to therapy, including BET bromodomain inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy, in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These analyses revealed oxidative stress protection by NRF2 as a major mechanism of taxane resistance and led to the discovery that their tumor models are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation therapy using the clinical stage drug L-asparaginase after frontline treatment with docetaxel. In summary, clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq identifies mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy that are also operative in patients and pinpoints asparagine bioavailability as a druggable vulnerability of taxane-resistant lineages. ', Introduction: 'Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) is thought to underlie tumor progression and resistance to therapy by providing a reservoir of phenotypically diverse clonal lineages on which selective pressures from the microenvironment or therapeutic intervention exert their effects. Inference of clonal composition from bulk sequencing has elucidated the breadth of ITH across tumor types and suggests that often rare pre-existing clones can resist therapy-induced killing to drive relapse. However, such methods are limited by their inability to characterize such resistant clones beyond genotype and how their properties change over time and in response to therapy. Recently, several lineage tracing approaches have emerged that are able to link clonal identity with gene expression by utilizing expressed genetic barcodes that are read-out by single-cell RNA sequencing. These powerful methods allow deconvolution of complex mixtures of clones while simultaneously providing a gene expression profile of those cells that can indicate the pathways on which they depend. However, to date in solid tumors, these technologies have mostly been used to study drug response in vitro or metastatic dissemination in vivo and have not been utilized to study therapeutic response in immune-competent models. A thorough understanding of the biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy is essential if we are to improve patient outcomes. Most existing combination cancer therapies are not rationally designed but were instead empirically optimized to avoid overlapping toxicities. More recently, alternative therapeutic strategies have emerged including synthetic lethality, drug synergy, and collateral sensitivity that aim to leverage selective vulnerabilities of tumor cells while minimizing toxicity. Of particular promise is collateral sensitivity, in which as a tumor becomes resistant to one drug, it comes at the cost of sensitivity to a second drug. Since many modern clinical trials occur in the context of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, the identification of frontline therapy-induced collateral sensitivities to second-line therapy would have the potential to be rapidly translated into improved outcomes for patients. Here, we describe WILD-seq (Wholistic Interrogation of Lineage Dynamics by sequencing), an accessible and adaptable platform for lineage tracing at the single-cell transcriptomic level that facilitates in vivo analysis of clonal dynamics and apply it to the study of syngeneic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models. Our optimized pipeline ensures recurrent representation of clonal lineages across animals and samples, facilitating analysis of clonal dynamics under the selective pressure of therapeutic intervention. Importantly, analysis of response of TNBC models to frontline taxane-based chemotherapy revealed an enrichment of clones with high levels of NRF2 signaling, implicating defense against oxidative damage as a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. Building on the work of others, we show that these NRF2-high, taxane-resistant lineages are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation as a result of L-asparaginase treatment and that they adapt to this second-line intervention by up-regulating de novo asparagine synthesis by increasing asparagine synthetase (Asns) expression. Together these data indicate that high levels of NRF2 signaling, which is also observed in patients following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, promote both resistance to chemotherapy and sensitivity to asparagine deprivation and warrant the exploration of L-asparaginase as a therapeutic modality
'DMRT1 is a gene that is important for testis development in many species of vertebrates, including mammals. However, its role in mammalian testis development is not well understood. In this study, the authors used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a DMRT1 knockout rabbit model. They found that DMRT1 is required for testis development in rabbits, as XY DMRT1 knockout rabbits showed early male-to-female sex reversal with differentiating ovaries and complete female genitalia. However, germ cells failed to undergo meiosis, and follicles did not form in XY and XX DMRT1 knockout mutant ovaries, leading to female infertility. The authors also found that DMRT1 is a testis-determining factor in mammals and that it is required for female fertility. These findings provide new insights into the role of DMRT1 in mammalian testis development and its importance for both male and female fertility.'
'Obesity is a complex disease that results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Drosophila has emerged as a useful model for studying obesity and its related diseases. CTPS is an important enzyme for the de novo synthesis of CTP, which governs the cellular level of CTP and the rate of phospholipid synthesis. CTPS forms filamentous structures called cytoophidia, which are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Our study demonstrates that CTPS is crucial in regulating body weight and starvation resistance in Drosophila by functioning in the fat body. HFD-induced obesity leads to increased transcription of CTPS and elongates cytoophidia in larval adipocytes. Depleting CTPS in the fat body prevents HFD-induced obesity, including body weight gain, adipocyte expansion, and lipid accumulation, by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis. These findings not only establish a functional link between CTPS and lipid homeostasis but also highlight the potential role of CTPS manipulation in the treatment of HFD-induced obesity.

 'During embryogenesis, cells communicate with each other through signaling pathways that control cell fate and behavior. One such pathway is the Nodal signaling pathway, which is important for the formation of the germ layers during early embryonic development. In this study, the authors investigated the role of different receptors in the Nodal signaling pathway during zebrafish embryogenesis. They found that the Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b are the main mediators of Nodal signaling in zebrafish, and that they can directly influence the distribution of Nodal in the embryo. The authors also found that the Type II receptors Acvr2a and Acvr2b are involved in Nodal signaling, but that their role is partly independent of Nodal signaling itself. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of Nodal signaling during early embryonic development.'
 'Type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated antiviral responses are crucial for host defense against viral infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of IFN-I production are not well understood. In this study, the authors used a murine fibroblast reporter model to investigate the influence of various stochastic and deterministic host-intrinsic factors on dictating early IFN-I responses. They found that epigenetic drugs influenced the percentage of responding cells, and that there was transient heritability driving responder fates, which was verified with mathematical modeling. Additionally, the authors found that cell density played a significant role in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying early IFN-I responses and may lead to improved IFN-mediated immune therapies.'
 'Microtubules (MTs) are built from α-/β-tubulin dimers and used as tracks by kinesin and dynein motors to transport a variety of cargos, such as mRNAs, proteins, and organelles, within the cell. Tubulins are subjected to several post-translational modifications (PTMs), including glutamylation, which adds one or more glutamic acid residues as branched peptide chains to the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin. In this study, the authors found that in Drosophila ovaries, glutamylation of α-tubulin isotypes occurred clearly on the C-terminal ends of αTub84B/D, but not on αTub67C. The C-terminal ends of αTub84B/D are glutamylated at several glutamyl sidechains in various combinations. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian αTub84B/D and with this for the proper localization of glutamylated microtubules. The normal distribution of kinesin-1 in the germline relies on TTLL5, and two kinesin-1-dependent processes, the precise localization of Staufen and the fast, bidirectional ooplasmic streaming, depend on TTLL5, too, suggesting a causative pathway. In the nervous system, a mutation of TTLL5 that inactivates its enzymatic activity decreases the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria. The authors' results demonstrate in vivo roles of TTLL5 in differential glutamylation of α-tubulins and point to the in vivo importance of α-tubulin glutamylation for cellular functions involving microtubule transport.'
 'The study of genomes has provided valuable insights into the evolution of species and their traits. However, the complexity of genomes can make it difficult to draw conclusions about the evolution of genes and chromosomes. To address this challenge, a new tool called GENESPACE has been developed. This tool uses conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. This allows researchers to study the evolution of genes and chromosomes in more detail. The tool has been used to study the evolution of sex chromosomes in vertebrates, the diversity of grasses, and the variation among different maize cultivars. The tool provides a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in complex genomes. It can be used to study the evolution of genes and chromosomes in a wide range of species.'
 'Most bacteria exist and interact within polymicrobial communities. These interactions produce unique compounds, increase virulence, and augment antibiotic resistance. One community associated with negative healthcare outcomes consists of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. When co-cultured, virulence factors secreted by P. aeruginosa reduce metabolism and growth in S. aureus. When grown in vitro, this allows P. aeruginosa to drive S. aureus toward extinction. However, when found in vivo, both species can co-exist. Previous work has noted that this may be due to altered gene expression or mutations. However, little is known about how the growth environment could influence the co-existence of both species. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation, we show that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. We found that changing the carbon source in growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric we call absolute growth. We found that as a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture. This is due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. Finally, we show that the relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. Our results demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature, provides support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations. Our findings have implications for the bottom-up design of polymicrobial communities and may lead to novel treatment strategies in the clinic.'
 'The quantity and complexity of data being generated and published in biology has increased substantially, but few methods exist for capturing knowledge about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions between diverse groups of species in a way that is amenable to data-driven biology and research. To improve access to this knowledge, the authors have constructed a framework for the curation of the scientific literature studying interspecies interactions, using data curated for the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base) as a case study. The framework provides a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen–host interaction data at the level of the host, pathogen, strain, gene, and genotype. The concept of a multispecies genotype, the ‘metagenotype,’ is introduced to facilitate capturing changes in the disease-causing abilities of pathogens and host resistance or susceptibility observed by gene alterations. The authors report on this framework and describe PHI-Canto, a community curation tool for use by publication authors. The framework and PHI-Canto can be used to capture knowledge about interspecies interactions in a standardized and machine-readable format, making it easier to find and use this information in data-driven biology and research.'
 'Sequence variation in enhancers that control cell-type-specific gene transcription contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations . However, it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers in their native genomic context . Using F1-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice, researchers identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. They found that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. The study also found that anesthetic drug propofol may induce sleep-like patterns of electrical activity in the human brain by affecting the levels of all three of the neuromodulators. More studies are needed to look at how the networks of cells in the cortex and thalamus communicate with the brainstem, and how changes in the levels of neuromodulators affect memory and learning.'
'Viruses interact with the intracellular transport machinery to promote viral replication . Such host–virus interactions can either benefit the host ( e . g . , immune recognition ) or the virus ( e . g . , viral co-option of host machinery or viral antagonism of host immunity ) and are thus critical determinants of the outcome of a viral infection . Competing genetic innovations on both sides of these host–virus conflicts result in signatures of recurrent adaptation that have been described as molecular ‘arms races’ ( Daugherty and Malik , 2012; Duggal and Emerman , 2012; Tenthorey et al . , 2022 ) . Indeed , many host antiviral factors that directly interact with viral proteins display signatures of recurrent positive ( diversifying ) selection over evolutionary time , and genetic variation in these host–virus interactions shapes species-specific susceptibility to circulating and emerging pathogens ( Daugherty and Malik , 2012; Duggal and Emerman , 2012; Tenthorey et al . , 2022; Meyerson and Sawyer , 2011; Rothenburg and Brennan , 2020 ) . These data suggest that there is great potential to use evolutionary signatures of rapid evolution not only as an approach to more deeply understand known host–virus conflicts but also as a means to discover new proteins engaged in viral interactions ( Daugherty and Malik , 2012 ) . Compellingly , it is estimated that around 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in humans result from viral selective pressure ( Enard et al . , 2016; Enard and Petrov , 2018 ) , suggesting that many host–virus conflicts remain undescribed . One potential source of host–virus conflicts is over the active transport of macromolecules within the cell . The relatively large size of eukaryotic cells , coupled with the density of macromolecules in the cytoplasm , limits the effectiveness of diffusion to localize and transport large intracellular cargos , such as organelles , membrane vesicles , RNAs , and protein complexes ( Luby-Phelps , 2000; Seksek et al . , 1997 ) . Eukaryotic cells overcome this problem by actively transporting large intracellular cargos using dynein and kinesin motors , which move on microtubules in opposite directions . Aspects of viral infection , viral replication , and the host immune response all require microtubule-based transport . For example , viruses co-opt the microtubule cytoskeleton for cell entry , transport of viral components to sites of replication , remodeling of cellular compartments , and viral egress ( Brandenburg and Zhuang , 2007; Dodding and Way , 2011; Döhner et al . , 2005; Radtke et al . , 2006 ) . Similarly , in response to infection , the host adaptive and innate immune response require movement of signaling components , transport of endocytic and exocytic vesicles , organelle recycling , and cellular remodeling , all of which require the microtubule-based trafficking machinery ( Ilan-Ber and Ilan , 2019; Kast and Dominguez , 2017; Man and Kanneganti , 2016; Mostowy and Shenoy , 2015 ) . Despite the clear role of microtubule-based transport in both aiding and inhibiting viral replication , the degree to which host–virus genetic conflicts shape the basic biology of this machinery is poorly understood . To uncover the role of this machinery in viral replication and the immune response , we set out to determine whether there were undescribed genetic conflicts between viruses and the intracellular transport machinery . Specifically , we focused on the dynein transport machinery , which traffics dozens of cellular cargos towards microtubule minus-ends ( generally anchored to centrosomes near the nucleus ) . In human cells , only one dynein motor-containing gene , cytoplasmic dynein-1 ( DYNC1H1 ) , is responsible for long-distance transport in the cytoplasm . However , the active cytoplasmic dynein-1 complex ( hereafter
 'Actin is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in the organization of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. Actin isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner and have different biochemical properties and functions. The structures of actin isoforms have been studied extensively, but the differences between isoforms have not been fully understood. In this study, the authors report the high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle α-actin, cardiac muscle α-actin, ß-actin, and γ-actin in the Mg2+·ADP state with their native post-translational modifications. The structures revealed isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus that shift closer to the filament surface upon myosin binding, thereby establishing isoform-specific interfaces. The authors conclude that the structures of single-isotype, post-translationally modified bare skeletal muscle α-actin, cardiac muscle α-actin, ß-actin, and γ-actin reveal general principles, similarities, and differences between isoforms. The structures complement the repertoire of known actin structures and allow for a comprehensive understanding of in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms.'
 'Transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences' (TARDIS) is a new approach to large-scale transgenesis that overcomes typical limitations encountered in multicellular systems. TARDIS splits the transgenesis process into two steps: creation of individuals carrying experimentally introduced sequence libraries, followed by inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components into engineered genomic sites. This system increases transformation yields up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods. TARDIS has been demonstrated in Caenorhabditis elegans, where it has been used to generate (1) a large set of individually barcoded lineages and (2) transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries. The system is adaptable for any situation where the sequences for integration can be introduced with high diversity and heritability, and where a genomic site for integration can be made or is available. TARDIS has the potential to expand the impact of exploratory transgenesis in functional domains that are difficult to replicate in single-cell models.
 'The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in an asymmetric bilayer with embedded lipoproteins and transmembrane β-barrel proteins ( OMPs ). These proteins play vital functional roles, e.g., exchanging small molecules with the environment through their transmembrane β-barrel porins. The translocation and folding of OMPs involve many proteins, including essential and auxiliary ones that form multiple complexes in cooperation. To investigate these biological pathways, we used a deep learning pipeline called AF2Complex to identify PPIs within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and applied it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, we found not only expected interactions but also unexpected ones with profound implications. Subsequently, we predicted atomic structures for these protein complexes. These structures, typically of high confidence, explained experimental observations and led to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent, precursor OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to a β-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways by using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.'
'Dopamine (DA) neurons are important for regulating movement and motivation. These neurons release DA in the brain, which affects how we move and feel. The axons of these neurons are complex, with many different release sites. It is not known how these release sites are regulated. Neuroligins (NLs) are proteins that help regulate the connections between neurons. They have been shown to regulate the connections between DA neurons and other neurons in the brain. Neurexins (Nrxns) are proteins that NLs interact with. It is not known if Nrxns regulate DA neuron function. To test this, researchers deleted Nrxns from DA neurons in mice. They found that these mice had impaired movement and DA signaling. They also found that GABA, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate movement and feeling, was released more from DA neurons in the brain. This suggests that Nrxns regulate the connections between DA neurons and other neurons in the brain, and that this affects how we move and feel.'
'The use of mobile phones for healthcare purposes, known as mobile health (mHealth), is being investigated in Africa. We found that 82% of individuals in 33 African countries own mobile phones, with 42% owning basic phones and 40% owning smartphones. People who live close to a health clinic are more likely to own a mobile phone. Men, urban residents, and those aged 26–40 are more likely to own a smartphone. There are inequalities in mobile phone ownership based on gender, urban-rural residency, age, and poverty. If mHealth interventions are to be rolled out in Africa, they must be designed to address these inequalities.'
 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) antibody levels can be used to assess humoral immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, and may predict risk of future infection. Higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike antibodies are known to be associated with increased protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, variation in antibody levels and risk factors for lower antibody levels following each round of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have not been explored across a wide range of socio-demographic, SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, and health factors within population-based cohorts. Samples were collected from 9361 individuals from TwinsUK and ALSPAC UK population-based longitudinal studies and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Cross-sectional sampling was undertaken in April-May 2021 ( TwinsUK, N=4256; ALSPAC, N=4622 ) and in TwinsUK only in November 2021-January 2022 ( N=3575 ). Variation in antibody levels after first, second, and third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with health, socio-demographic, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination variables were analysed. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we tested associations between antibody levels following vaccination and: ( 1 ) SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination ( s ) ; ( 2 ) health, socio-demographic, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination variables. Within TwinsUK, single-vaccinated individuals with the lowest 20% of anti-Spike antibody levels at initial testing had threefold greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next 6–9 months ( OR = 2.9 , 95% CI: 1.4 , 6.0 ) , compared to the top 20%. In TwinsUK and ALSPAC, individuals identified as at increased risk of COVID-19 complication through the UK ‘Shielded Patient List’ had consistently greater odds ( two- to fourfold ) of having antibody levels in the lowest 10%. Third vaccination increased absolute antibody levels for almost all individuals, and reduced relative disparities compared with earlier vaccinations. These findings quantify the association between antibody level and risk of subsequent infection, and support a policy of triple vaccination for the generation of protective antibodies. Antibody testing was funded by UK Health Security Agency.
