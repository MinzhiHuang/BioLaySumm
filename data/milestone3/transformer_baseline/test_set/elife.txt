a membrane bound membrane bound acyltransferase-3 ( AT3 ) domain ( PF01757 ) is a protein that can be catalysed by proteins with a bacterial acetyl transmembrane helices arranged to form a large cytoplasmic cavity lined by residues known to be essential for function . the resulting structure exhibited a novel fold for the AT3 domain , which molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated is stable in the membrane . in this study , evolutionary co-variance analysis was used to build a computational model of the structure of an bacterial O-antigen modifying acetic modifying protein , OafB . this new general model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could abrogate critical functions of bacterial pathogens .
honey bee ecology demands they make both rapid and accurate assessments of which flowers are most likely to offer them nectar or pollen . we examined their speed and accuracy of both flower acceptance and rejection decisions . We used a controlled flight arena that varied both the likelihood of a stimulus offering reward and punishment and the quality of evidence for stimuli . their decisions were sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence . Acceptance responses had higher accuracy than rejection responses and were more sensitive to changes in available evidence and reward likelihood .
biguanides , including the world’s most prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes , metformin , not only lower blood sugar , but also promote longevity in preclinical models . despite this promise , the full spectrum of molecular effectors responsible for these health benefits remains elusive . through unbiased screening in Caenorhabditis elegans , we uncovered a role for genes necessary for ether lipid biosynthesis in the favorable effects of biguansides .
bacterial relationships between bacteria mediate the services that gut microbiomes provide to their hosts . knowing the overall direction and strength of these relationships is essential to learn how ecology scales up to affect microbiome assembly , dynamics , and host health is debated . here , we apply a robust , multinomial logistic-normal modeling framework to extensive time series data ( 5534 samples from 56 baboon hosts over 13 years ) to infer thousands of correlations in bacterial abundance in individual hosts and test the degree to which these correlations are ‘universal’ . we find that most bacterial correlation patterns are weak , negative , or universal across hosts , such that shared correlation patterns dominate over host-specific correlations by almost twofold . further , taxon pairs that had inconsistent correlation signs ( either positive or negative ) in different hosts always had weak correlations within hosts ; however , shared correlation pattern dominates over host -specific correlations by nearly twofold
gamma oscillations are believed to underlie cognitive processes by shaping the formation of transient neuronal partnerships on a millisecond scale . they are coupled to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas , possibly reflecting local computations driven by sensory inputs sampled at each breath . here , we investigated the mechanisms and functions of gammas in the piriform ( olfactory ) cortex of awake mice to understand their dependence on breathing and how they relate to local spiking activity .
asynchronous replication of chromosome domains during S phase is essential for eukaryotic genome function , but the mechanisms establishing which domains replicate early versus late in different cell types remain incompletely understood . here , we developed a novel method termed MS-Enabled Rapid protein Complex Identification ( MERCI ) to isolate a stable stoichiometric native complex SUMM4 that comprises SUUR and a chromatin boundary protein Mod ( mdg4 ) -67 . we found that a SNF2 family ATP-dependent motor protein uMM4 can impart late replication of intercalary heterochromatin by attenuating the progression of replication forks through euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries , and uncover a critical role for architectural proteins in replication control .
background : biological age in adults is often understood as representing general health and resilience , but the conceptual interpretation of accelerated biological age is unclear.objectives:we aimed to clarify the relationship between biological age and child developmental outcomes , including growth and adiposity , cognition , behavior , lung function and the onset of puberty , among European school-age children participating in the HELIX exposome cohort.materials and methods : the study population included up to 1173 children , aged between 5 and 12 years , from study centres in the UK , France , Spain , Norway , Lithuania , and Greece.results:there were no significant association between telomere length and DNA methylation age and two novel candidate biological age indicators , with child developmental measures as well as health risk factors . accelerated immunometabolic age was associated with better working memory ( p=4 e–3 ) , reduced inattentiveness and poorer externalizing behaviors , while accelerated biochemical age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development , apparent even in children
background : many genes associated with asthma explain only a fraction of its heritability . most genome-wide association studies ( GWASs ) used a broad definition of ‘doctor-diagnosed asthma’ , thereby diluting genetic signals by not considering asthma heterogeneity.objectives:the objective of our study was to identify genetic associates of childhood wheezing phenotypes.materials and methods : we conducted a novel multivariate meta-analysis using unbiased analysis of data collected from birth to 18 years in 9568 individuals from five UK birth cohorts.results:four independent SNPs were associated with early-onset persistent , 25 with pre-school remitting , 33 with mid-childhood , and 32 with late-onset wheeze . rs75260654 as the most likely causative single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , associated exclusively with persistent whee.conclusions:we identified a new locus on chr9q21 . 13 ( close to annexin 1 [ANX
introduction : by capitalising on positive biodiversity–productivity relationships , intercropping provides opportunities to improve agricultural sustainability . this study provides the first empirical evidence for the potential of parental diversity affecting plant–plant interactions , species complementarity and therefore potentially ecosystem functioning of the following generations in annual cropping systems . here we show that plant interactions among annual crops shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when the plants were growing in the same community type as their parents did in the previous two generations . however , in fertilized conditions , we observed increased overyielding in mixtures with a common coexistence history . the plant-plant interactions between annual crops and the corresponding changes in complementarities , which could be achieved through specific breeding for mixtures.methods:a total yield did not respond to this common coexist history , but in fertilization conditions . total yield didn't respond to the common co existence history for two generations in monocultures but also in mixed conditions : the six crop species tested converged towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content . in contrast , the six species tested
we compared human and macaque pairs in a transparent version of the coordination game ‘Bach-or-Stravinsky’ , which entails a conflict about which of two individually-preferred opposing options to choose to achieve coordination . most human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize the payoffs . this pair selected the faster agent’s preferred option , exhibiting turn-take behavior that was captured by modeling the visibility of the partner’s action before one’s own movement . the dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans , but can occur on the background of different social attitudes and cognitive capacities in rhesus monkeys , who equally often initiated switches to and from their preferred option.remarkably , two animals learned to coordinate dynamically after training with a human confederate . these pair converged on simpler , static coordination , and adopt dynamic turn -taking . a dynamic coordination model was used to measure action visibility . action visibility promotes the emergence and maintenance of coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions .
granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis . here , we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors ( TFs ) can direct the differentiation of human primordial germ cell-like cells ( hPGCLCs , respectively . we elucidate the regulatory effects of several transcription factors , and establish that a combination of NR5A1 and either rUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granular cells . a method of generating human primordial graccells from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSC ) has been elusive . this model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health . in this model model system , our cells form ovary-like organoids and support hgcLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage .
background : our interest in the genetic basis of skin color variation between populations led us to seek a Native American population with genetically African admixture but low frequency of European light skin alleles.materials and methods : analysis of 458 genomes from individuals residing in the Kalinago Territory of the Commonwealth of Dominica showed approximately 55% Native American , 32% African , and 12% European genetic ancestry . skin pigmentation ranged from 20 to 80 melanin units , averaging 46 . three albino individuals were determined to be homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV contained within a haplotype of African origin ; its allele frequency was 0 . 03 and single allele effect size was –8 , respectively . the allele frequencies of SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F were 0
antioxidant intervention is considered to inhibit reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and alleviate hyperglycemia . Paradoxically , moderate exercise can produce ROS to improve diabetes . the exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains largely unclear . here , by comparing exercise and antioxidant intervention on type 2 diabetic rats , we found moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of re-dox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress . in contrast , antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level recycling . both interventions could promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) signaling ; therefore , ameliorating diabetes
the escape trajectory ( ET ) of prey plays a major role in avoiding predation . previous geometric models predict a single ET ; however , many species show highly variable ETs with multiple preferred directions . the reasons why animals prefer specific multiple ETs remain unclear . here , we constructed a novel geometric model that incorporates the time required for prey to turn and the predator’s position at the end of its attack . by fitting the model to the experimental data of fish Pagrus major , our results open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their ETs from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives .
the recent development of prime editing ( PE ) genome engineering technologies has the potential to significantly simplify the generation of human pluripotent stem cell ( hPSC ) - based disease models . this analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks . here , we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hpcs . by stably integrating the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated , chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs , improved editing efficiency up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles . to improve the efficiency of PE , the expression of the PE component , rather than cell-intrinsic features , limit PE in hepatic cells .
multiple myeloma ( MM ) accounts for 10% of all haematologic malignancies . little is known about high intratumour heterogeneities in patients stratified by the Revised International Staging System ( R-ISS ) . herein , we constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas to compare differential expression patterns among stages . we found that a novel cytotoxic plasma cell ( PC ) population exhibited with significantly elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA was associated with unfavourable prognosis and Epstein-Barr virus infection in our collected samples . furthermore , ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 ( RRM2 ) was found and verified to promote proliferation of MM cell lines , suggesting that R-2 may serve as a detrimental marker in MM progression .
a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the active Cas7-11 from Desulfonema ishimotonii ( DiCas711 ) reveals the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities . the structure and mutational data indicate that the long variable insertion to the fourth cas7-like domain has little impact on target RNA cleavage and has potential applications in RNA interference .
addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity . while most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity , our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited . here , we use a tree species  genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity on tree productivity , and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks . we found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversification , reduced soil fungal diversity and marginally reduced herbivory .
single-molecule imaging provides a powerful way to study biochemical processes in live cells , yet it remains challenging to track single molecules while simultaneously detecting their interactions . here , we describe a novel property of rhodamine dyes , proximity-assisted photoactivation ( PAPA ) , in which one fluorophore ( the ‘sender’ ) can reactivate a second fluorophores from a dark state . we show that PAPA can be used both to detect protein–protein interactions and to highlight a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity . in proof-of-concept experiments , PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level .
objective : to comprehensively summarize the evidence for the effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in young populations ( 35 years ) . this is a systematic review and meta-analysis.materials and methods : the Pubmed , Embase , ProQuest , CENTRAL , WHO Global Index Medicus , Clinical Trials , and Wanfang data databases were systematically searched from database inception to April 25 , 2021.results:moderate certainty of evidence showed that calcium supplements significantly improves bone mass ( standardized mean difference [SMD]0 . 627 , 95% confidence interval [ CI] 0 , 338 . 915; [ ] ) and total body ( smd ) were observed . no effects on total hip BMD and lumbar spine BMC were observed in the peripeak bone mass population ( 20–35 years).conclusion:to comprehensively summarise the evidence
influenza A virus ( IAV ) liquid cytosolic condensates ( aKA viral inclusions ) are good systems to address this question as they form condenses de novo as part of their replication programmes . this study is a starting point for understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions and may offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies . here , we used influenza a virus ( iaa ) fluid cytosulfate hardening via changes in the valency of its components is more efficient than altering their concentration or the temperature of the cell . we used vRNP ( viral ribonucleoprotein ) interactions via the known NP oligomerising molecule , nucleozin , both in vitro and in vivo without affecting host proteome abundance nor solubility .
kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by the energy of ATP hydrolysis . although mutations of kinase elegans cause several diseases , its moleclecular mechanism is unclear because of the difficulty of visualizing the high-resolution structure of kinein-4 working at the microtubue plus-end . here , we report that KLP-12 , a C . ulgans ortholog of KIF21A and kIF21B , is essential for proper length control of axons , and its motor domain represses microtubulation in vitro . the crystal structure of the K
drosophila female germline stem cells ( GSCs ) perpetuate without change over evolutionary time and generate cystoblast daughters that develop into nurse cells and oocytes . cytoblasts initiate differentiation by generating a transient syncytial state , the germline cyst , and by increasing pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification , actions likely to suppress transposable element activity . in all these respects GSC differentiation resembles development of the totipotent zygote .
the circadian clock regulates the timing of late-stage floret development , or anthesis , in domesticated sunflowers . we demonstrate circadian regulation of floral organ growth and show that the effects of light on this process are time-of-day dependent . this coordinated mass release of floral rewards at predictable times of day likely promotes pollinator visits and plant reproductive success . in these plants , up to thousands of individual sunflowers are tightly packed onto a capitulum disk . during anthesis development occurs continuously across capitula to generate iconic spiral phyllotaxy , during a ring -like pseudowhorls with up to hundreds of floretes undergoing simultaneous maturation . however , disruption of circadian rhythms in floral organ development causes loss of pseudowhol formation and large reductions in pollinators visits .
hydrogen peroxide is the most common reactive chemical that organisms face on the microbial battlefield . however , little is known about how organisms cope with this temperature-dependent threat . here , we show that Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes use temperature information perceived by sensory neurons to cope with the temperature-related threat of hydrogen peroxyde produced by the pathogenic bacterium Enterococcus faecium . these nemetodes preemptively induce their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical via an insulin/IGF1 hormone . this is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing its defenses in response to perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons .
class switch recombination generates distinct antibody isotypes critical to a robust adaptive immune system , and defects are associated with autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis . we report that cells lacking two enzymes involved in R loop removal—senataxin and RNase H2 —exhibit increased R loop formation and genome instability at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus without impacting its transcriptional activity , AID recruitment , or class switch
we present a mosaic-type trimeric form of spike receptor-binding domain ( mos-tri-RBD ) as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate , which carries the key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants . tests in rats showed that the designed mos , whether used alone or as an booster shot , elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against non - inflammatory variants and other immune-evasive variants.materials and methods : a study of rats revealed that the design mossa -tri RBD is highly immunogenic , and may serve as an effective vaccine candidate in combating SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicro
leucine aminopeptidase ( PfA-M17 ) is a compound specifically designed to inhibit the activity of Pfa-m17 to show that p . falciparum is essential for survival as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth , many of which are highly likely to originate from hemoglobin . here , we use both reverse genetics and , if necessary , an inhibitor that inhibits the activation of pfa - m17 , which has been implicated in the last step of this digestive pathway . we further show that loss of a . a potential novel drug target was validated as a novel target .
background : hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) gradually differentiate toward specific lineages . in this study , we used single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to characterize an enriched population of human hippocampuses obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals . based on their transcriptional profile , they identified changes in the proportions of progenior compartments during aging , and differences in their functionality , as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis.materials and methods : we analyzed data obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) and detected specific alterations of the expression dynamics of genes involved in erythroid differentiation in all patients with MDS such as TRIB2 . the comparison between transcriptional programs and gene regulatory networks ( gRN ) regulating normal HSBCs and normal HIB2 allowed identification of regulons that were specifically active in patients with TRIb2 , HOXA6 , or POU2F2 suggesting a role of these transcription factors in the pathogenesis of the disease
to investigate the mechanisms that underly individual differences in latent inhibition , we selected two honey bee lines for high and low latent inhibitory , respectively . we then show that disruption of Amtyr1 signaling either pharmacologically or through RNAi qualitatively changes the expression of latent inhibit but has little or slight effects on appetitive conditioning , and these results suggest that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the CNS . this model suggests a mechanism for the broad pleiotropy this gene has on several different behaviors .
the specific functional properties of a tissue are distributed amongst its component cell types . modern approaches for identifying and dissecting novel physiologic mechanisms would benefit from an ability to identify specific cell types in live tissues that could then be imaged in real time . we report a non-invasive imaging modality that capitalizes on the endogenous autofluorescence signatures of the metabolic cofactors NAD ( P ) H and FAD . by marrying morphological characteristics with autofluoescence signature , all seven of the airway epithelial cell types can be distinguished simultaneously in mouse tracheal explants in real-time . furthermore , we find that this methodology for direct cell type-specific identification avoids pitfalls associated with the use of ostensibly cell types-specific markers that are , in fact , altered by clinically relevant physiological stimuli .
methyltransferase-like 3 ( Mettl3 ) plays an important role in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses . however , the role of m6A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear . we modulated methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing ( MeRIP-seq ) and luciferases reporter assays revealed that Fgf16 suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes , but the overexpression of fgf 16 negatively regulates m5A-Ythdf2-dependent manner , thereby controlling cardiovascular regeneration and heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice . to study m6,adenosine methylation catalyzed by the enzyme
the risk of second primary cancer ( SPC ) is increasing after the first primary cancers are diagnosed and treated . the underlying causal relationship remains unclear . we conducted a pan-cancer association ( 26 cancers ) study in the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER ) database ( non-Hispanic whites).methodswe found 11 significant cross-correlations among different cancers after harmonizing SIR and MR results . ovary cancer was identified to be a risk factor for soft tissue cancer . in particular , patients initially diagnosed with oral pharyngeal cancer would have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( SIRSEER = 1 . 18 , 95%Confidence Interval [ CI]:1 . 13–1 , 30 , p=8 . 90  10-3 ) . furthermore , the causal effect was evaluated by two-sample Mendelian Randomization ( MR , 13 FPCs , in the UK Biobank ( UKB
in economic decision-making individuals choose between items based on their perceived value . recent studies in humans suggest that these shifts in gaze actively influence choice , manifesting as a bias in favor of the items that are viewed first , viewed last , or viewed for the overall longest duration in a given trial . this suggests a mechanism that links gaze behavior to the neural computations underlying value-based choices . in order to identify this mechanism , it is first necessary to develop and validate a suitable animal model of this behavior .
the metabolomes of fruit diets and of individuals of a generalist phytophagous species , Drosophila suzukii , that developed on them were investigated . we also showed that many diet-specific metabolites , such as those related to the particular color , odor , or taste of diets , were not metabolized , and rather accumulated in consumer individuals , even when probably detrimental to fitness . this study thus supports the view that dietary generalism may emerge from a passive use of various resources , contrary to more widespread views of an active role of adaptation in this process . here , we simultaneously investigated the metabolic fate of common and rarer dietary compounds , consistent with the metabolic generalism hypothesis .
rcsD , another important gene in the Rcs system , harbours a frameshift mutation . here , we demonstrated that this rcesD mutation followed the emergence of pseudogenization . it further altered the canonical phosphorylation signal cascade , fine-tuning biofilm production to be conducive with retention of the pgm locus in modern lineages of Y . pestis . Taken together , our findings suggest that a framesshift mutation is an important evolutionary step facilitating flea-borne transmission by flea bite .
background : the peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research . however , its subjectivity has raised concerns . to investigate this issue , I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022–2023 . OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports , which demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional lexicon- and rule-based language models . as expected , most reviews for these published papers were seen as favorable by chatGPT ( 89 . 8% of reviews ) , and language use was mostly polite ( 99 .
hepatic metastases are a poor prognostic factor of colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) and new strategies to reduce the risk of liver CRC colonization are highly needed . herein , we used mouse models of hepatostatic metastatization to demonstrate that the continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of interferon-alpha ( IFN ) controls CRC invasion by acting on a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( LSECs ) defenestration extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition , thus strengthening the liver vascular barrier impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration , without requiring a direct action on tumor cells , hepsular macrophages ( LCM ) . besides , the early intravascular tumor burden reduction , supported the generation of antitumor CD8+ T cells and ultimately led to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response .
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) samples collected from vaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains , and characterized 202 individual viral plaques recovered from 13 BALF samples . we identified 54 reassortant viruses that were grouped in 17 single and 16 mixed genotypes . however , direct sequencing from baLF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency , evolutionary rates , or nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions . this study highlights the value of vaccination not only at limiting virus replication but also at protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel ressortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential .
aversive stimuli can cause hippocampal place cells to remap their firing fields , but it is not known whether remapping plays a role in storing memories of averive experiences . here , we addressed this question by performing in vivo calcium imaging of CA1 place cells in freely behaving rats ( n = 14 ) . rats were first trained to prefer a short path over a long path for obtaining food reward , then trained to avoid the short path by delivering a mild footshock . some rats received shock after systemic injections of the amnestic drug scopolamine at a dose ( 1 mg/kg ) that impaired avoidance learning but spared spatial tuning and shock-evoked responses of the CA1 neurons . place cells remapped significantly more following remembered than forgotten shocks ( drug-free versus scopolimin conditions ) and shock evoked response . a series of rats were treated with calcium imaging .
we evaluated the effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells . we demonstrated that targeting inflammasome activation early after infection may represent a therapeutic strategy towards HIV cure to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion and reduce immune activation , viral load , and the HIV-1 reservoir formation in the spleen .
the loss of a spouse is often cited as the most traumatic event in a person’s life . however , for most people , the severity of grief and its maladaptive effects subside over time via an understudied adaptive process . like humans , socially monogamous prairie voles ( Microtus ochrogaster ) form opposite-sex pair bonds , and upon partner separation , show stress phenotypes that diminish over time . we test the hypothesis that extended partner separation diminishes pair bond-associated behaviors and causes pair bond transcriptional signatures to erode .
motor variability is a fundamental feature of developing systems allowing motor exploration and learning . in human infants , leg movements involve a small number of basic coordination patterns called locomotor primitives . whether and when motor variability could emerge from these primitives remains unknown . here we longitudinally followed 18 infants on 2–3 time points between birth and walking onset ( 14 months old ) and recorded the activity of their leg muscles during loco motor or rhythmic movements . utilizing unsupervised machine learning , we show that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development .
the global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to gather and analyse salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( Typhi ) genomic data to inform public health action . this meta-analysis represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date ( n=13 , 000 ) . the data highlight that genotype 4 . 3 . 1 ( H58 ) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa ; in other regions , distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR . ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility ( >1 resistance determinant ) is widespread across geographies and genotype , with high-level antimicrobial resistance ( 3 determinants ) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia . we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal ‘sentinel’ surveillance for such locations .
in Arabidopsis thaliana , this is achieved through cold-mediated epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor , FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) . here , we show that C-repeat / dehydration-responsive elements ( DREs ) at the 3′-end of FLC and CRT/DRE-binding factors are required for cold-induced expression of COOLAIR . we also demonstrate that cbfs and FLCCOOLAIR mutants exhibit a normal vernalization response despite their inability to activate CO
background : HIV-1 reservoir cells that circulate in peripheral blood during suppressive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) have been well characterized , but little is known about the dissemination of HIV-1-infected cells across multiple anatomical tissues , especially the CNS . here , we performed single-genome , near full-length HIV-1 next-generation sequencing to evaluate the proviral landscape in distinct anatomal compartments , including multiple CNS tissues . while lymph nodes and , to a lesser extent , gastrointestinal and genitourinary tissues represented tissue hotspots for the persistence of intact proviruses . we also observed intact provirals in CNS tissue sections , particularly in the basal ganglia , in the frontal lobe , the thalamus and in periventricular white matter . furthermore , evidence for the clonal proliferation
circadian clocks are highly conserved transcriptional regulators that control 24 hr oscillations in gene expression , physiological function , and behavior , synchronized by the brain clock . many disease states are associated with loss of circadian regulation . we developed a method to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live , intact Drosophila , which we term Locally Activatable BioLuminescence , or LABL . utilizing this method , we observed that specific neurona and peripheral - clocks exhibit distinct transcriptional properties . our results demonstrate that locally activatable bioLuminescence ( PDF ) is a circadian neurotransmitter critical for the function of the brain , disrupts circadian locomotor activity but not all tissue-specific clocks .
we demonstrate that a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms an obligate complex with Vin1 , the paralog of the retromer SNx-bAR protein Vps5 . we also find that membrane recruitment by Vin1 is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity , suggesting that VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome . in metazoans , retromer cooperates with VARP , a conserved VPS9-domain GEF , to direct an endosomal recycling pathway . the function of the yeast VARP homolog has been overlooked due to an inactivating mutation found in commonly studied strains .
the effects of temperature on interaction strengths are important for understanding and forecasting how global climate change impacts marine ecosystems . however , tracking and quantifying interactions of marine fish species are practically difficult especially under field conditions , and thus , how temperature influences their interaction strengths under fields remains poorly understood . we herein performed quantitative fish environmental DNA metabarcoding on 550 seawater samples that were collected twice a month from 11 coastal sites for 2 years in the Boso Peninsula , Japan . analyzed eDNA monitoring data using nonlinear time series analytical tools . the impact of water temperature on interspecific interaction strengths varied among fish species , suggesting that fish species identity influences the temperature effects on interactions . although there was a large variation , water temperature influenced fish–fish interaction strengths .
the avian palaeognath phylogeny has been recently revised significantly due to the advancement of genome-wide comparative analyses and provides the opportunity to trace the evolution of the microstructure and crystallography of modern dinosaur eggshells . here , eggs of all major clades of Palaeogae ( including extinct taxa ) and selected eggs of Neognathae and non-avian dinosaurs are analysed with electron backscatter diffraction . ostrich- , rhea-, and tinamou-style morphotypes are best interpreted as homoplastic morphologies ( independently acquired ) . our results show the detailed microstructures and cristallographies of ( previously ) loosely categorized ogrea-style eggshell , respectively . all rhen-style and rha-type morphology are best interpreted as homologous . ancestral state reconstruction and parsimony analysis additionally show that r
we present a hybrid ultrasonic tracking system , Hybrid Vocalization Localizer ( HyVL ) , that synergistically integrates a high-resolution acoustic camera with high-quality ultrason microphones . we analyze mouse courtship interactions and demonstrate that males and females vocalize in starkly different relative spatial positions , and that the fraction of female vocalizations has likely been overestimated previously due to imprecise localization . further , we find that when two male mice interact with one female , one of the males takes a dominant role in the interaction both in terms of the vocalization rate and location relative to the female .
sarcomeres are the force-producing units of all striated muscles . their nanoarchitecture critically depends on the large titin protein , which in vertebrates spans from the sarcomeric Z-disc to the M-band and hence links actin and myosin filaments stably together . however , the instructive role of titines for sarkomeric architecture outside of vertebrats is not as well understood . here , we used a series of nanobodies , , recognising specific domains of the two Drosophila titinos homologs Sallimus and Projectin to determine their precise location in intact flight muscles , using DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy . this architecture may help to stabfully anchor sallimus at the actin filament and hence ensure efficient force transduction during flight .
we present a high-throughput , simple and low-cost microfluidic method for quantitatively measuring the elastic ( storage ) and viscous ( loss ) modulus of individual cells . the fluid shear stress induces large , ear ellipsoidal cell deformations . in addition , the flow profile in the channel causes the cells to rotate in a tank-treading manner . we extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic cell properties based on a theoretical framework developed by R . Roscoe [1] that describes the deformation of a viscosity fluid under steady laminar flow . our measurements demonstrate that suspended cells exhibit power-law , soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell-cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks .
mitochondrial dysfunction is not a recognized cause of isolated cardiomyopathy . here , we determined that the rare mitofusin ( MFN ) 2 R400Q mutation is 15–20 over-represented in clinical cardiomyopathies , whereas this specific mutation is not reported as a cause of MFN2 mutant-induced peripheral neuropathy , Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2A ( CMT2A ) . we interrogated the enzymatic , biophysical , and functional characteristics of mFN2 Q400 versus wild-type and cMT2a-causing Mfn2 mutants . compared to wild - type and CMT2-A-causing mrna , the canonical fusion exhibited normal activation-induced changes in conformational shifting . this mutation evokes mitochondrial motility , provoke mitochondrial depolarization , or dominantly suppress mitochondrial respiration like MFN 2 T105M .
we hypothesized that olfactory information might also have a sex-specific effect on lifespan , and we show here that the lifespan of female mice can be increased significantly by odors from adult females administered transiently , that is from 3 days until 60 days of age . conditional deletion of the G protein Go in the olefactory system , which leads to impaired accessory olococcus function and blunted reproductive priming responses to male odor in females , did not modify the effect of female lifespan . in particular , male lifespan can in some circumstances delay maturation , as tested by manipulations of litter size , growth hormone levels , or mutations with effects specifically on early-life growth rate . a potential example of lifespan extension by oilfactory cues in mice .
despite the popularity of designer drugs ( DREADDs ) in neuroscience and sleep research , potential effects of the chemogenetic actuator clozapine-N-oxide ( CNO ) on sleep have never been systematically tested . here , we show that intraperitoneal injections of commonly used CNO doses ( 1 , 5 , and 10 mg/kg ) alter sleep in wild-type male laboratory mice . utilizing electroencephalography ( EEG ) and electromyography ( eMG ) to analyse sleep , our results demonstrate that both CNO and C21 can modulate sleep despite a lack of back-metabolism to clozpine or binding to endogenous neurotransmitter receptors . we suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenic actuators.
microorganism sensing of and responding to ambient chemical gradients regulates a myriad of microbial processes that are fundamental to ecosystem function and human health and disease . here , we present a novel microfluidic multiplexed chemotaxis device ( MCD ) which uses serial dilution to simultaneously perform six parallel bacterial chemolaxis assays that span five orders of magnitude in chemostimulant concentration on a single chip . we first validated the gradient generation performance of the mCD , and then compared the measured chetomotactic responses of different bacteria ( Psuedoalteromonas haloplanktis , Escherichia coli ) to different chemoattractants and chemorepellents . the MCD vastly accelerates the che
neural crest development is known to be transcriptionally controlled via sequential activation of gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) . recent evidence increasingly implicates a role for post-transcriptional regulation in modulating the output of these regulatory circuits . utilizing available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from avian embryos to identify potential post-transscriptional regulators , we found that Elavl1 , which encodes for an RNA -binding protein with roles in transcript stability , was enriched in the premigratory cranial neural tube as well as significant reduction in transcripts associated with the neuronal crest specification GRN , phenotypes that are also observed with downregulation of the canonical Wnt inhibitor Draxin.
despite their critical function , the principles that dictate how respiratory circuits assemble are unknown . here , we show that coordinated activity of a type I cadherin ( N-cadhin ) and type II cadhrins ( Cadherin-6 , -9 , and -10 ) is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output . this combinatorial cadhein code is required to establish phrenic MN cell body and dendritic topography . surprisingly , however , cell body position appears to be dispensable for the targeting of pehric motor neurons ( Mns ) by descending respiratory inputs . inactivation in mice during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure .
the powerful allure of social media platforms has been attributed to the human need for social rewards . here , we demonstrate that the spread of misinformation on such platforms is facilitated by existing social ‘carrots’ ( e . g. , ‘likes’ ) and 'sticks’ that are dissociated from the veracity of the information shared . we show that a slight change to the incentive structure of social platforms , such that social rewards and punishments are contingent on information veracité , produces a considerable increase in the discernment of shared information . this effect is associated with an increase in weight participants assign to evidence consistent with discerning behavior .
chromosomes remain persistently attached via kinetochores to the tips of disassembling microtubules , which pull the sister chromatids apart . this idea requires modifying the mechanical and energetic properties of curling protofilaments , but no way to do so has yet been described . here , we show that their mechanical energy output can be increased by adding magnesium , and that yeast microtubulations generate larger and more energetic working strokes than bovine microtubulates . these observations demonstrate how work output from curls can be tuned and suggest evolutionary conservation of the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubular lattice .
introduction : when attacked , hagfishes produce a soft , fibrous defensive slime within a fraction of a second by ejecting mucus and threads into seawater . the rapid setup and remarkable expansion of the slime make it a highly effective and unique form of defense . how this biomaterial evolved is unknown , although circumstantial evidence points to the epidermis as the origin of the thread- and mucuses-producing cells in the Slime glands . here , we describe large intracellular threads in a putatively homologous cell type from hag fish epidermies , with each square millimeter of skin storing a total of 96 cm threads.materials and methods : these epidermal threads averaged 2 mm in length and 0 . 5 m in diameter .
[ purpose ] this study aimed to evaluate for disease modifying effects of sodium selenate treatment in the chronically epileptic rat post-status epilepsy ( SE ) model of drug-resistant TLE . [ subjects and methods ] Wistar rats underwent kainic acid-induced SE or sham . one week of continuous video-EEG was acquired before , during , and 4 , 8 weeks post-treatment , followed by behavioral tests . to evaluate the effects of the treatments , we performed a video-eg on post-mortem brain tissue to identify potential pathways associated with modified disease outcomes .
introduction : fracture is associated with an increased risk of mortality , but mortality is not part of doctor-patient communication . here , we introduce a new concept called ‘Skeletal Age’ as the age of an individual’s skeleton resulting from a fragility fracture to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual.methods:we used the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register which includes the whole-country data of 1 , 667 , 339 adults in Denmark born on or before December 31 , 2016 for incident low-trauma fracture and mortality.results:skeletal age is defined as the sum of chronological age and the number of years of life lost associated with a fracture for a given risk profile , and the hazard was then transformed into YLL using the Gompertz law of mortality.conclusion:a fracture was associated with between 1 and 7 years of lifetime lost ( yLL).conclusions:there were 307 , 870 fractures and 122 , 744 post-fracture deaths . there had been 307
abstractaccurate brain tissue extraction on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data is crucial for analyzing brain structure and function . although several conventional tools have been optimized to handle human brain data , there have been no generalizable methods to extract brain tissues for multimodal MRI data from rodents , nonhuman primates , and humans . therefore , developing a flexible and semi-supervised deep neural network , named the Brain Extraction Net ( BEN ) , would allow researchers to analyze and compare experiment results more efficiently.
the fungal pathobiont Candida albicans expresses a family of extracellular CFEM hemophores that capture heme from host proteins and transfer it across the cell wall to the cell membrane . here , we identified Frp1 and Frp2 , two ferric reductase ( fRE ) -related proteins that lack an extracellular N-terminal substrate-binding domain , as being required for hemoglobin hemin , consistent with a direct role in human trafficking .
the seventh pandemic of the diarrheal cholera disease , which began in 1960 , is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio . its environmental persistence provoking recurring sudden outbreaks is enabled by the rapid adaption to changing environments involving sensory proteins like toxR and ToxS . Located at the inner membrane , Toxr and toxS react to environmental stimuli like bile acid , thereby inducing survival strategies for example bille resistance and virulence regulation . our data propose an interdependent functionality between ToxRS transcriptional activity and sensory function , further emphasizing its significance .
the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory . recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior–posteriore axes of a human brain , but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear . we leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior - posed anterior – posed - in vivo human brains . our results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the posterior axises of the brain preferentially connect within the human brain and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic connectivity exist within the hematosphere . a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints , we characterised where these cortically connect within a patient brain . these findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasise the importance of considering the h
a mouse model expressing the constitutively active TANK-binding kinase 1 ( TBK1 ) variant of interferon genes ( STING ) expresses dopaminergic neurons , which are particularly sensitive to stress and represent a circumscribed population that can be precisely quantified . to test whether STING activation is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration , we analysed the axon terminals and the striatum . we also observed alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta , by measuring mRNAs , proteins and nuclear translocation of transcription factors . in adult mice expressing N153S , neuroinflammation was quantified by staining astroglia and microglia . neuroinflammatory markers were already elevated in juvenile mice , however at this age the number of dopamina was still unaffected , thus preceding the degeneration of dsDNA .
despite the remarkable successes of cancer immunotherapies , the majority of patients will experience only partial response followed by relapse of resistant tumors . although treatment resistance has frequently been attributed to clonal selection and immunoediting , comparisons of paired primary and rerelapsed tumors in melanoma and breast cancers indicate that they share the majority clones . here , we demonstrate in both mouse models and clinical human samples that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique transient cell-in-cell structures , which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies.
[ purpose ] this study explored how marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ) , a highly social primate species , process Frith-Happé animations by examining gaze patterns and brain activations of marmosots and humans as they observed these animations . [ subjects and methods ] we analyzed the brain activation patterns and gaze patterns of both species and humans , which indicate a distinction between toM and non-ToM scenarios . the results revealed that both species activated extensive and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM versus Random animations as they exhibited longer fixations on one of the triangles in ToM animations and exhibited shorter fixation duration on the ToM animateds compared to other conditions . however , we did not observe the same pattern of longer overall fixation length on the tom animations in both species as identified in humans . this study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities , shed light on potential similarities and differences in toM processing .
transcriptional and translational mechanisms poise stem cells for a timely cell-state transition during differentiation . although important for all stemness-to-differentiation transitions , mechanistic understanding of the fine-tuning of gene transcription is lacking due to the compensatory effect of translational control . we demonstrate that the transcription factor FruitlessC ( FruC ) binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in neuroblasts . Identical to fruC loss-of-function , reducing polycomb Repressive Complex 2 activity increases stemness gene activity .
despite being a type of professional phagocyte , neutrophils are thought to be excluded from apoptotic sites to avoid tissue inflammation . here , we report a fundamental and unexpected role of a neutrophil as the predominant phagocytosis responsible for the clearance of hepatic cells in the steady state . in contrast to the engulfment of dead cells by macrophages , neutralophils burrowed directly into a poptotic hepatocytes . the depletion of neutrophil was caused by a specialized immunologically silent mechanism , and defects in this key housekeeping function contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune liver disease .
the neuroanatomical arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal circuits . to more precisely define how premotor interneurons contacting specific motor neuron pools are organized , we used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice to minimize systematic biases associated with each method . thus , premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components . we found that premotor innervating specific motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons .
this study identifies a respiratory-related brain network underpinned by neural activity , which represents a novel component in the respiration–rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related resting-state fMRI artifacts . to elucidate this issue , here we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology , rstMRI , and respiration signals in rats . our data show that respiration is indeed associated with neural activity changes , evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrical signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex . this relationship is largely unexplored . in addition , this neural activity disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced at an isoelectrical state , while the respirations is maintained , further confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network .
predators that target multiple prey types are predicted to switch foraging modes according to prey profitability to increase energy returns in dynamic environments . we show that these bats use two foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures of 25 small , aerial insects and 29 large , ground-dwelling insects per bat , but with much higher capture success in the air vs ground ( 30% ) . however , owing to the 3–20 times larger ground prey , the 85% of the nightly food acquisition comes from ground despite the 2 . 5 times higher failure rates . this is the first report of bat-borne tags and DNA metabarcoding of feces to test the hypothesis that greater mouse-eared bats make immediate foraging decisions based on prey rent and changes in the environment .
the evolution of human right-handedness has been intensively debated for decades . manual lateralization patterns in non-human primates have the potential to elucidate evolutionary determinants of human handedness , but restricted species samples and inconsistent methodologies have so far limited comparative phylogenetic studies . by combining original data with published literature reports , we assembled data on hand preferences for standardized object manipulation in 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates , including monkeys , ape , and humans . based on that , our data show that human lateralized patterns of hand preference strength show signatures of both ecology , brain size and tool use in primate handedness evolution . in particular , terrestrial primates tend to display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species , suggesting that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species .
the endocannabinoid system ( ECS ) , given its relevance for both cognitive and cardiovascular function , could be a potential druggable target in this syndrome . we analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion ( CD ) mouse model of Williams–Beuren syndrome ( WBS ) and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation in key phenotypes relevant for WBS.materials and methodswe analyzed components of a complete deletion mouse model . a subchronic ( 10 days ) JZL184 , a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase , specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenome of CD mice . the results reveal the modulation of the eCS as a promising novel therapeutic approach to improve key traits of WBS and restore gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue .
chinmo promotes growth in larval and adult progenitor cells in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner , respectively . however , how these transcription factors determine temporal identity in developing tissues is poorly understood . here , we report on the role of the larval specifier chinmo as a juvenile specifier during fly development . we suggest that the sequential expression of the transcription factors chino , Br-c , and E93 during larval , pupa an adult respectively , coordinates the formation of the different organs that constitute the adult organism .
cycling of co-substrates , whereby a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions , is ubiquitous in metabolism . in the cases of a single reaction and linear pathways , we find that co- substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction , distinct to the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalysing that reaction . we show that regulation of these two parameters can allow regulation of flux dynamics in branched and coupled pathways.
activation of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 ( NFATc1 ) is a crucial regulator of articular , but not growth-plate , chondrocyte differentiation during development . we identified that the nuclear factor of activated NFatc1 ( n = 1 ) was a critical regulator of the differentiation of the kinase - mediated articulas . at the early stage of mouse knee development ( embryonic day 13 . 5 ) , activated t cells were mainly located in the flanking region of the joint interzone . with development , activation , and chondrogenesis were sufficient for colony formation and multipotent differentiation . a set of characteristic genes were found in activated activated cells in limb growth -plate primordium . the expression of n=1 was diminished with articulation . however , suppressing n - expression in articulary cartilage progenitors was sufficient to induce spontaneous chodogenesis .
photosystem II ( PSI ) uses the energy from red light to split water and reduce quinone , an energy-demanding process based on chlorophyll a ( Chl-a ) photochemistry . two types of cyanobacterial PSII can use chlororophyll d ( chloro-d ) and chloroococcidiopsis thermalis to perform the same reactions using lower energy , far-red light . here , we compare enzyme turnover efficiency , forward electron transfer , back-reactions and photodamage in , compared to the recombination via PD1+Phe- repopulation , leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage . we show that: ( i ) all types of PSiI have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover and/or resilience to photodamaging .
the skeletal system contains a series of sophisticated cellular lineages arising from the mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) and hematopoietic stem cells that determine the homeostasis of bone and bone marrow . here , we reasoned that osteocyte may exert a function in regulation of these lineage cell specifications and tissue homeostastasis . utilizing a mouse model of conditional deletion of osterocytes by the expression of diphtheria toxin subunit  in dentin matrix protein 1 ( DMP1 ) -positive ostenocytes , our results demonstrate that partial ablation of dMP1-negative oseocytes caused severe sarcopenia , osteoporosis , and degenerative kyphosis leading to shorter lifespan in these animals . we demonstrated that partial adduction of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells was the underlying cause .
this redundancy at the genetic level , where many mutations have similar phenotypic and fitness effects , can make untangling the molecular mechanisms of complex adaptations difficult . to understand how different genomic changes could lead to parallel fitness gains , we characterize the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across 12 replicate populations evolving in parallel for 50 , 000 generations . by quantifying absolute changes in mRNA abundances , clones from replicate populations in the Escherichia coli long-term evolution experiment ( LTEE ) are remarkably similar in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional or translational levels . we also find that not only do all evolved lines have more mrs but that this increase in mmRNA abundance scales with cell size .
CD133 ( prominin 1 ) is widely viewed as a cancer stem cell marker in association with drug resistance and cancer recurrence . herein , we report that with impaired RTK-Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling , heterogenous hepatocytes form clusters that manage to divide during mouse liver regeneration . these hepocytes are characterized by upregulated CD133 while negative for other progenitor cell markers . pharmaceutical inhibition of proliferative signaling also induced CD133 expression in various cancer cell types from multiple animal species , suggesting an inherent and common mechanism of stress response .
retinal ciliopathies manifest from sensory abnormalities to syndromic disorders with multi-organ pathologies , with retinal degeneration a highly penetrant phenotype . to identify drug candidates to maintain photoreceptor survival , we performed an unbiased , high-throughput screening of over 6000 bioactive small molecules using retinal organoids differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) of rd16 mouse , which is a model of Leber congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) type 10 caused by mutations in the cilia-centrosomal gene CEP290 . we identified five non-toxic positive hits , including the lead molecule reserpine , who maintained photoreception development and survival in rs16 organoids , and in vivo . further investigation uncovered dysregulation of autophagy associated with compromised primary cilium biogenesis in patient organoids and a mouse retina . our study highlights the impact of proteostasis in the pathogenesis of retinal neurodegeneration
amygdalin , a cyanogenic glycoside found in honey bee-pollinated almond trees , can be metabolized by both bees and members of the gut microbiota . we found strains of Bifidobacterium wkB204 , Bombilactobacillus , and Gilliamella , that can degrade amygienine into hydrogen cyanide . the degradation mechanism appears to vary since only some strains produce prunasin as an intermediate . in vitro experiments demonstrated that the metabolite is a byproduct when cell lysates were cultured with amyged with a glycoside hydrolase family 3 ( GH3 ) , supporting its contribution to the degradation of dietary plant metabolites . here , we demonstrate that both host and microbiotes can act together to metabolize dietary phytometabolites in the gut .
Candida albicans causes severe invasive candidiasis . however , the mechanism that CL uses to permeabilize membranes is unclear . we reveal that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism . Unexpectedly , CL readily assembled into polymers in solution . We propose that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer , which is sequentially added into a string configuration that can close into the membrane to become pores .
objective : to evaluate whether presenting a ( placebo ) analgesia machine as personalised would improve its effectiveness . methods : we recruited 102 adults in two samples ( N1=17 , N2=85 ) to receive painful heat stimulations on their forearm . during half of the stimulations , a machine purportedly delivered an electric current to reduce their pain . participants were either told that the machine was personalised to their genetics and physiology , or that it was effective in reducing pain generally . the participants reported more relief in pain intensity than the control group in both the feasibility study ( standardised =0 . 50 [–1 . 08 , and the pre-registered double-blind confirmatory study ) . we found similar effects on pain unpleasantness and several personality traits moderated the results . our findings could potentially improve the methodology of precision medicine research and inform practice
sister neurons with different levels of notch expression ( notchON/NotchOFF ) develop distinct identities and diverge into separate circuits . notch-differentiated sister neurons have been observed in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum , but whether they integrate into shared or distinct circuits remains unknown . here , we evaluate how sister V2a /V2b ( NotchON ) neurons in the zebrafish integrate into spinal circuits.materials and methodswe identified pairs of sister / V2b neurons born from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and observed that they have somata in close proximity to each other and similar axonal trajectories . paired whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics revealed that sister v2a/b neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources , do not communicate with each other , and connect to largely distinct targets .
transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but is also involved in restraint of the response to activity deprivation . however , the magnitude of homeostasis is constrained . here , we uncover negative regulation of cortical network homeostatism by the PARbZIP family of transcription factors . the network response to prolonged activity withdrawal measured with calcium imaging is much stronger , while baseline activity is unchanged . this study aimed to investigate the role of the transcription factor , a transcription factor that is critical for constraining plasticity and for preventing life-threatening seizures . a significant increase in the frequency of mini excitatory synaptic currents reflecting enhanced upregulation of recurrent excitator transmission .
paired gene expression ( RNA-seq ) and chromatin accessibility ( ATAC-Seq) data from SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) during embryonic development in Mus musculus were analysed . paired RNA and ATAC seq data were analyzed during embryonal development . the paired expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) signaling in the developing lung epithelium was observed between E11 . 5 and E16 . 5. , particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements ( e. g. enhancer ) , implicating p  0.001 ) in the developmental regulation of SOx9+ progenitors . this model demonstrates that pcr signaling is required for the development of a single - cell - type identity , and emphasizes the combinatorial power of paired
background : working memory ( WM ) is one of the most affected cognitive domains in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . recent observations based on the continuous reproduction paradigms have shown that assuming dynamic allocation of WM resources ( resource model ) instead of the binary hypothesis will give more accurate predictions in WM assessment . thereby , by utilizing two continuous reproducing paradigms , memory-guided localization ( MGL ) and analog recall task with sequential presentation , we investigated WM dysfunction in MS.materials and methods : this study offered a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit and provided new insights into the organization of the WM system in MS population.results:the results demonstrated an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS . while sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy control from relapsing-remitting from secondary progressive , MGL were more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes . we found that imprecision in decoding information and swap error ( mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items ) was
the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin ( DSK ) plays an important role in the descending control of nociception in mammals . here , we show that Drosophila has a descending inhibitory mechanism of nociceptive regulation at a single-cell resolution , and identified a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception . this study provides the first evidence for an descending modulatory mechanism of neuronociceptive regulation in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved cholecystokinin system . we found that mutants lacking dsk or its receptors are hypersensitive to noxious heat . through a combination of genetic , behavioral , histological , or ca2+ imaging analyses , subsequently revealed neurons involved in DSK-mediated descending neococcus .
a cucumber-infecting fungus , Colletotrichum orbiculare , demonstrated that the translational inhibitory effects of rocaglates were largely attenuated by the mutation found in the Aglaia parasite . our study exemplifies a plant–fungus tug-of-war centered on secondary metabolites produced by host plants . the plant-parasitizing bacterium overcomes the toxicity of an amino acid substitution in a eukaryotic translation initiation factor ( eIF ) .
background : psychophysical methods are a cornerstone of psychology , cognitive science , and neuroscience where they have been used to quantify behavior and its neural correlates for a vast range of mental phenomena . their power derives from the combination of controlled experiments and rigorous analysis through signal detection theory . unfortunately , they require many tedious trials and preferably highly trained participants . however , what has precluded wide adoption of this approach is that current analysis methods do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task and therefore recover perceptual thresholds that are larger compared to equivalent traditional psychophysical experiments . here , we introduce a computational analysis framework for continuous psychophysics based on Bayesian inverse optimal control.materials and methods : we show via simulations and previously published data that this not only recovers the perceptual thresholds but additionally estimates subjects’ action variability , internal behavioral costs and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics.results:a recently developed approach , continuous psychophysical , promises to transform the field by abandoning the rigid trial structure involving binary responses and replacing it with continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli .
we previously derived a normative decision model in which evidence accumulation is adapted to fluctuations in the evidence-generating process that occur during a single decision , but the evolution of commitment rules ( e . g . thresholds on the accumulated evidence ) under dynamic conditions is not fully understood . here , we derive an adaptive model for decisions based on changing contexts , which we define as changes in evidence quality or reward , over the course of an individual decision . in these cases , performance ( reward rate ) is maximized using decision thresholds that respond to and even anticipate these changes , in contrast to the static thresholds used in many decision models . we show that these adaptive thresholds exhibit several distinct temporal motifs that depend on the specific predicted and experienced context changes and that adaptive models perform robustly even when implemented imperfectly ( noisily ) . this results further link normative and neural decision-making while expanding our view of both as dynamic , adaptive processes that update and use expectations to govern both deliberation and commitment .
despite efforts from scientists and regulators , biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate . unless we find transformative solutions to preserve biodiversity , future generations may not be able to enjoy nature’s services . here , we apply explainable network models with multimodal learning to community-level functional biodiversity measured with multilocus metabarcoding , to establish correlations with biocides and climate change records . we observed that the freshwater community assemblage and functionality changed over time without returning to its original state , even if the lake partially recovered in recent times .
we evaluated this proposition using multivariate analysis of high temporal resolution electroencephalographic data . we tracked neural position representations of moving objects at different stages of visual processing , relative to the real-time position of the object . During early stimulus-evoked activity , position representation of moving stimuli were activated substantially earlier than the equivalent activity evoked by unpredictable flashes , aligning the earliest representations with their real -time positions . these findings indicate that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for the neural delays accumulated early in stimulus processing . in motion perception , the brain may overcome these fundamental delays through predictively encoding the position of moving object using information from their past trajections .
we investigated this question using a unique human model with varying amounts and qualities of early language exposure : early deaf adults who were born to hearing parents and had reduced early exposure and delayed acquisition of any natural human language ( speech or sign ) , with early dna adults who acquired sign language from birth as the control group that matches on nonlinguistic sensory experiences . we found that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe , highlighting the roles of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences.resultsneural responses in a semantic judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups were measured using fMRI . a semantic sensitivity was measured using multivariate pattern ( semantic structure encoding ) and univariate ( abstractness effect ) analyses , in the dATL , showed reduced semantic
we show that dorsal CA1 place cells in rats can modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts . this experience-dependent phenomenon mirrors the same pattern of rate modulation observed during behavior and can be used independently from place information within replay sequences to discriminate between contexts.resultsreplay , the sequential reactivation within a neuronal ensemble , is a central hippocampal mechanism postulated to drive memory processing . while both rate and place representations are used to encode behavioral episodes , replay has been largely defined by only the latter – based on the fidelity of sequential activity across neighboring place fields . here , we demonstrate that doorsal c1 place cell in rats modulate firing rate during behavior . these results reveal the existence of two complementary neural representations available for memory processes .
spermatogenesis and male infertility are common manifestations associated with mitochondrial diseases , yet the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions remain elusive . in this study , we demonstrate that mice deficient for the mitochondrial intra-membrane rhomboid protease PARL develop early testicular atrophy caused by a complete arrest of spermogenesis during meiotic prophase I , followed by degeneration and death of arrested spermaticocytes . we further observed severe abnormalities in mitochondrial ultrastructure in PARL-deficient mice , along with prominent electron transfer chain defects , disrupted coenzyme Q ( CoQ ) biosynthesis , and metabolic rewiring . these mitochondrial defects induced by PARL depletion act as an initiating trigger for ferroptosis in primary spermatitocytes through simultaneous effects on GPX4 and co-inzyme - two major inhibitors of ferroptogenic arrest . this process is independent of neurodegeneration . furthermore , genetic modifications of PINK1 , PGAM5
hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 ( fGF21 ) inhibits hepatic lipotoxicity , inflammation , and fibrogenesis . however , the mechanisms by which they alleviate liver injury have only been scarcely addressed . here , we aimed to unveil the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of ff21 on a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) using APOE*3-Leiden .
the neurophysiology of cells and tissues is monitored electrophysiologically and optically in diverse experiments and species , ranging from flies to humans . understanding the brain requires integration of data across this diversity , and thus these data must be findable , accessible , interoperable , or reusable ( FAIR ) . this requires a standard language for data and metadata that can coevolve with neuroscience . we describe design and implementation principles for a language for neurophysiological data . our open-source software ( Neurodata Without Borders , NWB ) defines and modularize the interdependent , yet separable components of a data language . more broadly , the design principles of NWB are generally applicable to enhance discovery across biology through data FAIRness .
infection with influenza A virus ( IAV ) causes the well-known symptoms of the flu , including fever , loss of appetite , and excessive sleepiness . these responses , mediated by the brain , will normally disappear once the virus is cleared from the system , but a severe respiratory virus infection may cause long-lasting neurological disturbances . the mechanisms behind such long lasting changes are unknown . to gain insight into the neuronal and non-neuronal molecular changes during an IAV infection , we intranasally infected mice with an H1N1 virus and extracted the brain at different time points . utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing ( snRNA-seq ) of the hypothalamus , our data showed the most pronounced transcriptional response at 3 days past infection with a strong downregulation of genes across all cell types .
inducing polarity-gene l ( 2 ) gl-knockdown ( lg-KD ) causes invasive multilayering of the follicular epithelia . a genetic requirement of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in promoting multilayer formation of ll-kD cells was further identified . we identified a previously unappreciated link between a gene expression requirement of the gene expression of the cell . the underlying gene expression was determined by a single-cell RNA sequencing of drosophila ovaries , where invasive invasive polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is associated with invasive cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis .
background : the degree of confidence in the information obtained through either route should determine the impact that it has on adapting and changing behaviour . we examined whether and how behavioural and neural computations differ during non-social learning as opposed to learning from social sources.materials and methods : trial-wise confidence judgements about non- social and social information sources offered a window into this learning process.results:despite matching exactly the statistical features of social and non-social conditions , confidence judgments were more accurate and less changeable when they were made about social as opposed
a molecular exocytosis model based on this positive allosteric stabilization and the assumptions that ( 1 . ) synaptotagmin Ca2+/PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dual-binding lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by 5 kBT . the model , which relies on biochemically measured Ca2 +/PI affinities and protein copy numbers , reproduced the steep ca2+ dependency of neurotransmitter release . here , we devise a model that relies upon the assumption that ( 2 , 1 , ) the effect of multiple synaptamins on the energetic barrier is additive . we show that mutations altering synaptic properties may show dominant-negative effects , even though synaptophageal changes of local phospholipid PI ( p  0.001 ) , and that ( e g . upon ve
the early evolutionary history of sauropterygians and their phylogenetic relationships with other groups within Diapsida is still incompletely understood . here , we report a new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic ( Olenekian ) of South China – Prosaurospharachrgis yingzishanensis gen . et sp. nov . representing the earliest known occurrence of the clade . furthermore , our phylogueenetic analysis supports the placement of Testudines and Archosauromorpha within archelosauria , a result strongly corroborated by molecular data , but only recently recovered in a morphology-only dataset .
background : smoking-associated DNA methylation levels identified through epigenome-wide association studies ( EWASs ) are generally ascribed to smoking-reactive mechanisms , but the contribution of a shared genetic predisposition to smoking is typically not accounted for.methods:we exploited a strong within-family design , that is , the discordant monozygotic twin design to study reactiveness of genetically identical genes to smoking and reversibility of methylations patterns upon quitting smoking.results:there are 13 differentially methylated genes in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , which encode subunits of the calcium voltage-gated channel and G protein , respectively . in pairs discordants for current or former smoking , we found that the neoplasms of current smoking twins are reactive to nicotine exposure.conclusions:in pairs dicordant or concordant for current and former smokers who never smoked , a single - chromosome - related twins were found to be reactive to smoking .
retinal function in vivo , however , remains elusive , especially in awake animals . here , we performed single-unit extracellular recordings in the optic tract of head-fixed mice to compare the output of awake , anesthetized , and ex-vivo retinas . we found that awake retinal output had in general ( 1 ) faster kinetics with less variability in the response latencies ; ( 2 ) a larger dynamic range ; and ( 3 ) higher firing activity , by 20 Hz on average , for both baseline and visually evoked responses . the visual response properties were overall similar across conditions , but the retina employs dense coding , rather than sparse efficient coding as has been often assumed from ex vivor studies . these results highlight distinct retinal behavior in awake states .
paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) is an essential step in numerous biological techniques as it is thought to preserve a snapshot of biomolecular transactions in living cells . here , we compared images , before and after fixation , of cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins that are able to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) in vivo . we further established a kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein–protein interactions . simulations based on the model suggest that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics , the overall rate of fixed cells , and notably , a difference between fixation rates of different proteins .
intracellular bacterial communities ( IBCs ) are characterized by bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation . however , the dynamic responses of IBC to host stresses and antibiotic therapy are difficult to assess in situ . we develop a human bladder-chip model wherein umbrella cells and bladder microvascular endothelial cells are co-cultured under flow in urine and nutritive media respectively , and bladder filling and voiding mimicked mechanically by application and release of linear strain . utilizing time-lapse microscopy , we show that rapid recruitment of neutrophils from the vascular channel to sites of infection leads to swarm and neutrophil extracellular trap formation but does not prevent IBC formation .
ammonium ( NH4+ ) is essential to generate the nitrogenous building blocks of life . it gets assimilated via the canonical biosynthetic routes to glutamate and is further distributed throughout metabolism via a network of transaminases . this strain allowed us to systematically study which amino acids serve as amine sources . we found that several amino acids complemented the auxotrophy either by producing glutamates via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutammonium . in this network , we identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase ( DadA ) as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates . furthermore , the amino acids ( -alanine , glycine , serine , and serine as new amine source . also , our study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network .
reef-building corals thrive in oligotrophic environments due to their possession of endosymbiotic algae . however , it remains unknown how carbon is released from the algal symbiont for uptake by the host . here , we show , using cultured smbiotic dinoflagellate , Breviolum sp . , that decreases in pH directly accelerates the release of monosaccharides , which is , glucose and galactose , into the ambient environment . the cell surface structures were deformed and genes related to cellulase were significantly upregulated . we suggest that the low pH signals the cellul
nephronophthisis ( NPHP ) is a ciliopathy characterized by renal fibrosis and cyst formation , and accounts for a significant portion of end stage renal disease in children and young adults . presently , no targeted therapy is available for this disease . however , the precise contribution of different cell types and the relationship between epithelial cysts and interstitial fibroses remains undefined . here , we generated and characterized cell-type-specific knockout mouse models of invs , investigated the impact of removing cilia genetically on phenotype severity in Invs mutants and analyzed the effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid ( VPA ) on in vitro . furthermore , increased cell proliferation and myofibroblast activation occurred early during disease progression and preceded detectable cyst formation in the Inv
the adult-expressed hemoglobin ( Hb ) of this sirenian is shown to harbor a fixed amino acid replacement at an otherwise invariant position ( /82LysAsn ) that alters multiple aspects of Hb function . this phenotype presumably safeguarded tissue and maternal/fetal O2 delivery to cool peripheral tissues and largely arises from a reduced intrinsic temperature sensitivity of the H . gigas protein . furthermore , our functional characterization of recombinant sirerian Hb proteins demonstrates that the Hb-O2 affinity of this sub-Arctic species was less affected by temperature than those of living ( sub ) tropical sea cows .
expression of activated Ras , RasV12 , provides Drosophila cultured cells with a proliferation and survival advantage that simplifies the generation of continuous cell lines . this technique has produced in vitro cell models with characteristics of muscle , glial , and epithelial cell type . furthermore , cell lines with neuronal and hemocyte characteristics were isolated by cloning from cell cultures established with broad Rasv12 expression .
multiciliated cells ( MCCs ) are terminally differentiated epithelia that assemble multiple motile cilia used to promote fluid flow . in cycling cells , the master regulator of centriole assembly Polo-like kinase 4 ( PLK4 ) is essential for centrioler duplication ; however recent work has questioned the role of PLK 4 in centriol amplification in MCC . to address this discrepancy , we created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both pLK4 protein and protein activity are critical for centromagnetic assembly . these results show that the initial stages of apical surface area expansion are conserved between cycling cells and mCCs and suggest that centriola assembly and surface expansion are coordinated events .
the human endometrium experiences repetitive cycles of tissue wounding characterised by piecemeal shedding of the surface epithelium and rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis . this study aimed to investigate whether epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium have their origins in one or more of the mesenchymal cell types present in the stromal compartment of the endommetrium . utilizing scRNAseq , we identified a novel population of PDGFRa+ and perivascular cells ( NG2/CSPG4+ ) that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometry breakdown/repair . to confirm our hypothesis we used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of these cells . we demonstrated that stroma fibroblasts can undergo a re-epithelial transformation and become epithelized luminal surface of the repaired tissue .
adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions is difficult to achieve . phase variation mechanisms can overcome this difficulty by altering genomic architecture in a subset of individuals , creating a phenotypically heterogeneous population with subpopulations optimized to persist when conditions change , or are encountered , suddenly . we have identified a phase variation system in Burkholderia thailandensis that generates a genotypically and p  0.05 . genetic analyses revealed that RecA-mediated homologous recombination between a pair of insertion sequence 2-like elements replicates 208 . 6 kb region of DNA that contains 157 coding sequences . a copy number of the region is varied and dynamic within populations . this system represents a rare example of IS element-mediated evolution , in which the IS elements provide a selective advantage under specific growth conditions , thereby expanding the lifestyle repertoire of the species .
the rate and accuracy of translation hinges upon multiple components – including transfer RNA pools , tRNA modifying enzymes , and rRNA molecules – many of which are redundant in terms of gene copy number or function . it has been hypothesized that the redundancy evolves under selection , driven by its impacts on growth rate . however , we lack empirical measurements of the fitness costs and benefits of redundancies . our results indicate both positive and negative selection on redundant in translation components , depending on a species’ evolutionary history with feasts and famines .
the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a step change in the scale of sequencing data , with more genomes of SARS-CoV-2 having been sequenced than any other organism on earth . these sequences reveal key insights when represented as a phylogenetic tree , which captures the evolutionary history of the virus , and allows the identification of transmission events and the emergence of new variants . however , existing web-based tools for exploring phylenies do not scale to the size of datasets now available for the first time .
RNA molecules are localized to specific subcellular regions through interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) . to determine transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells , we used our recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique , Halo-seq . we found that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5′ UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization to the basal pole of these cells . in both cell types , the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the RNA-binding protein LARP1 , was abolished upon perturbation of the kinesin-1 , and was reduced upon inhibition of kinase . these findings indicate that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations .
aging is often associated with a loss of cell type identity that results in an increase in transcriptional noise in aged tissues . if this phenomenon reflects a fundamental property of aging remains an open question . the diverse computational methods used for the quantification of age-related loss of cellular identity have prevented reaching meaningful conclusions by direct comparison of existing scRNAseq datasets . to address these issues we created Decibel , a Python toolkit that implements side-to-side four commonly used methods for quantitative quantitative quantitative aging data .
we utilise clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq; Wholistic Interrogation of Lineage Dynamics by sequencing , in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) to understand response and resistance to therapy , including BET bromodomain inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy . these analyses revealed oxidative stress protection by NRF2 as a major mechanism of taxanine resistance and led to the discovery that our tumour models are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation therapy using the clinical stage drug L-asparaginase after frontline treatment with docetaxel . this analysis revealed that our tumor models were collaterally operative in patients and pin points asparagene bioavailability as druggable vulnerability . however , identifying the characteristics of such lineages that underpin resistance to chemotherapy has remained challenging .
DMRT1 loss-of-function has been described in two mammalian species and induces different phenotypes : Disorders of Sex Development ( 46 , XY DSD ) in men and male infertility in mice . we thus abolished DMt1 expression by CRISPR/Cas9 in a third species of mammal , the rabbit . first , we observed that gonads from Xy DMT1/ rabbit fetuses differentiated like ovaries , showing that mrt is involved in testis determination , which heads the testicular genetic cascade . in addition , our data support the potential involvement of mutations in different human pathologies , such as disorders of sex development as well as male and female infer
lipid homeostasis induced by high-fat diet ( HFD ) is a multi-factorial disease including genetic , physiological , behavioral , and environmental components . this study demonstrates that CTPS is crucial in regulating body weight and starvation resistance in Drosophila by functioning in the fat body . a dominant-negative form of CTPS also prevented adipocyte expansion and lipid accumulation , by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-SREBP axis . CTPS elongates cytoophidia , which are found in bacteria , archaea , or eukaryotes . however , depleting CTPS in the body prevented HFD-induced obesity , including body weight gain , adipose expansion , as well as lipogenic genes . our findings highlight the potential role of a CTPS manipulation in the treatment of obesity .
in the classical model , nodals elicit signaling by binding to a complex comprising Type I/II Activin receptors ( Acvr ) and the co-receptor Tdgf1 . however , it is currently unclear whether receptor binding can also affect the distribution of Nodals themselves through the embryo , and it is unknown which of the putative Acvre paralogs mediate Nodal signaling in zebrafish . here , we characterize three Type I and four Type II - homologs and show that – except for acvr1c – all receptor-encoding transcripts are maternally deposited and present during embryogenesis . we found that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co- receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of nodal , providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of the signaling .
type I interferon ( IFN-I ) -mediated antiviral responses are central to host defense against viral infections . crucial is the tight and well-orchestrated control of cellular decision-making leading to the production of iFN-is . to challenge this dogma , we addressed the influence of various stochastic and deterministic host-intrinsic factors on dictating early IFN -I responses , using a murine fibroblast reporter model . we provided evidence for transient heritability driving responder fates , which was verified with mathematical modeling . the classical Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test influenced the percentage of responding cells , similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing . this system immunology approach opens up new avenues to progress the fundamental understanding on cellular decisions-making during early
microtubules ( MTs ) are built from -/-tubulin dimers and used as tracks by kinesin and dynein motors to transport a variety of cargos within the cell . tubulins are subjected to several post-translational modifications ( PTM ) . however , very little is known about the specific modifications found on the different tubuline isotypes in vivo . in this study , we found that in Drosophila ovaries , glutamylated microtubulations occurred clearly on the C-terminal ends of tub84B and Tub67C ( tob84D ) and with this for the proper localization of ooplasmic streaming , depend on TTLL5 , too , suggesting a causative pathway .
the development of multiple chromosome-scale reference genome sequences in many taxonomic groups has yielded a high-resolution view of the patterns and processes of molecular evolution . however , leveraging information across multiple genomes remains a significant challenge in nearly all eukaryotic systems . these challenges range from studying the evolution of chromome structure , to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci , and testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation . here , we present GENESPACE , which addresses these challenges by integrating conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomics . we demonstrate this utility by dissecting presence–absence , copy-number , as well as structural variation at three levels of biological organization : spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex evolution , across the diversity of the Poaceae ( grass ) plant family , among 26 maize cultivars ; whereas the methods to build and visualize syntenic orthologie in the gen
we show that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition . we found that as a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species , that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture . this is due to interactions between growth , metabolism , and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa . when grown in vivo , both species can co-exist . however , little is known about how growth environment could influence the coexistence of these bacterial species in the literature .
background : the quantity and complexity of data being generated and published in biology has increased substantially , but few methods exist for capturing knowledge about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions between diverse groups of species , in such a way that is amenable to data-driven biology and research . to improve access to this knowledge , we have constructed a framework for the curation of the scientific literature studying interspecies interactions , using data curated for the Pathogen–Host Interactions database ( PHI-base ) as a case study.materials and methods : this framework provides a curation tool , phenophtype ontology , and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen–host interaction data , at the level of the host , pathogen , strain , gene , or genotype.results:the framework provides an a
sequence variation in enhancers that control cell-type-specific gene transcription contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations . however , it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor ( TF ) binding and/or activity . we find that genetic variants located within the central region are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity , including sequences flanking core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD TFs . these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific transcription factor binding and activity to date .
dynein activating adaptor ninein-like ( NINL ) has evolved under recurrent positive ( diversifying ) selection , particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region . we demonstrate that proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses cleave and disrupt the neoplasmic function in a host- and virus-specific manner . here , we leverage these genetic signatures to identify a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and as a target of viral antagonism .
background : actin isoforms organize into distinct networks that are essential for the normal function of eukaryotic cells . despite a high level of sequence and structure conservation , subtle differences in their design principles determine the interaction with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins . therefore , identifying how the structure of actin relates to function is important for our understanding of normal cytoskeletal physiology.materials and methods : we report the high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle -actin ( 3 . 37  ) , cardiac muscle - - actin ( 2 . 99 ).results:the structures revealed iso-specific conformations of the N-terminus that shift closer to the filament surface upon myosesin binding . in the mg2+ADP state with their native post-translational modifications , the structures revealed general principles , similarities , and differences between actin structures . the structures of single-isotype , post
transgenic Arrays Resulting in Diversity of Integrated Sequences ( TARDIS ) is a simple yet powerful approach to large-scale transgenesis that overcomes typical limitations encountered in multicellular systems . we demonstrate the power of this system using engineered , split selectable , engineered sites in Caenorhabditis elegans to generate ( 1 ) a large set of individually barcoded lineages and ( 2 ) transcriptional reporter lines from predefined promoter libraries . in principle the process is adaptable to any system where experimentally generated genomic loci landing pads and diverse, heritable DNA elements can be generated . this approach increases transformation yields up to approximately 1000-fold over current single-step methods . here , we present transgenic arrays resulting in diversity of integrating sequence libraries , followed by inducible extraction and integration of individual sequences/library components from the larger library cassette into engineered genomic sites . however , the need for library transgenesis has effectively restricted these approaches to single-cell models .
outer membrane proteins ( OMPs ) of gram-negative bacteria undertake an eventful journey beginning in the cytosol . these helpers usually associate , often transiently , forming large protein assemblies . they are not well understood due to experimental challenges in capturing and characterizing protein-protein interactions , especially transient ones . utilizing AF2Complex , we introduce a high-throughput , deep learning pipeline to identify proteins within the Escherichia coli cell envelope and apply it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway . this work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions .
neuroligins , trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules , regulate both DA neuron connectivity and neurotransmission . however , the contribution of their major interaction partners , neurexins ( Nrxns ) , is unexplored . here , we tested the hypothesis that no neuron axons act as regulators of the functional connectivity of DA neurons and their neurochemical identity are unknown .
mobile health ( mHealth ) interventions , which require ownership of mobile phones , are being investigated throughout Africa . we estimate the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 africa countries , identify a relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic ( HC ) , and quantify inequities in ownership.methodswe use nationally representative data collected in 2017–2018 from 44 , 224 individuals in Round 7 of the Afrobarometer surveys.resultswe find 82% of individuals in 33 countries own mobile phone: 42% BPs and 40% SPs . individuals who live close to an HC have higher odds of ownership than those who do not ( aOR: 1 . 31 , Bayesian 95% highest posterior density [HPD] region: 2 . 22–3 . 18 ) and , amongst mobile phone owners , nearly three times the odds of owning an SP .
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) antibodies are known to be associated with increased protection against future infection . however , variation in antibody levels and risk factors for lower antibody levels following each round of sARS-coV-2 vaccination have not been explored across a wide range of socio-demographic , spike , and health factors within population-based cohorts . using multivariable logistic regression models , we tested associations between antibodies following vaccination and: ( 1 ) ) health , socio , or sociodemographic antibodies after first , second and third anti-Spike antibodies ; ( 2 ) infection following vaccination ( s).resultsin 9361 individuals from TwinsUK and ALSPAC , single-vaccinated individuals with the lowest 20% of antibodies at initial testing had threefold greater odds of having antibodies in the lowest 10% ( OR = 2 . 9 , 95% CI: 1 . 4 , 6 . 0 ) than in the top 20% . in twinsUK , individuals identified as at increased risk of co
