lung-resident mesenchymal stem and stromal cells ( MSCs ) are key elements of the alveolar niche and fundamental regulators of homeostasis and regeneration . we interrogated their function during virus-induced lung injury using the highly prevalent respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) which causes severe outcomes in infants . remarkably , RSV-infection of pediatric LR-MSCs led to a robust activation , characterized by a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory phenotype combined with mediators related to T cell function . in line with this , following in vivo infection , the global transcriptional response appears to follow RSV disease , switching from an early antivirally signature to repair mechanisms including differentiation , tissue remodeling , and angiogenesis .
background : Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is endemic in south Sudan , where outbreaks occur frequently . pregnant women are considered particularly vulnerable for developing complications of VL disease , including opportunistic infections . there is limited evidence available about clinical aspects and treatment outcomes of a cohort of pregnant women with VL.methods:we conducted a retrospective analysis using routine programme data from a MSF health facility in Lankien , Jonglei State , South Sudan between Oct 2014 and April 2018 . records were extracted of women diagnosed with Vl while pregnant , and those symptomatic during pregnancy but diagnosed during the first two weeks postpartum . we included 113 women with vL in pregnancy and 223 non-pregnant women of reproductive age ( 15–45 years ) with V
a high burden of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi ( S . Typhi ) bacteremia has been reported from urban informal settlements in sub-Saharan Africa , yet little is known about the introduction of these strains to the region . understanding regional differences in the predominant strains of S , Typhi can provide insight into the genomic epidemiology . we genetically characterized 310 S - Typhi isolates from typhoid fever surveillance conducted over a 12-year period ( 2007–2019 ) in Kibera , an urban informal colon in Nairobi , Kenya , to assess the circulating strains , their antimicrobial resistance attributes , and how they relate to global S : 290 ( 93 . 5% ) isolates with a median of 14 allelic differences ( range 0–52 ) and consisted entirely of genotypes 4 . 3 . 1 and 4 , 3 , 1 . 2 .
severe Acute Respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 ( sARS-CoV-2 ) is the third novel -coronavirus to cause significant human mortality in the last two decades . although vaccines are available , too few have been administered worldwide to keep the virus in check and to prevent mutations leading to immune escape . to determine if antibodies could be identified with universal corona virus activity , plasma from convalescent subjects was screened for IgG against a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-coV-2 spike S2 domain , which is highly conserved between human  koronal antibodies ( hmAbs ) tested ( Beta , Gamma , Delta , Epsilon , and Omicron ) . from these subjects , several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies were developed that neutralized S
the yeast Candida parapsilosis metabolizes these compounds via the 3-oxoadipate and gentisate pathways , whose components are encoded by two metabolic gene clusters . in this study , we determine the chromosome level assembly of the C . parapsesis strain CLIB214 and use it for transcriptomic and proteomic investigation of cells cultivated on hydroxyaromatic substrates.materials and methodswe demonstrate that the genes coding for enzymes and plasma membrane transporters involved in this process are highly upregulated and their expression is controlled in a substrate-specific manner . we also show that putative transcriptional factors encoded in the genes OTF1 and GTF1 located within these gene cluster , function as transcriptional activators of the three otf1p-lacking mutant , which exhibit impaired growth on 4-hydroxybenzoates , but still utilizes hydroxybenzenes , are also accompanied by upregulation of genes for the enzymes involved in -oxidation of fatty acids and glyoxylate cycle , amino acid metabolism , and peroxisome biogenesis
we develop a method called “oracle-supervised Neural Engineering Framework” ( osNEF ) to train biologically-detailed spiking neural networks that realize a variety of cognitively-relevant dynamical systems . we train networks to perform computations that are commonly found in cognitive systems ( communication , multiplication , harmonic oscillation , and gated working memory ) using four distinct neuron models ( leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons , Izhikevich neurons , 4-dimensional nonlinear point neurons and 4-compartment , 6-ion-channel layer-V pyramidal cell reconstructions ) connected with various synaptic models . the baseline performance and forgetting rate of the model are consistent with animal data from delayed match-to-sample tasks ( DMTST ) : we observe a baseline performance of 95% and exponential forgetting with time constant  = 2 . 4  71s .
we performed a meta-analysis integrating the differential expression ( DE ) analyses of all publicly available transcriptomic datasets , both in human and mouse , comparing trisomic and euploid transcriptomes from different sources . we found that genome wide deregulation as a consequence of trisomy 21 is not arbitrary , but involves deregulation of specific molecular cascades in which both HSA21 genes and HSA 21 interactors are more consistently deregulated compared to other genes . the most consistent changes are enriched in interferon related categories and neutrophil activation , reinforcing the concept that DS is an inflammatory disease . most of these events of “co-deregulation” involve genes belonging to the same GO category , and genes associated with the same disease class . in fact , gene deregulation happens in “clusters” , so that groups from 2 to 13 genes are found consistently deregulation , even though the triplicated genes are the same
evoked responses are two main types of neuronal activity obtained with diverse electrophysiological recordings ( EEG/MEG/iEEG/LFP ) . although typically studied separately , they might in fact be closely related . we validated this mechanism using computational modelling and analysis of a large EEG data set . with a biophysical model , we indeed demonstrated that intracellular currents in the neuron are asymmetric and , consequently , the mean of alpha oscillations is non-zero . in order to explain a complex relationship between the dynamics of amplitude-envelope and corresponding baseline shifts , additional simulations with simple oscillators coupled with different time delays may obscure macroscopic estimation of the alpha rhythm modulation .
the crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus ( CCHFV ) is a tick-borne virus that can cause a cd fever in humans , with a case fatality rate of up to 40% . we used RNA-Seq in two human liver cell lines ( HepG2 and Huh7 ) infected with the virus , to examine kinetic changes in host expression and viral replication simultaneously at 1 and 3 days post infection . through this , numerous host pathways were identified that were modulated by the virus including: antiviral response and endothelial cell leakage . this has been associated with the TLR9 signalling cascade , and polymorphisms in the cytosolic component of the RIG-I signalling pathway and OAS2 were both shown to be dysregulated .
background : working memory ( WM ) deficits have been widely documented in schizophrenia ( SZ ) , and almost all existing studies attributed the deficit to decreased capacity as compared to healthy control ( HC ) subjects . recent developments in WM research suggest that other components , such as precision , also mediate behavioral performance . it remains unclear how different WM components jointly contribute to deficits in schizophrenia.methods:we measured the performance of 60 SZ ( 31 females ) and 61 HC ( 29 female ) in a classical delay-estimation visual working memory task and evaluated several influential computational models proposed in basic science of VWM to disentangle the effect of various memory components.results:the model assuming variable precision ( VP ) across items and trials is the best model to explain the performance
the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein ( Env ) mediates viral entry via conformational changes associated with binding the cell surface receptor and coreceptor ( CCR5/CXCR4 ) , resulting in subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes . although the gp120 Env surface subunit has been extensively studied for its role in viral entry and evasion of the host immune response , the viral transmembrane glycoprotein and its roles in natural infection are less well characterized . here , we identified a primary HIV-1 Env variant that consistently supports >300% increased viral infectivity in the presence of autologous or heterologous HIV-positive plasma . we demonstrate that this phenotype is restored through the binding of host antibodies . in the absence of HIV-negative plasma , viruses with this Env consistently supports a decrease in viral infection that was not due to decreased CD4 binding .
the development of methods for the identification of cancer consensus molecular subtypes is essential . the lack of intuitive and easy-to-use analytical tools has posed a barrier . here , we report on the developing of the COnsensus Molecular SUbtype of Cancer ( COMSUC ) web server .

the seabird tick ( Ixodes uriae ) , a highly diverse and ecologically important group of ectoparasitic blood-feeding organisms , is widely distributed around the circumpolar regions of the northern and southern hemispheres . this profound biographic subdivision provides a unique opportunity to determine whether viruses associated with ticks exhibit the same evolutionary patterns as their hosts . to test this , we collected migratory birds from a Gentoo penguin ( Pygoscelis papua ) colony near Bonden island , northern Sweden . through meta-transcriptomic next-generation sequencing we identified 16 RNA viruses , seven of which were novel . we identified the same species , the Razorbill ( Alca torda , and the Common murre ( Uria aalge ) in both regions indicating that there have been at least two cross-circumpolar dispersal events , including Gadgets Gully virus , Taggert virus and Okhotskiy virus . in contrast , our phylogenetic analysis revealed no movement of the Ix .
meiotic recombination is an essential biological process that ensures faithful chromosome segregation and promotes parental allele shuffling . here we present RecombineX ( https://github . com/yjx1217/Recombinex ) , a generalized computational framework that automates the full workflow of marker identification , gamete genotyping , and tetrad-based recomination profiling based on any organism or genetic background with batch processing capability . furthermore , our re-analysis of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii revealed two unusual structural rearrangement events that were not noticed before , which exemplify the occasional genome instability triggered by meiosis .
the APOBEC3 ( A3 ) genes encode cytidine deaminase proteins with potent antiviral and anti-retroelement activity . this locus is characterized by duplication , recombination , and deletion events that gave rise to the seven A3s found in primates . the most potent of the A3 proteins against HIV-1 is A3G . in order to test whether superior restriction factors could be created by genetically linking single A3 domains into synthetic double domains , we linked A3C and A3H single domains in novel combinations .
we provide a proof-of-principle synthetic supervised learning method , TumE , that integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks , to infer ongoing selection in bulk-sequenced single tumour biopsies . this extensible framework provides a foundation and future directions for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and , in turn , the cancer patient . we show how transfer learning can leverage stored knowledge within Tume models for related evolutionary inference tasks , reducing data and computational time for further model development and providing a library of recyclable deep learning models for the cancer evolution community .

background : hybridization occurs between certain Schistosoma species that can cause important public health and veterinary issues . recent genomic evidence indicates that some species show signatures of genomic introgression from S . bovis . here , we conducted a genomic comparative study and investigated the genomic relationships between . haematobium , S , and their hybrids using 19 isolates originating from a wide geographical range over Africa . we developed 56 , 181 SNPs that allowed a clear differentiation of S - bovis isolates from . a natural . hibridolysin gene that has been previously detected in some introgressed populations from niger . the observed introgression is unidirectional . this study highlights the fact that introgression of the observed homogeneity between the isolates is widespread across .
immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) vaccines have not been successful in clinical trials . we coupled Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) imaging and fluorescent microscopy of 64Cu-labeled , photoactivatable-GFP HIV and fluorescently labeled dimeric IgA to determine how dIgA antibodies influence virus interaction with mucosal barriers and viral penetration in colorectal tissue . our results show that HIV virions rapidly disseminate throughout the colon two hours after exposure , and the presence of d

background : two-component , self-assembling nanoparticles represent a versatile platform for multivalent presentation of viral antigens . computationally designed tetrahedral , octahedrale , and icosahedal nanoparticul immunogens were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanop article . a number of analyses , including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM , demonstrated that the nanopartikel immunogen possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties . we describe detailed antigenic , structural , or functional characterization of computationally design , computationally crafted , multimerization concepts in immunization strategies where the goal is to improve the induction and maturation of neutralizing antibody lineages.materials and methods : in this review , we describe the antigenic and functional characteristics of a novel multimerized antibody lineage displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein ( Env ) ectodomains , capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer
Pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) has evolved various immune evasion mechanisms that target host antiviral responses . however , it is unclear whether and how PRV encoded proteins modulate the cGAS-STING axis for immune elucidation . here , we show that PRv tegument protein UL13 inhibits STING-mediated antivirally signaling via regulation of STING stability . subsequently , mutant PRV lacking ul13 impaired in antagonism of type I IFNs and shows attenuated pathogenicity in mice . in addition , a novel mechanism by targeting STING to persistently evade host immune responses triggered by PRV infection .
the impact of temperature on arthropod-borne viruses ( arboviruses ) genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection , however , is poorly understood . therefore , we determined how constant extrinsic incubation temperatures of 25°C , 28°C and 32°C control Zika virus ( ZIKV ) vector competence and population dynamics within both Aedes species . we also examined fluctuating temperatures which better mimic field conditions in the tropics . utilizing RNA-seq to characterize Zika virus population structure , our results demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on the selective environment in unexpected ways .
we find that the presence of a repulsive odorant , 2-nonanone , that signals threat strongly blocks the attraction of other odorants , such as isoamyl alcohol ( IAA ) or benzaldehyde that signal food , played a critical role in the integration process . utilizing a forward genetic screen , we found that genes known to regulate the structure and function of sensory neurons , osm-5 and ochm-1 , play a crucial role in this complex olfactory task .
extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are protein-loaded nano-scaled particles that are extracellularly released by eukaryotes and prokaryote . for evaluating the immune-protective role of Schistosoma mansoni ( egg ) egg -derived VEsicles against murine schistosomiasis , EV was isolated from cultured eggs by progressive sequential cooling ultra-centrifugation technique . results showed significant reduction of tegumentally deranged adult worms ( hepatic and intestinal egg counts reduction by 46 . 58% , 95% , 14% and 93 . 17% respectively ; accompanied by remarkable amelioration of sizes , numbers and histopathological parameters . in conclusion , the present study highlighted the role of eg - derived vs .
background : mycetoma is considered a neglected tropical disease globally . however , data on its burden and the associated complications in Uganda are limited . Hence we aimed to estimate its burden in Uganda.materials and methods : a systematic PubMed search for all studies of any design on mycetma in Uganda without restriction to the year of publication was conducted.results:a retrospective review of all the biopsy reports at the Pathology Reference Laboratory , Department of Pathology , Makerere University , Kampala , Uganda from January 1950 to September 2019 was conducted , with 249 additional cases identified by review of biopsy reports ( total of 279 cases ) . the average incidence was estimated at 0 . 32/100 , 000 persons and prevalence of 8 .
the aim of Malaysia to eliminate malaria nationwide by 2020 seems need to be prolonged . the epidemiological study of simian malaria in primates provides useful information in identifying the risk of human-macaques Plasmodium infection . this systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to select appropriate articles as references . data searches were performed through international databases such as Google Scholar , PubMed , CrossRef , Scopus , Web of Science and Science Direct for original articles published from 2000 until 2021 .
latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is strongly associated with several malignancies , including B-cell lymphomas and epithelial tumors . EBNA1 is a key antigen expressed in all EBV-associated tumors during latency that is required for maintenance of the EBV episome DNA and the regulation of viral gene transcription . however , the mechanism utilized by EBV to maintain latent infection at the levels of posttranslational regulation remains largely unclear.
WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 ( WAPO-A1 ) is a leading candidate gene for this QTL . utilizing mutants and transgenic plants , we demonstrate in this study that WAPO1 is the causal gene underpinning this . we found three widespread haplotypes in the QTL region ( H1 , H2 and H3 ) , each associated with particular WAPO - A1 alleles . the 115-bp deletion in the promoter is expressed at significantly lower levels in the developing spikes than the allele in the H1 haplotyps , resulting in reduced SNS and GNS ( H2>H3>H1).resultswe found that the wapo-B1 allerele is associated with the strongest effects in increasing spikelet number per spike ( SNS ) and a smaller terminal spikelet than the wild type .
background : Scrub typhus is an emerging vector-borne zoonosis , caused by Orientia spp . and transmitted by larvae of trombiculid mites , called chiggers . it mainly occurs within a region of the Asia-Pacific called the tsutsugamushi triangle , where rodents are known as the most relevant hosts for the trombiculide vector . however , the reservoir ( s ) and vectors of the scrub type in southern Chile are unknown . the disease has recently been discovered on and is considered endemic for Chiloé Island . this study firstly reports the presence of different rodent-associated mite pools positive for the genus Herpetacarus , in probable sites for the transmission of orientiae responsible for scrub typiques on chiloe Island in south America.materials and methods : a total of 4 , 713 trap-night , 244 rodent species were captured : the most abundant was Abrothrix olivacea .
background : during the 2015–2017 Zika epidemic , dengue and chikungunya–two other viral diseases with the same vector as Zika–were also in circulation . clinical presentation of these diseases can vary from person to person in terms of symptoms and severity , making it difficult to differentially diagnose them . despite the importance of surveillance data for informing epidemiological analyses , our aim was to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic.methods:using basic principles of probability and empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity , we generated revised estimates of reported cases of Zika that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation with or without laboratory confirmation.results:a total of 944 , 700 ( 95% CrI: 884 , 900–996 , 400 ) Zika cases occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using molecular methods versus 608 ,400 ( 955% Cr
a pregenomic ( pg ) RNA intermediate in hepatocytes is an enveloped DNA virus that replicates its DNA genome via reverse transcription of the adipose . the biogenesis and molecular characteristics of serum HBV RNA remain to be fully defined . in this study , we found that the encapsidated serum RNA predominately consists of cccDNA , which are detergent- and ribonuclease-resistant . we demonstrated that the cell culture supernatant contains a large amount of nonenveloped capsids and a minor population of virions . furthermore , the egress , in a similar way as DNA-virion-like particle as spliced and poly ( A )-free serum ( a) -free ) microscopy , can be detected in virus-like particles in chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) patient serum and has been utilized as a biomarker for intrahepatic c
mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) is a major public health concern , exacerbated by the emergence of drug-resistant TB . to combat the host’s dynamic environment , Mtb encodes multiple DNA repair enzymes that play a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity . therefore , we investigated the biological impact of deleting UDGs in the adaptation of pathogen . we generated gene replacement mutants of uracil DNA glycosylases , individually ( rvung , RvudgB ) or together ( Rv ) . the double KO mutant exhibited higher spontaneous mutation rate in guinea pigs and accumulated large number of SNPs as revealed by whole-genome sequence analysis . a subset of these drives adaptation in the host .
the biological master clock , suprachiasmatic nucleus ( of rat and mouse ) , is composed of 10 , 000 clock cells which are heterogeneous with respect to their circadian periods . despite this inhomogeneity , an intact SCN maintains a very good degree of circadian phase ( time ) coherence which is vital for sustaining various circadian rhythmic activities , and it is supposedly achieved by not just one but a few different cell-to-cell coupling mechanisms , among which action potential -mediated connectivity is known to be essential . here we exhaustively and systematically explore a large pool of various network morphologies to come up with plausible network features of SCN networks .
to characterize the functional role of the left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex during reading in a quantitatively explicit and testable manner , we propose the lexical categorization model ( LCM ) . the LCM assumes that lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filtering out orthographic strings without meaning . we found that word-likeness , assumed as input into a vocal catalyzed process , is represented posteriorly to lviOT , whereas a dichotomous word/non-word output of the lCM could be localized to the downstream frontal brain regions .
the circadian clock exerts significance influence on the immune system and disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to inflammatory pathologies . shift work is associated with impairment in immune function , and those alterations are sex-specific . the goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms that explain the weakened immune system in shift workers . to achieve that goal , we have constructed a mathematical model of the mammalian pulmonary clock coupled to an acute inflammation model in the male and female rats . we identify REV-ERB as a key modulator of interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) , an anti-inflammatory cytokine . this model reproduces the clock gene expression in the lung and the immune response to various doses of lipopolysaccharide .
background : dengue fever virus ( DENV ) infection is one of the most common vector-borne tropical diseases . in this study , we estimated the cost of illness ( COI ) in Saudi Arabia in the period 2013–2017 , by processing national data including all declared cases recorded in referral centers in the western region , being the endemic region of the country.methods:a statistically validated predictive model that was built on a representative sample of 717 laboratory-confirmed cases of DENV infection , direct costs , due to care-related expenditures , were estimated using the human capital model based on gross domestic product adjusted for invalidity duration.results:the total DENV COI for the five years was estimated as US$551 . 0 Million for a total 15 , 369 patients out of 25 , 745 declared cases , resulting in an average cost of US$11 947 . 6 by patient.conclusions:in this study we estimated COI in a period 2013-2017 .
the function of stored fat in the nucleus has not been determined , and it is possible that nuclear lipid droplets may instead be deleterious by disrupting nuclear organization or triggering aggregation of hydrophobic proteins . to increase the normal , low frequency of nucleic lipid drops in wild-type animals , we used a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants with abnormally large or abundant nuclear fatty droplets . we show here that nuclear nuclear phosphorylation of copa-1 mutants results from a defect in retrieving mislocalized membrane proteins that normally reside in the endoplasmic reticulum . the nuclear membrane protein NEMP-1/nemp1/TMEM194A is a component of COPI vesicles .
streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and many survivors develop neurological sequelae after the acute infection has resolved , possibly due to neuronal damage . here , we studied mechanisms for pneumococcal interactions with neurons . utilizing human primary neurons , pull-down experiments and mass spectrometry , our results show that pneumacocci interact with the cytoskeleton protein -actin through the pilus-1 adhesin RrgA- and cytotoxin pneumolysin ( Ply ) , thereby promoting adhesion and invasion of neurons.resultsa total of 58 neurons were infected with pneumocytes expressing the pil-1 adh
physiologically , how the fighting behavior is controlled remains unknown . utilizing the fighting fish Betta splendens , we studied behavioral and brain-transcriptomic changes during the fight between the two opponents . at the behavioral level , surface-breathing , and biting/striking occurred only during intervals between mouth-locking . the behaviors of the two opposing opponents became synchronized , with each pair showing a unique behavioral pattern . we examined the expression patterns of 23 , 306 brain transcripts using RNA-sequencing data from brains of fighting pairs after a 20-min ( D20 ) and a 60-min fight .
we identified a new strain of the Omono River virus ( OmRV ) , and determined high-resolution structures for this virus using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy . the structures feature an unexpected protrusion at the five-fold vertex of the capsid . all these structures , together with some biological results , suggest the protruders’ associations with the extracellular transmission of the virus . here , we identified the aforementioned , totivirus-like viruses , with features similar to those of the Totiviridae family .
mTOR , a serine/threonine protein kinase that is involved in a series of critical cellular processes , can be found in two functionally distinct complexes . in contrast to morc1 , little is known about the mechanisms that regulate mtc2 . here we show that mtoc2 activity is reduced in mice with a hypomorphic mutation of the Ric-8B gene . we found that a high conserved protein that acts as a non-canonical guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for heterotrimeric Gs/olf type subunits , fail to close the neural tube in the cephalic region and die during mid-embryogenesis .
the ensemble forecast system based on a susceptible-infected-recovered type of compartmental model coupled with a data assimilation method called the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter ( EAKF ) is constructed to generate real-time forecasts of dengue fever spread dynamics . to account for the dramatic variations of outbreak size in different seasons , the effective population size parameter that is sequentially updated to adjust the predicted outbreak scale is introduced into the model . the proposed forecast model generates accurate projections of peak timing , peak intensity , and total incidence , outperforming a generalized additive model approach .
[ purpose ] the current study aimed to develop and pilot an intervention to strengthen individual and family resilience against leprosy-related discrimination . [ subjects and methods ] we used a quasi-experimental , before-after study design with a mixed methods approach . the 10-week family-based intervention was designed to strengthen the resilience of individuals and families by enhancing their protective abilities and capacity to overcome adversity.results:the study was conducted in two sites , urban areas in Telangana state and in rural areas in Odisha state , India . there was a significant increase in CD-RISC scores post-intervention for persons affected and their family members from a few weeks after completion of the intervention .
in budding yeast , the conserved protein shugoshin ( Sgo1 ) contributes to biorientation by recruiting the protein phosphatase PP2A-Rts1 and the condensin complex to centromeres . utilizing peptide prints , we identified a Serine-Rich Motif ( SRM ) of Sgo1, which mediates the interaction with condensesin and is essential for centromeric condesin recruitment and the establishment of bi orientation . we show that the interaction is regulated via phosphorylation within the SRM and we determined the phospho-sites using mass spectrometry .
the ability of currently available tools to predict T cell epitope candidates has not been comprehensively evaluated . in this study , we used a recently published dataset that systematically defined vaccinia virus ( VACV ) infected C57BL/6 mice ( expressing H-2Db and H-2Kb ) , considering both peptides predicted to bind MHC or experimentally eluted from infecated cells , making this the most comprehensive dataset of T cells mapped in a complex pathogen . we found that all methods were able to improve epitopic identification above random , with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data . this benchmark was implemented in an open and easy to reproduce format , providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools .
spermatozoal DNA methylation is an unlikely mediator of intergenerational effects of metabolic traits . it is unclear , however , whether this differential gene methylations is reflected in sperm . we profiled genome-wide DNA-methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array in a cross-sectional study of matched human blood and sperme from lean and obese males to analyse tissue covariation of genetic methylomic signatures , and identify obesity-associated methylomes . a single cross-tissue obesity-specific hypermethylated site ( cg19357369; chr4:2429884; P = 8 . 95  108; 2% ) was identified , warranting replication and further investigation .
neurotropic reovirus disseminates through neural routes and invades the central nervous system ( CNS ) to cause lethal encephalitis in newborn animals . to define mechanisms of revirus neuronal entry and directional transport , we used primary neuron cultures , which reproduce in vivo infection patterns displayed by different neuron serotypes . treatment of neurons with small-molecule inhibitors of different endocytic uptake pathways allowed us to discover that the cellular machinery mediating macropinocytosis is required for a retrograde but only limited anterograde neuronale transmission . further analysis of viral transport revealed that multiple virions are transported together in axons within non-acidified vesicles , where disassembly of Virions and release of the viral core into the cytoplasm initiate replication . the dynamics of retrograde re
objective . to identify a previously unidentified conserved epitope on Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) that could be targeted by prophylactic antibodies and exploited in structure-based vaccine design.materials and methods . seven monoclonal antibodies to the C-terminal domain of CSP ( ctCSP ) were expressed and characterized from volunteers immunized with RTS , S/AS01 . the antibodies target two different sites on opposite faces of the -ctcSP , whereas antibodies to a  c-site showed very limited cross reactivity with a diverse panel of peptides whose sequences were derived from field isolates of P . falcip
lysine malonylation is a post-translational modification ( PTM ) , which regulates many cellular processes . yet , insights into such variations are needed to understand how to contribute to the differences in the virulence and repertoire of virulent factors between toxoplasma gondii genotypes . in this study , we profiled l - tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) and immuno-affinity purification . this analysis was performed on three T . godii strains with distinctive pathogenicity in mice , including RH strain ( type I , PRU , and VEG strain ; 50 proteins and 59 sites were upregulated , 50 protein and 53 sites were downregulated ; and 72 proteins and 90 sites and 7 proteins and 8 sites were reregulated . these results reveal an association between ly
a novel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the nematode pharynx is a potential new drug target . this homomeric receptor is comprise of five non-Î EAT-2 subunits and is not sensitive to existing cholinomimetic anthelmintics . we found that EAT-18 , an auxiliary subunit protein , is essential for functional expression of the receptor , and different homologs alter the pharmacological properties . thus we have described not only the novel potential drug target but also a new type of obligate auxiliary protein for nAChRs .
background : HIV-1 infects CD4 T lymphocytes ( CD4TL ) through binding the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 . however , counterexamples to this paradigm are common , suggesting heterogeneity in the virulence of CXCL4-using viruses.methods:through analysis of thirty envelope glycoproteins ( envs ) from patients at different stages of infection , mostly treatment-nave , we first interrogated whether sensitivity of viruses to inhibition by CxCL12 varies over time in infection.results:in vitro , RES viruses are frequent in patients experiencing low levels of HIV-1 , most often late in infection . we finally asked whether the low CD4t levels in patients are related to increased pathogenicity of RES virus . sensitivity to soluble CD4 or broadly neutralizing antibodies further showed that RES Envs adopt a more closed conformation with distinct antigenicity compared to RES-sensitive ( SENS )
a 12-week controlled interrupted time series study was conducted in two control and one intervention sites containing three hyrax dens each . we measured weekly and 36hrs post-intervention sand fly abundance inside dens using CDC light traps . Next-Generation Sequencing was performed to identify sander fly Leishmania spp . infection . the abundance reduction ( AR ) was calculated using Mulla’s formula and negative binomial regression . after fogging , Phlebotomus was 93% at 36hrs , 18% and 38% at two and five weeks respectively and 41% during the complete period . in the regression models , the density of leishmania infection decreased by 74% ( IRR: 0 . 26 , 95%CI: 0- . 11–0 , 57 ) at five weeks and 82% ( irr = 0.001 ) for the complete post- intervention period , suggesting it could be an effective source-reduction measure for ZCL vectors
background : pseudoknot ( PK ) structures , which are present in a wide range of RNA molecules , are critically important in the regulation of gene expression . the 5′ untranslated region ( 5′ UTR ) of foot-and-mouth disease virus ( FMDV ) vRNA is considerably longer than in other viruses from the picornavirus family and consists of a number of distinctive structural motifs that includes multiple ( 2 , 3 or 4 depending on the virus strain ) putative PKs linked in tandem . here , using bioinformatics , sub-genomic replicons and recombinant viruses we have investigated the structural conservation and importance of the pss in the FMDV lifecycle.materials and methods : this study points to roles for a replicon lacking pcs retaining the ability to replicate , albeit at reduced levels . despite the conservation of two or more p  0.001 , the s and s roles of PK in RNA functions are not fully understood .
background : Praziquantel ( PZQ ) is currently the only recommended drug for infection and disease caused by the schistosome species that infects humans . however , the current tablet formulation is not suitable for pre-school age children mainly due to its bitterness and the large tablet size . this randomized , single-blind , crossover , swill-and-spit palatability study ( nCT02315352 ) was carried out at a single school in Tanzania in children aged 6–11 years old . over 2 days , children were stratified according to age group ( 6–8 years or 9-11 years ) and gender , then randomized to receive each formulation in a pre-specified sequence.results:there was no reported difference in the VASt = 0 between the two orally disintegrating tablet ( ODT ) formulations ( p0 . 106 ) without water on the first day , and the current available PZq 600 mg formulation ( PzQ-Cesol ) dispersed in water and the currently available
drug resistance in viruses represents one of the major challenges of healthcare . as part of an effort to provide a treatment that avoids the possibility of drug resistance , we discovered a novel mechanism of action ( MOA ) and specific compounds to treat all nine human herpesviruses and animal herpeses . this work serves as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the feasibility of a new antiviral target—suppressing pressure-driven viral genome ejection—that is likely impervious to developing drug resistance.
a group of four human inhabited Nancowry Islands in Nicobar district in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , India having a population of 7674 is the lone focus of diurnally sub-periodic Wuchereria bancrofti ( DspWB ) that is transmitted by Aedes niveus ( Ludlow ) . Molecular xenomonitoring ( MX ) was conducted to identify appropriate vector sampling method and assess the impact .
cellular USP12 interacts with the HAT domain of CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) and inhibits CBP’s acetyltransferase activity . however , cell-intrinsic inhibitors of CBP are poorly defined . here , we found that cellular , interferon- ( IFN ) antiviral signaling positively regulates a cytoplasmic , nucleal , and nucleotide , thereby inhibits the dephosphorylation effects of TCPTP on p-STAT1 , which finally maintains nuclear phosphorylated STAT1 levels and IFN antivirally efficacy .
we report the identification of two orthobunyaviruses , Melao virus ( MELV ) and Oropouche virus ( OROV ) , in plasma specimens from Haitian children with acute febrile illness who presented during outbreaks caused by alpha- and flavi viruses in 2014 . heretofore not described as a human pathogen , MELV was isolated in cell culture from the plasma of five case patients , using an unbiased sequencing approach , with phylogenetic inference suggesting a close relationship with strains from Brazil.
the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sARS-CoV-2 ) is a major target for the COVID-19 vaccine . to quickly respond to the outbreak of the SARS-coV-2 pandemic , a nucleic acid-based vaccine is an emerging option , beyond the traditional inactivated virus vaccine or recombinant protein vaccine.a DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation , was codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and then cloned into mammal cell expression vectors , called pSARS-S and psARS2-S , respectively . after immunization , sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses . the spike genes of systolic spike protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after transient expression in HEK293T cells . we found that both , but not , could induce very high levels of antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of
background : there is limited information on health beliefs and health seeking behavior towards MMDP services for lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) in endemic regions of Zambia.methods:this was an exploratory qualitative study conducted with community members including LF patients , community health workers and healthcare providers . data was collected through a series of four focus group discussions stratified by sex and 26 in-depth interviews.results:the perceived causes of the chronic manifestations of LF included; contact with animal faeces , use of traditional herbal aphrodisiacs ( mutoto ) , witchcraft and sexual contact with women who were menstruating or had miscarried.conclusions:a total of 26 community members were able to identify any home and facility-based care strategies for lymphoedema . there was limited information about health beliefs , health seeking behaviors towards mrss , msr , and mcds . the perceived cause of chronic manifestation of l - feces included , contact with animals f
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) , which promotes actin filament elongation , is a novel interaction partner of p8 and important for transfer of HTLV-1 Gag to target cells and virus transmission . here , we report that VASP contains an Ena/VASP homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain that targets the protein to focal adhesions . co-immunoprecipitations confirmed interactions of VASP:p8 in 293T , Jurkat and infected MT-2 cells . repression of both endogenous and overexpressed VASP by RNA interference or by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced p-8 transfer to target Jurkat T-cells , while virus release was unaffected . we identified VASP as an important interaction partner for p8, which is important for transposition of t-cell - to -cell transfer . further , deletion of the VASP G- and F-actin binding domains significantly diminished co-precip
objective-driven plasticity-based computational models for tinnitus are usually driven by homeostatic mechanisms , modeled to fit phenomenological findings . the learning algorithm maximizes the network’s output entropy by learning the feed-forward and recurrent interactions in the model . we show that the connectivity patterns and responses learned by the model display several hallmarks of early auditory processing neuronal networks . in this state , the network activity resembles responses to genuine inputs even in the absence of external stimulation , it “hallucinates” auditory responses . here , we demonstrate that attenuation of peripheral inputs drives the network towards its critical point and transition into a tidnia-like state . this model demonstrates how objective - driven plasticity mechanisms that normally act to optimize the network's input representation can also elicit pathologies such as a result of sensory deprivation .
porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus ( PHEV ) is a highly neurotropic coronavirus belonging to the genus Betacorona virus . however , the neuroinvasion route of phEV are poorly understood . here , we found that BALB/c mice are susceptible to intranasal pvh infection and showed distinct neurological manifestations . the behavioral study and histopathological examination revealed that axonal transport may engage in rapid viral transmission in the central nervous system , and olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) were susceptible to viral infection . we identified that pcs invades the CNS via the olefactory nerve and trigeminal nerve located in the nasal cavity , suggesting that viral materials traveling along a xons , leading to inflammatory and immune responses , tissue disorganization and dysfunction in mice . by tracking neuroinvassion , our findings suggest that the pph / ml , p  0.001 ) may serve as a potential prototype for elucidating the path
the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone ( 20E ) upregulated the expression of transcription factor Krüppel-like factor ( identified as Klf15 ) to promote macroautophagy , apoptosis and gluconeogenesis during metamorphosis . the holometabolous lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera , cotton bollworm , as a model , we revealed that 20E via its nuclear receptor EcR upregulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( Pepck ) expression by binding to the KLF binding site ( KLF bs ) in the promoter of Atg8 ( autophagy-related gene 8/LC3 ) , which utiliseffs , free amino acids ( FAAs ] , and glucose levels . however , knockdown of 20E by RNA interference delayed pupation and repressed autophag
the primary immunological target of COVID-19 vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike ( S ) protein . to identify possible antibody binding sites , we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4 . 1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length , fully glycosylated and palmitoyleated S proteins . we find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures , highlighting the importance of structural dynamics . by mapping steric accessibility , structural rigidity , sequence conservation , and generic antibody binding signatures , our novel epitope-mapping procedure is general and should thus prove useful for other viral envelope proteins whose structures have been characterized .
impaired type I interferons ( IFNs ) production or signaling have been associated with severe COVID-19 , further promoting the evaluation of recombinant type I IFN s as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection . in the Syrian hamster model , we show that intranasal administration of IFN- starting one day pre-infection or one day post-infected limited weight loss and decreased viral lung titers . by contrast , late interventions are ineffective , although not associated with signs of enhanced disease .
background : the identification of freshwater snails is usually based on morphology and potentially DNA-based methods , but these have many drawbacks that hamper their use.objectives:this study aims to evaluate MALDI-TOF MS profiling for identification of both frozen and ethanol-stored snail species using protein extracts from different body parts.materials and methods : a total of 530 field specimens belonging to nine species ( Biomphalaria pfeifferi , Bulinus , and Oncomelania ) and 89 laboratory-reared specimens were used for this study . spectral analysis yielded intra-species reproducibility and interspecies specificity which resulted in the correct identification of all the specimens in blind queries , with log-score values greater than 1 . in the second step , we demonstrated that MALD
introduction : food and water-borne illness caused by ingestion of ( oo ) cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia is one of the major health problems globally . several methods are available to detect Giardinia cyst and Cryptosporinidium . most of the available methods require a good laboratory facility and well-trained manpower and are therefore costly . there is a need of affordable and reliable method that can be easily implemented in resource limited settings.methods:a smartphone based microscopic assay method consisting of a ball lens of 1 mm diameter , white LED as illumination source and Lugols's iodine staining provided magnification and contrast capable of distinguishing . a spike recovery experiment performed on cabbage , carrot , cucumber , radish , tomatoes , and water resulted in 26 . 810 . 3 , 40 . 18 . 5 , 44 . 47 . 7 , 17 .
objective : to assess the prevalence status and spatial distribution of human echinococcosis in order to advance our knowledge of basic information for prevention and control measures reinforcement.materials and methods : a total of 47 , 278 cases of a zoonotic parasitic disease were recorded in 2018 in 370 endemic counties in China . the prevalence rate for human agropastoral sector was 10 . 57 per 10 , 000 . spatial scanning analysis revealed two spatial clusters , namely high-high and low-high aggregation modes in local spatial autocorrelation.results:there was a significant increase in the prevalence of the disease in the globle spatial autorelation . in the second category , six types of spatial cluster were observed in the counties of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , and in Sichuan provinces .
background : network-based intervention strategies can be effective and cost-efficient approaches to curtailing harmful contagions in myriad settings . as studied , these strategies are often impractical to implement , as they typically assume complete knowledge of the network structure , which is unusual in practice . in this paper , we investigate how different immunization strategies perform under realistic conditions—where the strategies are informed by partially-observed network data . our results suggest that global immuneization strategies , like degree immmunization , are optimal in most cases ; the exception is at very high levels of missing data , where stochastic strategies are more robust in some cases due to the different ways in which they can be affected by missing data
extracellular recording is an accessible technique used in animals and humans to study the brain physiology and pathology . as the number of recording channels and their density grows it is natural to ask how much improvement the additional channels bring in and how we can optimally use the new capabilities for monitoring the brain.we demonstrate this in the general setting of previously proposed kernel Current Source Density method and illustrate it with simplified examples as well as using evoke potentials from the barrel cortex obtained with a Neuropixels probe and with compatible model data . here we show that for any given distribution of electrodes we can establish exactly what information about current sources in the brain can be recovered and what information is strictly unobservable .
we developed molecular assays for detecting asexual and gametocyte stages of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) , P . vivax ( Pv ) ( p . malariae , and . ovale sp. ( Po ) in a unique epidemiological setting in papua new Guinea . the observed frequency of co-infection with Pf and Pv gamestocytes was higher than expected from individual prevalence rates . this was partially attributable to malaria infections clustering in some villages . however , no general prevailing pattern of suppression or facilitation was identified in pairwise analysis of parasitemia and parasitemia of the four species . in particular , there is limited understanding of between-species interactions .
we proposed a cross-union survival mixture-adjusted mediation test to effectively examine the existence of mediation effect by fitting an empirical three-component mixture null distribution . we further revealed that most of the identified regions , in which genes behave as active mediators , were cancer type-specific and exhibited a full mediation from DNA methylation CpG sites to the survival risk of various types of cancers . overall , IUSMMT represents an effective and powerful alternative for survival mediation analysis ; our results also provide new insights into the functional role of DNA and gene expression in cancer progression/prognosis and demonstrate potential therapeutic targets for future clinical practice .
we investigated the gene regulatory network controlling predatory vs . non-predatory dimorphism in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus and found that it consists of genes of extremely different age classes . we isolated mutants in the conserved nuclear hormone receptor nhr-1 with previously unseen phenotypic effects . they disrupt mouth-form determination and result in animals combining features of both wild-type morphs , but no intermediate morphology . these mutants encode extracellular proteins that have no orthologs in Caenorhabditis elegans and result from lineage-specific expansions in pharyngeal gland cell . the origin of feeding plasticity involved novelty at the level of genes , cells and behavior .
a newly developed spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte computer model integrates mitochondrial ca2+ cycling and complex signaling pathways to investigate the mechanisms of Ca2+ alternans during mitochondrial depolarization . further examination reveals that the redox effect of ROS on ryanodine receptors and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2 +-ATPase synergistically promotes alternans . we find that elevated ROS in response to mitochondrial repolarization plays a critical role in promoting ca2 + alternans under abnormal mitochondrial degradation . in this study , we use a new spatial ventricular computer model that integrate mitochondrial mitochondrial calcium exchange , ATP generation , and production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS ) is a zoonosis characterized by clinical features of high fever , hemorrhage , and renal damage . in this paper , we conducted geostatistical analysis for investigating the associations of rapid urbanization , water bodies and other factors on the spatiotemporal dynamics of hrs from year 2005 to 2018 in Xi’an City , Northwest china . the results revealed an evident epidemic aggregation in the incidence of HFr within the radii of 696 . 15 m and 1575 . 39 m , which represented significant thresholds . a phenomenal fluctuation in periodic time series was found to greatly affect the incidence rate in two different time phases .
Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the stomach of approximately half of the world’s population . the presence of subgroups with unique genetic and phenotypic properties suggest complex selective forces and multiple niches within the stomach during chronic infection . this project leverages a collection of 39 clinical isolates acquired prospectively from a single subject at two time points and from multiple gastric sites . to define how within-host diversity contributes to phenophages related to bacterial morphology , ability to induce inflammatory cytokines , and mouse colonization . a maximum likelihood tree based on genetic similarity clusters isolates from each time point separately . genome sequence analysis identified 1 , 767 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms ( nSNPs ) across isolates .
soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections cause significant morbidity in children and women of reproductive age . despite its beneficial impact , both the prevalence and the intensity of STH infections remain high , and the intervention has been insufficient in controlling these infections . this is probably due to a combination of irregular PC , climatic conditions favourable to STH transmission , the low sensitivity of Trichuris trichiura to benzimidazoles , high population density and poor sanitation coverage . we conducted a second STH survey in 2011 , in 24 schools estimated a prevalence of 89% ; after this survey , PC was regularly administered until 2018 .
chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) is an enveloped virus belonging to the Togaviridae family and enters its host cell primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis . Upon internalization , the endocytic vesicle containing the virus particle moves through the cell and delivers the virus to early endosomes where membrane fusion is observed . in this study , we examined the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of infection and dissected the intracellular trafficking behavior of a cellular location that is beneficial for establishing infection or aids in nucleocapsid uncoating .
in order to adjust to changing environmental conditions , bacteria use nucleotide second messengers to transduce external signals and translate them into a specific cellular response . in addition to the well-established role of this second messenger in the control of potassium homeostasis , we observed that glutamate is as toxic as potassium for a c-di-AMP-free strain of the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis . this work aimed to isolate suppressor mutants that allow growth of the c . osmolytes toxicity by a combination of mutations that affect phospholipid biosynthesis and a particular gain-of-function mutation of a mechanosensitive channel of small conductance ( YfkC ) resulting in the acquisition of an a device for glutamates export .
epithelial cell cancers are characterized by endemic burkitt lymphoma and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphomas in immunocompromised hosts . by learning how EBV breaches barriers to cell proliferation , we hope to undermine those strategies to treat EBV lymphomas and potentially other cancers . this observation prompted us to examine the consequences on DNA repair since homologous recombination repair , the most error-free form , requires phosphoChk1 , and thereby curtails activation of the intra-S phase cell-cycle checkpoint , a potent barrier to oncogene-driven proliferation . the resulting reliance on error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining ( MMEJ ) repair makes EBV-transformed cells susceptible to PARP inhibition and simultaneous accrual of genome-wide deletions and insertions resulting from synthesis-dependent MMEj .
background : Buruli ulcer is one of the 20 neglected tropical diseases in the world . this necrotizing hypodermitis is a chronic debilitating disease caused by an environmental Mycobacterium ulcerans . the mode of transmission is unclear , hindering the implementation of adequate prevention for the population . presently , early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimizing morbidity , costs and preventing long-term disability.materials and methods : due to the low PCR confirmation rate in endemic african countries ( under 30% in 2018 ) for numerous identified reasons within this article , 11 laboratories decided to combine their efforts to create the network “BU-LABNET” in 2019 .
the co-localization of cluster-of-Differentiation-44 protein ( CD44 ) and cytoplasmic adaptors in specific membrane environments is crucial for cell adhesion and migration . the molecular mechanism explaining how CD44 is migrating into and out of the lipid raft domains and its dependence on both palmitoylations and the presence of phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-biphosphate ( PIP2 ) lipids remains , however , elusive.
the rafts of fire ants ( Solenopsis invicta ) are often studied in this context for their ability to create aggregated structures comprised entirely of their own bodies , including tether-like protrusions that facilitate exploration of and escape from flooded environments . although similar protruders are observed in cytoskeletons and cellular aggregates , they are generally dependent on morphogens or external gradients leaving the isolated role of local interactions poorly understood . here we demonstrate through an ant-inspired , agent-based numerical model how protruds in ant raft swarm robotics may emerge spontaneously due to local interactions .
molestus forskal ( Cx . quinquefasciatus ) is a complex olfactory sensory system , which is characterized by a variety of blood-feeding behaviors . the molecular mechanisms of the molecular system of the Culex pipiens complex are closely related to their olefactory gene expression , and their biological functions were described by bioinformatics analysis . a quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) was applied to validate the RNA-seq data.resultsin total , 5 , 7 , 24 and 3 , the dsRNA groups of the two subspecies were identified , respectively . most of the selected ORs were expressed in both subspecy but showed divergence in expression level .
we propose a computational model of the hippocampal CA1 network , which describes the formation , dynamics and stabilization of place fields . we show that although somatic disinhibition is sufficient to form places fields , dendritic inhibition along with synaptic plasticity is necessary for place field stabilization . our model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity , such that place cells return to their baseline firing rate after exploration .
the sensitivity of Molecular xenomonitoring ( MX ) for detecting onchocerciasis-positive communities has not previously been evaluated . we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the prevalence of Onchocerca volvulus DNA in wild-caught Simulium spp . flies ( Mx rate ) and corresponding prevalence of microfilaria ( mf ) in humans.materials and methodswe identified 15 relevant studies , with 13 studies comprising 34 study communities included in the quantitative analyses.resultsmf prevalence accounting for half of the variation in MX rate ( R2 0 . 50 , p0. 001 ) . most communities were at advanced stages towards elimination and had no or extremely low human prevalence .
phagocytosis may be characterized by the lectin pathway of complement . despite their obvious importance , the roles played by these proteins have never been investigated in leprosy disease . we haplotyped five MASP1 polymorphisms by multiplex sequence-specific PCR ( intronic rs7609662*G>A and rns13064994*C>T , exon 12 3’-untranslated rrs72549262*c>G , ris1109452*C >A ) and measured serum levels in 196 lepromatous and 193 controls . the results suggest that a phage - mediated phagocytes may be responsible for the role of these proteins . however , there is a need for a better understanding of the role that these proteins play in the pathogenesis of lepronosis . in this paper , we characterized five mASP1 , 5 kDa ( MAp44 ) .
nongenetic phenotypic variation can either speed up or slow down adaptive evolution . we show that it can speed up evolution in environments where available carbon and energy sources change over time . to this end , we use an experimentally validated model of Escherichia coli growth on two alternative carbon sources , glucose and acetate . Consequently , populations experience a bottleneck when the environment changes from the superior to the inferior carbon source . in doing so , it can decrease the severity of the bottleneck and increase mean population fitness whenever this fitness is low .
a novel RNA-Protein interaction detection assay was used to detect proteins that directly or indirectly bind to dengue viral genomes in infected mosquito cells . Membrane-associated mosquito proteins Sec61A1 and Loquacious ( Loqs ) were found to be in complex with the viral RNA . co-localization and pull-down assays showed that both Sec61a1 and loqs have pro-viral functions in the dengue virus infectious cycle .
abstracttemporal environmental variations affect diversity in communities of competing populations . in particular , the covariance between competition and environment is known to facilitate invasions of rare species via the storage effect . here we present a quantitative study of the effects of temporal variations in two-species and in diverse communities . four scenarios are compared : environmental variations may be either periodic ( seasonal ) or stochastic , and the dynamics may support the storage effects ( global competition , or not , local competition ) .
phylogenetic analysis can broadly identify functional determinants in RNA sequences and functional sites , and reveal details on the basis of RNA molecular functions . here , we seek to exploit the evolutionary record of variation and divergence read from sequence comparisons . we assigned a relative rank of importance to every base in a study of 1070 functional RNAs , including the ribosome . in turn , these clusters mapped functional regions for catalysis , binding proteins and drugs , post-transcriptional modification , deleterious mutations ; whereas the quantitative quality of these clustered in secondary and tertiary structures , smoother structural distributions of evolutionary important nucleotides improved functional site predictions . this work is broadly relevant to studies of structure-function in ribonucleic acids .
we investigate the source detection problem in epidemiology , which is one of the most important issues for control of epidemics . Mathematically , we reformulate the problem as one of identifying the relevant component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model . Focusing on the study of cholera and diseases with similar modes of transmission , our calibrate the parameters of our mixture model using human mobility networks within a stochastic , spatially explicit epidemiological model for waterborne disease . we adopt a Bayesian perspective , so that prior information on source location can be incorporated ( e . g. , reflecting the impact of local conditions ) .
background : multiplex imaging techniques have expanded the depth of information that can be captured within a single tissue sample by allowing for panels with dozens of markers . despite this increase in capacity , space on the panel is still limited due to technical artifacts , tissue loss , and long imaging acquisition time . selecting which markers to include on a panel is important , since removing important markers will result in a loss of biologically relevant information , but identifying redundant markers will provide a room for other markers.materials and methods : here we examine several panel selection approaches and evaluate them based on their ability to reconstruct the full panel images and information within breast cancer tissue microarray datasets using cyclic immunofluorescence as a proof of concept . here we show that all methods perform adequately and can re-capture cell types using only 18 of 25 markers ( 72% of the original panel size ) . the correlation-based selection methods achieved the best single-cell marker mean intensity predictions with a Spearman correlation of 0 . 90 with the reduced panel .
leptospirosis has been described as a biphasic disease consisting of hematogenous dissemination to major organs in the acute phase and asymptomatic renal colonization in the chronic phase . a number of observational studies have suggested an association between lesions and chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . we investigated the dynamics of lesions in the kidney to understand the relationship between them , and also investigated the extent of renal dysfunction , using a hamster model.methodshamsters ( n = 68 ) were subcutaneously infected with 1  104 cells of the Leptospira interrogans serovar Manilae strain UP-MMC-SM . the kidneys showed patchy lesions of atrophic tubules , a finding of chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis .
background : the factors that influence in-hospital death of HIV/AIDS patients with Talaromyces marneffei infection are not completely clear.objectives:to develop a predictive model to identify relevant prognostic factors to predict death and appears to be essential to reducing in -hospital mortality.materials and methods : a total of 1927 patients were included in the Fourth People’s Hospital of Nanning , Guangxi , from January 2012 to June 2019 . clinical features were selected and used to train four different machine learning models ( logistic regression , XGBoost , KNN , and SVM ) to predict the treatment outcome of hospitalized patients.results:the most common complications/coinfections were pneumonia ( 68 . 9% ) , followed by oral candida ( 47. 5% ) and tuberculosis ( 40. 6%).conclusion:this model may have potential application in mortality prediction and high-risk factor identification in the talarom
human toxocariasis has been identified as an under-diagnosed parasitic zoonosis and health disparity of significant public health importance in the united states due to its high seropositivity among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups , and possible links to cognitive and developmental delays . through microscopy and quantitative PCR , we detected that Toxocara eggs are widespread in New York City public spaces , with evidence of significant levels of contamination in all five boroughs .
envenoming by scorpions in genus Tityus is a public health problem in tropical America . we studied the lethality , composition , antigenicity , and enzymatic activity of venom from a T . trivittatus population found further north in urban areas of eastern Paraguay , where it has caused serious entnomation of children . our results indicate that the population is of medical importance as it produces a potently toxic venum with an LD50 around 1 . 19 mg/kg . in preliminary mouse bioassays was complete when using Brazilian anti-T . serrulatus antivenom but only partial when using Argentinean anti-toxin Tt1g , others are population-specific .
bat-pollinated flowers have to attract their pollinators in absence of light and therefore some species developed specialized echoic floral parts . these parts are usually concave shaped and act like acoustic retroreflectors making the flowers scoustically conspicuous to the bats . however , it remains unclear whether other bat-polelinated plant species also show a specialized floral part . we recorded a dataset of 32320 flower echoes , collected from 168 individual flowers belonging to 12 different species . 6 of these species were pollinated by bats and 6 species were hummingbirds.resultswe analyzed the spectral target strength of the flowers and trained a convolutional neural network ( CNN ) on spectrograms of the flower  echo . a good classification accuracy by our CNN ( up to 84% ) can be achieved with only one echo to classify the 12 different plant species , both bat-polilinated and otherwise .
the intermediate snail host of Schistosoma is the most effective way to control schistosomiasis and the most important first step is to accurately identify the snail habitats . due to the substantial resources required for traditional , manual snail-searching in the field , and potential risk of miss-classification by remote sensing , more convenient and precise methods are urgently needed . a total of 36 environmental variables covering the whole province were collected together with 12 different models , such as area under the curve , Kappa , percent correctly classified ( PCC ) , sensitivity and specificity . we found the presence-absence models performing better than those based on presence-only .
the emergence of ABZ resistance in this parasite has prompted studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon . we first determined that the iron-containing cofactor heme induces higher mRNA expression levels of flavohemoglobin ( gFlHb ) in the presence of metronidazole ( mTZ ) and sulfone forms , despite lacking canonical enzymes involved in these processes , such as cytochrome P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases ( FMOs ) . this study aims to identify the enzyme responsible for ABz metabolism and its role in a passive pharmacokinetic mechanism of resistance in G . duodenalis trophozoites .
we studied an unresolved conundrum of sulfur fixation in yeast , in which organosulfur auxotrophy caused by deletion of the homocysteine synthase Met17p is overcome when cells are inoculated at high cell density . in combining the use of self-establishing metabolically cooperating ( seMeCo ) communities with proteomic , genetic , and biochemical approaches , we discovered an uncharacterized gene product YLL058Wp , herein named Hydrogen Sulfide Utilizing-1 ( Hsu1p ) . we found a gene product named hydrogen sulfides Utilizing 1 ( HSU1 ) that acts as a homocisteine . the microbial communities facilitate their basic metabolic capacity to overcome sulfur limitation . our results show that cells can cooperate to achieve sulfur fixations , indicating that the collective properties of sulphur ions leaked from met17 cells into O-acetyl-homoserine and forming homocetyle .
zonula adherens ( ZA ) phosphorylation of Partitioning defective protein 3 ( Par3 ) via a signaling cascade including G protein-coupled receptor , small GTPase Cell division cycle 42 ( Cdc42 ) and atypical Protein kinasen C ( aPKC ) caused ZA disassembly at tricellular contacts , consequently leading to patency enlargement . this study provides new insight into how JH stimulates insect vitellogenesis and egg production via inducing the opening of paracellular route for vitellogenin transport crossing the follicular epithelium barrier . the mechanisms underlying patency opening are poorly understood .
background : alcoholic-related liver disease ( ALD ) is the cause of more than half of all liver-related deaths . the majority of ALD patients are only diagnosed by the time ALD has reached decompensated cirrhosis , a symptomatic phase marked by the development of complications as bleeding and ascites . here , we use data from the Danish health registries covering the entire population of Denmark during nineteen years ( 1996–2014 ) to examine if it is possible to identify patients likely to develop alcoholic liver fibrosis ( ALC ) , and to highlight meaningful downstream diagnoses that represent its progression to liver failure.materials and methods : we perform matched case–control study using the group of patients with ALC as cases and their matched patients with non-ALD as controls.results:the majority of aLC patients are diagnosed with ALF , as these are largely asymptomatic . this study highlights the potential of this approach to uncover knowledge in registry data related to ALD.conclusion:the main goal of this study is to discover relevant upstream diagnoses helping to understand
the intrinsic mechanisms underlying this developmentally programmed dendrite regeneration and whether it shares common machinery with injury-induced regeneration remain largely unknown . here we show that the microRNA miR-87 is a critical regulator of dendritic regeneration in Drosophila . genetic analyses indicate that the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack69 ( Ttk69 ) is an effective functional target for mir-87-mediated repression as ttk68 expression is increased in miR -87 knockout neurons , whereas miR87 overexpression in C4da neurons leads to precocious initiation of demdrite regrowth at least in part through suppressing the transcriptionally-programmed pruning . we further show that miR
V9V2 T cells rapidly respond to phosphoantigens produced by Plasmodium falciparum in an innate-like manner , without prior antigen exposure or processing . however , repeated malaria causes V2 cells to decline both in frequency and in malaria-responsiveness , and to exhibit numerous transcriptional and phenotypic changes , including upregulation of the Fc receptor CD16 . here we investigate the functional role of CD16 on the immune response to malaria .

background : enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) is one of the top aetiologic agents of diarrhea in children under the age of 5 in low-middle income countries ( LMICs ) . the lack of point of care diagnostic tools for routine ETEC diagnosis results in limited data regarding the actual burden and epidemiology in the endemic areas.methods:we conducted a cross-sectional study of 324 randomly selected stool samples from children under 5 presenting with moderate to severe diarrhea ( MSD ).results:the RLDT was evaluated by targeting three ETEC genes [heat labile toxin ( LT ) and heat stable toxins ( STh and STp ] . we additionally described the prevalence and seasonality of ETEC in stool as a point-of-care diagnostic assay in a resource-limited setting.conclusion:we evaluated performance of the novel Rapid LAMP based Diagnostic Test ( RL
longitudinal intervention studies with repeated measurements over time are an important type of experimental design in biomedical research . due to the advent of “omics”-sciences ( genomics , transcriptomics , proteomics ) , longitudinal studies generate increasingly multivariate outcome data . analysis of such data must take both the longitudinal intervention structure and multivariates nature of the data into account . this methodology has not yet been developed for the more complex designs often found in longitudinal intervention studies , which may be unbalanced , involve randomized interventions , and have substantial missing data , . here we describe a new methodology , repeated measures ASCA+ ( RM-ASCA+ ) and show how it can be used to model metabolic changes over time .
we study the time evolution of symptoms ( signs ) with some defects in the dynamics of a reaction network as a ( microscopic ) model for the progress of disease phenotypes . to this end , we take a large population of reaction networks and follow the stochastic dynamics of the system to see how the development of defects affects the macroscopic states of the signs probability distribution . we start from some plausible definitions for the healthy and disease states along with a dynamical modeling for the emergence of diseases by a reverse simulated annealing algorithm . the healthy state is defined as the state of maximum objective function , which here is the sum of mutual information between a subset of signal variables and the subsets of assigned response variables .
the relationship between transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sARS-CoV-2 ) and the amount of virus present in the proximity of a susceptible host is not understood . here , we developed a within-host and aerosol mathematical model and used it to determine the relation between viral kinetics in the upper respiratory track , viral kinase in the aerosols , and new transmissions in golden hamsters challenged with ssr . we determined that infectious virus shedding early in infection correlate with transmission events , shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection are a poor indicator of transmission .
Counting the number of species , items , or genes that are shared between two groups , sets , and communities is a simple calculation when sampling is complete . however , when only partial samples are available , quantifying the overlap between two communities becomes an estimation problem . to calculate normalized measures of -diversity , one must also estimate the total sizes of the communities being compared . here , we address communities of unknown size and show that this produces systematically better estimates —both in terms of central estimates and quantification of uncertainty in those estimates .
objective : to determine the diagnostic validity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and Rapid Diagnostic Tests ( RDT ) among individuals with suspected chronic Chagas Disease ( CD ) . methods : a search was made for studies with lISA and RDT assays validity estimates as eligibility criteria , published between 2010 and 2020 on PubMed , Web of Science , Scopus , and LILACS . this way , we extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool.results:the bivariate random effects model was also used to estimate the overall sensitivity and specificity through forest-plots , ROC space and we visually assessed the heterogeneity between studies . we used Deeks’ test to assess the likelihood of publication bias .
we present a new computational model that ( i ) simultaneously regards release , diffusion and uptake of dopamine , ( II ) considers multiple terminal release events and ( III ) comprises both synaptic and volume transmission by incorporating the geometry of the synaptical cleft . further , although synaptica doppamine diffuses into extra-synaptic space , we were able to validate our model in that it simulates concentration values comparable to physiological values observed in empirical studies . we found different variability characteristics between the three settings , which may in part account for differences in empirical observations . however , in humans , DA tone is assumed to impact on phasic and hence on the integration of reward-related signals , with relevant implications for addictive- and compulsive-like behavior .
background : female tick salivary glands undergo rapid degeneration several days post engorgement . this degeneration may be caused by the increased concentration of ecdysone in the hemolymph during the fast feeding period and both autophagy and apoptosis occur . in this work , we explored the regulatory role of Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides autophagidy-related 5 ( RhATG5 ) in the degeneration of tick salivaries . we investigated the regulation role of the recombinant RhatG5 and caspase gene expression peaks during the rapid feeding phase .
yellow fever ( yF ) has seen dramatic changes to its incidence and geographic extent , with the largest outbreaks in South America since 1940 occurring in the previously unaffected South-East Atlantic coast of Brazil in 2016–2019 . although habitat fragmentation and land-cover have previously been implicated in zoonotic disease , their role in YF has not yet been examined . here , we examined the extent to which vegetation , soil-cover , climate and host population predicted the numbers of months a location reported Yf per year and by each month over the time-period , averaging over the years of the study period , and a seasonal model looking at intra-annual differences by month . the best performing models , as measured by the Akaike Information Criterion ( aIC ) , were combined to create ensemble models to describe interannual and seasonal variation in yf , both seasonally and across the period 2003–2016 . each was fit using hierarchical negative-binomial regression in an exhaustive model fitting process .
objective : to investigate cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying Pavlovian biases on instrumental behavior in both clinical OCD patients and healthy controls using a Pavlovin-Instrumental Transfer task.materials and methods : thirty-one patients and 30 healthy controls completed a palovia-instrumental transfer ( PIT ) phase in which participants performed instrumental training for positive , negative and neutral cues , and a PIT phase , which included instrumental training , palovians training for negative , neutral and positive cue . Behavioral and computational results indicated a weaker Pavlovic influence on instrumental behaviors than in HC , especially for negative ( previously rewarded ) Pavlovians . our results contrast with the increased PIT effects reported for another set of disorders characterized by compulsivity , substance use disorders , in which a negative cue is present.results:pIT is typically evidenced by increased responding in the presence of a positive ( previously
a potent class of pantothenamides ( PanAms ) , pan analogs , which target coenzyme A ( CoA )-utilizing enzymes . the potential of panams to target multiple downstream pathways make them a promising compound class as broad antiparasitic drugs against other apicomplexans . in this review , we summarize the recent advances in understanding the pan and CoA biosynthesis pathways , and the suitability of these pathways as drug targets in Apicomplexa , with a particular focus on the cyst-forming coccidian , toxoplasma gondii , the haemosporidian - Plasmodium falciparum .
membrane contact probability ( MCP ) is a characteristic and predictive quantity of membrane proteins , and it can be predicted for any given sequence with a machine learning-based method by utilizing a training dataset extracted from MemProtMD , a database generated from molecular dynamics simulations for the membrane proteins with an known structure . we demonstrate that MCP can be used to systematically improve the prediction precision of the protein contact maps and structures . here , we propose the membrane contact likelihood ( mcc ) to describe the likelihood of the amino acids of a given sequence being in direct contact with the acyl chains of lipid molecules .
the COVID-19 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) pandemic is mitigated by several non-pharmaceutical interventions , but it is hard to predict which of these are the most effective for a given population . we developed the computationally effective and scalable , agent-based microsimulation framework PanSim , allowing us to test control measures in multiple infection waves caused by the spread of a new virus variant in a city-sized societal environment using a unified framework fitted to realistic data .
environmental enteric dysfunction ( EED ) is a widespread , poorly understood , and highly consequential disorder , which might be caused by multiple contributing processes , in different regions of the world . we propose the first EED histology index for interpreting duodenal biopsies from two cohorts where EED is prevalent ( Pakistan , Zambia ) and North American children with and without gluten sensitive enteropathy ( GSE ) were processed for routine hematoxylin & eosin staining and scanned to produce whole slide images ( WSIs ) which we shared among study pathologists via a secure web browser-based platform . a semi-quantitative scoring index composed of 11 parameters encompassing tissue injury and response patterns commonly observed in routine clinical practice was constructed by three gastrointestinal pathologists , with input from EED experts . eight of the 11 histologic scoring parameters showed useful degrees of variation . the overall concordance across all parameters was 96% weighted agreement , kappa 0 . 70 ; and Gwet’s AC
objective : to account for action visibility and provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints , we introduce a new game-theoretic setting called transparent games , where each player has a certain probability of observing the partner’s choice before deciding on its own action . we demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partner's choices before one’s own decision substantially changes the evolutionary successful strategies . by means of evolutionary simulations , our results have implications for studies of human and animal social behaviour , especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions.results:the results of this study were compared between the two games . a total of 58 players were surveyed , and a large probability of watching the partner 's choice prior to deciding upon its own actions . in both games  , “Win–stay , lose-shift” and “Tit-for-tat” strategies are predominant for moderate transparency , while a “Leader-Follower” strategy emerges for high transparency .
alpha Thalassemia/mental Retardation syndrome X-Linked ( ATRX ) is a recombination-based mechanism referred to as alternative lengthening of telomeres ( ALT ) that leads to long and heterogenous telore length distributions . the loss of aTRX combined with a crisis in HCT116 epithelial cancer cells led to the initiation of an ALT-like pathway . however , this process was transient and the cells either died or the escape from crisis was associated with the onset of the ALT pathway in human fibroblasts and enables a transient activation of ALT in human cells . in these cells , a rapid and precise telolimeric elongation and the induction of C-circles was observed . also , loss of ATRx , coupled with teleomere dysfunction during crisis , is sufficient to initiate activation , and that it confers replicative immortality in human cancer cells.
toxoplasma gondii possesses an armada of secreted virulent factors that enable parasite invasion and survival into host cells . these factors are contained in specific secretory organelles , the rhoptries , micronemes and dense granules that release their content upon host cell recognition . constitutive secretion remains a poorly explored aspect of eukaryotic cells vesicular trafficking . here , we investigated the role of the small GTPase Rab11A , a known regulator of exocytosis .
the stimulation of a single neuron in the rat somatosensory cortex can elicit a behavioral response . Biological mechanisms that can potentially suppress a constant input signal are present in the dynamics of both neurons and synapses and seem ideal candidates to explain these experimental findings . here , we study a large network of integrate-and-fire neurons with several salient features of neuronal populations . the model includes cellular spike-frequency adaptation , experimentally constrained numbers and types of chemical synapase endowed with short-term plasticity , and gap junctions . we suggest that cellular and synaptic adaptation mechanisms alone may not suffice to account for the experimental results if the local network activity is read out by an integrator .
the somatic mutation load in the skin of healthy humans has so far not been accurately assessed because the low number of mutations from current sequencing methodologies preclude the distinction between sequencing errors and true somatic genome changes . in this work , we sequenced genomes of single cell-derived clonal lineages obtained from primary skin cells of a large cohort of healthy individuals across a wide range of ages . we demonstrate that UV-induced base substitutions , insertions and deletions are prominent even in sun-shielded skin . the endogenously induced somatic mutants and indels also demonstrate a linear increase with age , while ultraviolet-induced mutation load is age-independent . thus , somatic changes in skin cells reflect the interplay of environmental and endogenous factors in facilitating genome instability and carcinogenesis .

background : the prevalence of parasitic skin diseases among schoolchildren is not reported . this study aimed to assess the occurrence and risk factors of skin infections among rural schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia by combining a frequentist and a Bayesian approach . we detected potential risk factors for scabies , tungiasis , and tinea infections and recorded their hygienic practices and socio-demographic information.materials and methods : utilizing three-stage random sampling , we assessed 864 schoolchildren aged 7–14 years from the Wonago district in southern southern Ethiopia.results:the frequentist model revealed a clustering effect of 8 . 8% at the classroom level and an insignificant effect at the school level . the frequentist models revealed potential risk factor for skin infections .
pathogenic mycobacteria actively dysregulate protective host immune signalling pathways during infection to drive the formation of permissive granuloma microenvironments . Dynamic regulation of host microRNA ( miRNA ) expression is a conserved feature of mycobacterial infections across host-pathogen pairings . here we examine the role of miR-206 in the zebrafish model of Mycobacterium marinum infection , which allows investigation of the early stages of granularomas formation .
graph neural network ( GNN ) models are suited for this purpose , by showing how they can be applied to predict cell fate in tissues and utilized to infer the cell interactions governing the multicellular dynamics . this approach demonstrates how the GNN framework is powerful in inferring general cell interaction rules from live data without prior knowledge of the signaling involved . here , we demonstrate that graph neural networks ( gNNs ) model is suited to this purpose in determining cell fate . we demonstrate how these models can be used to predict the cell fate of tissues and used to induc cell interactions that depend on the region of the body . in this study , a model based on live data , where spatiotemporal graphs constructed from cell tracks and cell contacts are given as inputs , GNN discovers distinct neighbor cell fate coordination rules that depend upon the region .
tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis ( TSCCA ) is able to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and capture both the cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations . in this study , we present a method for identifying cancer-associated cancer-related miRNAs across multiple cancer types using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database . these modules can advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and provide insights into miRNA -based treatments for cancer .
synaptic plasticity is subjected to activity-dependent changes on short- and long time scales . while short-term changes decay over minutes , long-term modifications last from hours up to a lifetime and are thought to constitute the basis of learning and memory . both plasticity mechanisms have been studied extensively but how their interaction shapes synaptically dynamics is little known . to investigate how both short- or long- term plasticity together control the induction of synaptice depression and potentiation , we used numerical simulations and mathematical analysis of a calcium-based model , where pre- and postsynaptic activity induces calcium transients driving synaptica long-lasting plasticity . we found that the model implementing known synaptical short-timing and firing rate changes on plasticity can be successfully fitted to longitudinal plasticity data obtained in visual- and somatosensory cortex . our findings suggest that short-  and long-year plasticity are together tuned to adapt plasticity to area-specific activity statistics such as firing rates .
background : bats are the natural reservoir host host for a number of zoonotic viruses , including Hendra virus ( HeV ) which causes severe clinical disease in humans and other susceptible hosts . information on the early host response to infection in vivo is lacking and there is no comparative data on responses in bats compared with animals that succumb to disease.methods:in this study , we examined the sites of HeV replication and the immune response of infected Australian black flying foxes and ferrets at 12 , 36 and 60 hours post exposure ( hpe ) to obtain a global overview of viral and host protein expression.results:the mRNA expression of IFNs revealed antagonism of type I and III , and a significant increase in the chemokine , CXCL10 , in bat lung and spleen following infection.conclusion:the presence of viral RNA and antigen was detected at 60 , 60 and 60 hour post exposure . there was evidence of widespread viral antigen by 60
background : the presence of subtypes within many phenotypes is frequently unknown . we present CLiP ( Correlated Liability Predictors ) , a method to detect heterogeneity in single GWAS cohorts.methods:we demonstrate mathematically and through simulation that among i. i . d . homogeneous cases generated by a liability threshold model , significant anti-correlations are expected between otherwise independent predictors due to ascertainment on the hidden liability score.results:a total of 50 , 000 cases and controls collected by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium , we computed a weighted sum of correlations between SNPs contributing to a PRS on the case/control liability scale.conclusions:the presence of heteroglycemia from distinct genomic etiologies , confounding by covariates , or mislabeling , these correlation patterns are altered predictably .
we aimed to utilize convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) to shorten the timing required for identification of influenza-induced cytopathic effects ( CPE ) and to improve the assay sensitivity . a simple CNN model with larger sizes of filters and max-pooling kernels was constructed in the absence of transfer learning . the performance of the model was tested by using extra 400 images and the percentage of correct recognition was 99 . 75% . to further examine the limit of our model in evaluating the changes of CPE overtime , additional 1190 images from a new experiment were used to train the model .
RIP Homotypic Interaction Motif ( RHIM ) -containing proteins are known to encode a number of inhibitors of host cell death , including RIP zoster virus ( VZV ) and RIPK3 that stabilise the necrosome in TNF-induced necroptosis . we have identified a novel viral RIPRHIM in the VzV capsid triplex protein , open reading frame ( ORF ) 20 , that acts as a host cells death inhibitor . however , the ORF20 rHIM is capable of forming fibrillar functional amyloid complexes with human ZBP1 , a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acid , and the viral RHIm in M45 from murine cytomegalovirus that inhibits cell death.
we aimed to quantify the contributions of exposure , hazard , and vulnerability to the presence and intensity of Schistosoma haematobium re-infection.methodsin 13 villages along the Senegal River , we collected parasitological data from 821 school-aged children , survey data from 411 households where those children resided and ecological data from all 24 village water access sites . we fit mixed-effects logistic and negative binomial regressions with indices of exposure ( wi = 0 . 95 ) was the most important component of S . haemobium intensity , followed by vulnerability ( i.e. , 1 . 97 ) . in the mean age of the children ( p = 0.001 ) and a positive association between exposure and infection intensity ( RR 2 .
a limiting factor in evaluating medical countermeasures against Lassa fever ( LF ) is a lack of well characterized animal models outside of those based on infection with LASV strain Josiah originating form Sierra Leone , circa 1976 . here we genetically characterize five recent LASV isolates collected from the 2018 outbreak in Nigeria . despite being closely related and from the same spatial / geographic region of Nigeria , only one of the three isolates proved lethal in strain 13 guinea pigs and non-human primates ( NHP ) . this isolate exhibited atypical pathogenesis characteristics in the NHP model , most notably respiratory failure , not commonly described in hemorrhagic cases of LF.

antibodies targeting the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) envelope glycoprotein E2 are associated with delayed disease progression , and these antibodies can also facilitate spontaneous clearance of infection in some individuals . however , many infected people demonstrate low titer and delayed anti-E2 antibody responses . we detected HCV E2-specific ( sE2- ) B cells directly ex vivo at multiple acute infection timepoints in 29 HCV-infected subjects . by staining lymphocytes with a cocktail of soluble E2 glycoproteins , we performed multi-dimensional flow cytometric analysis of csBC from both persistence and clearance subjects , frequencies of resting memory B cells ( rMBC ) were reduced , activated MBC ( actMBC) and tissue-like tlMBC were increased and expression of FCRL5 , an IgG receptor , was significantly upregulated . in se2+ rmc , the expression of s
